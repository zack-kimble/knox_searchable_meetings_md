| 0:01:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| I'd like to make a few remarks about the workshop that we're going to have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=90)|
| 0:01:32| First of all, we do have an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| We're going to have the administration present the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| That will run around 20, 25 minutes, and then we'll have time for council to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| and to comment, and then at the end we will open it up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| I'm going to allow about five more minutes for anyone who has not signed up for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| If you haven't, please come forward, but then after that we're going to cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| And what we would like to do, as far as public forum goes, is that if you have heard something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=118)|
| 0:02:06| that's already been said, we, right now I think we have 15 people signed up, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| we would like to do is to allow as much time as possible for those people both for and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| But also what we would like is if someone has already said what you've already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| or if you want to get together with two or three of you and talk about having one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| do that, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| What we're interested in is we are interested in hearing what you have to say, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| remember it's not a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| It's just mainly that we listen, we don't comment to the things that you have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| during public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| Also, you will have additional opportunities to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| There will be two council meetings when this comes before council in terms of if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| things that you want to say or something that has not been said already, you know, feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Also, all council members are open to hear you both through emails or text or telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| conversations, so feel free to contact any of us if you have anything to say or you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| strongly one way or the other on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| So in a few minutes I will call it into the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| So with that, we're going to turn it over to Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=195)|
| 0:03:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor Grieve, and thank you, council, for coming and engaging with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| We've seen many of you at our early engagements, we've been hearing from people all across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| the spectrum on this for many months, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| We want to continue to receive input and have a good dialogue today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| Obviously, what we're talking about today is regulating short-term rentals, and we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| to keep in mind that the starting point for this is that present we do not have any enabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| ordinance that allows short-term rentals outside of a very small number of bed and breakfasts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Many short-term rentals, we'll end up referring to them often, I'm sure, in our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| as Airbnb, but we want to keep in mind there are other platforms other than Airbnb that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| engage in short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| So what we'll do is start off, and we're going to go through here as quickly as we can, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| we don't want to miss anything and want to give plenty of time to discuss the meat and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| potatoes of the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| I'm going to go through and describe how we got here and what our process has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| what our policy considerations have been, what our guiding principles have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Then I'm going to turn it over to Chris DeCuccaro from the Law Department, who's going to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| the ordinance in depth, and then Jesse Mayshark is going to come and discuss some of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| overriding concerns we have addressed in this entire process, including the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| environment we're in at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| This is a consideration, short-term rentals, that cities all over the country have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| We think we are approaching it at about the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| We're not the first in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| We get to learn from those who went in first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| There have been plenty of cities that are finding themselves that they need to revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Others are waiting to see as things develop further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| We think now, since we're dealing with an existing phenomenon, this is the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| time to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Again, they fall into, for purposes of our discussion, really two major categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| They involve this rental of something that started with just the couch sharing to renting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| a part of one's home or a carriage house in an owner-occupied situation, all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| what those who are called Type 1 in the industry, we learned the other day, to Type 2, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| are the non-owner-occupied short-term rentals where people have purchased homes and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| them exclusively for that purpose but don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| This is a growing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| We've got 200 or 300 operating in the city of Knoxville currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| We've got some numbers we want to talk about a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| I think the main one we might want to look at is the number of guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| From Airbnb, we've had 8,000 guest arrivals in Knoxville in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| That has been increasing, but I would say in the last three years, we've easily had somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| in the vicinity of 20,000 probably over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| The average length of stay is 2.6 nights, and many people in Knoxville also use these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| in other places, hence the outbound guest arrivals in the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Nights hosted per year for a typical listing is 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| What you have is, you can see the numbers, a little over half for the entire home, 41%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| private space in the home, and a very small number sharing a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| I want to add right now, because this will be coming up, you'll see, well, this is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| existing phenomenon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Again, in Knoxville, this is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| We've got 8,000 people here in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| We have had very, very few complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| I believe the number is five over the last three years, which is .00 whatever, extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| out to the decimal point in terms of incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Of those, most of those complaints have been the very fact that somebody is operating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| short-term rental rather than a problem with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| We have had a couple of complaints that are more substantial that have involved a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| non-owner occupied or a type two that have been dealt with, and they're not happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| I want to go ahead and make sure that that's part of our experience here, because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| coming into an existing, we're getting into a parade that's already going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| While we discuss that, I think part of our concern is that we realize that this is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| existing enterprise all over the country, and what we're trying to do is get in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| right place, and we think we've gotten a good spot to regulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Here is an example, if you haven't seen, of a listing on Airbnb, beautiful carriage house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| near UT in Market Square, $85 a night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| As you all know, there's this platform, and again, this isn't Airbnb specific, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| platform works in such a way that you can look and find the location, look and see who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| We're right now live on the website, and Chris is going to move that around so you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| an idea of where these are available right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=529)|
| 0:09:02| It takes a minute for them to pop up, but they're pretty well distributed all over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| city, obviously more so toward the center, but not exclusively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| At this point, I think it would be good to call briefly on Kim Bumpus to talk about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| this fits into the entire portfolio of the travel industry of people coming in to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and visit Knoxville's experience with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Kim Bumpus, President of Visit Knoxville, 301 South Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Basically, this is a travel trend, and it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| I mean, it's not going anywhere, and it's attracting a certain type of visitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| From a Visit Knoxville standpoint, obviously, I would love to see them regulated so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| be sure they're delivering on the visitor experience and also paying tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| I mean, it's already been proven that some of the clientele to the short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| are different than some of the folks that want to stay in hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| And, I mean, we're just seeing it boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| So, I mean, it's something that's here, and it's not going away, and that's kind of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| we're watching as Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| And obviously, hotel-motel tax is what funds us, so I'd love to see that as a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| vision, but the regulation and delivering on the visitor experience is important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| Kim, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Do you have any idea in terms of how much money we're talking about in terms of taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Well, I mean, with some of the numbers that are out there right now, obviously, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| they're not paying any taxes, as Visit Knoxville, we really haven't done a deep dive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| but we have looked on the website that was just up on the screen, and you can see there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| hundreds popping up, and there's more than just that website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| So, I mean, the numbers could be substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| And this is a growing trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| I mean, we're definitely not ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| I mean, this has been going on for a while, so we need to catch up with it because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| is a revenue stream, and our counterpoints in Memphis and Nashville and Chattanooga are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| already jumping on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| I'm sorry, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Go ahead, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Mr. Bumpus, if you could just, for the audience and for the audience on TV, just explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| the tax and the tax that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Definitely, hotel-motel tax, which is the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Which is at what rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| At 3% for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| And, well, if you're expanding on that, obviously, there's a 5% tax in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| But that tax is what goes into fueling your tourism efforts and marketing this destination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| so that we can bring bigger and better events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| And, you know, the whole short-term rental is very attractive to the international traveler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| as well that has an extended stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| So the amenities that sometimes are offered is appealing to them, and that's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| thing that as we grow the tax base, that's who we market to, and that's who we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| bringing to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I just want to, for clarity, there's no extra tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| It's what the tourism industry is already paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| 1,000%, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Okay, this is a good segue into our policy considerations because, and I'll start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| from what Kim was just speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Our main concern is equity and fairness in taxation between the hotel-motel industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| and the short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| We use that as a guiding principle, more so than revenue generation, though obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| that's a reality as Ms. Bumpus spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| So we ended up attacking this issue, and we did attack it, very much as we do others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| and we've brought to you other ordinances, food trucks being one that we spent an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| inordinate amount of time on as well, and I think we got it right through all the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| that we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| And that is to start off studying this intensively all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| The beautiful thing about these kinds of situations is we can learn a lot from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| experience of others, as I indicated before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| We also then received input from local, I would say, stakeholders, and we heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=790)|
| 0:13:19| people in neighborhoods as well as people in the short-term who are operating short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| We did so with overriding principles that we wanted to make very explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| The first was neighborhood preservation, that we started off very concerned and continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| to be concerned, and it's followed through, about the impact of houses coming off being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| full residences, either long-term rentals or owned, and being in a situation where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| were used as full-time opportunities for people to come and stay who did not live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| And we have many reasons to believe that can, and is shown in other cities, have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| deleterious impact on neighborhoods, on the fabric of the neighborhood, A, and also on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| availability of housing stock throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| And that is one of our second principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| We did not want to negatively impact the portfolio of rental homes, take them off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| increase competition for the available rental homes, force prices up, and exacerbate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| I wouldn't call an affordable housing crisis at this moment, but definitely an affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| housing challenge that we want to keep from becoming a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| And so we were very concerned about preservation of neighborhoods, about affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| We were also very concerned, on the other side, about preserving the ability of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| to participate in this phenomenon, which is a great income gap closer and can make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| difference in somebody being able to stay in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| And in this case, we're referring to the Type 1 or the owner-occupied situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| We have heard from many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| I have since run into many people who have contacted me who say, I live in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| I am, the ability to have part of my house participate in the short-term rental program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| has given me enough income to allow me to stay in this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| And that is making sure that income challenges are met, that people have the ability fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| to participate in that is something that was always a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Obviously, public safety goes along with neighborhood preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| We wanted to make sure nothing happens that causes one's life to be challenged by excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| police calls or any kind of issues like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Again, we haven't experienced anything like that, but that is obviously a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Economic equity, obviously, I just mentioned, between rentals and other lodging models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| such as hotels and bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| And I will say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| Everything we do, we don't have it explicitly up here, has an equity component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| And I think the equity can be approached in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| I mean, equity can be approached as equity among neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| We want to make sure that everybody is treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| If we thought that short-term rentals were damaging to any neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| we wouldn't recommend them at all if it's owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| We think the concern is the non-owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Also, equity in the ability of people to take advantage of the potential income stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| to let people in any neighborhood have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| That's something that overlies everything that we do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| A last consideration in any ordinance we present you that I think we need to make explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| during this discussion is we want to come up with something that's enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| realistically enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| That is, to have right now 8,000 operating sort of reminiscent of prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| Do we just pronounce that these are all operating outside of a legal authority right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| What position would you put people in and neighbors in if we had to try to enforce something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| that's this well engaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| That is something that is a consideration as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| because what we want to avoid from a good government perspective we all want to be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| is we don't want to have laws that we have out there that we know we can't effectively enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| That's not a good thing, something we always want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Lastly, and Jesse will speak a little more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| once all of this activity has gotten the attention of the Tennessee General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| we went to the very last day of the session lobbying very hard and effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| to have the legislature not preempt cities' ability to regulate short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| There were bills right to the last trying to say the big four cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| our authority to deal with this would be preempted and transferred over to the state legislative level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| We constantly have to be aware of that realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| and we'll speak more to the details of that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| But that is something that is a very real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| I will say at the beginning, though, even though that's been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| the ordinance we're recommending, as Krista will describe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| represents our best efforts at finding the best fit ordinance for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| independent of any considerations in the Tennessee General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| We did not write the ordinance to try to anticipate reaction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| But realistically, we have to recognize that there is a lot of oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| We are creatures of the state, and the state, many people in the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| are following what Knoxville does closely with an eye toward not having us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| with the predominant vision there being are we going to be overly restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| in something that's part of this new economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| So we can discuss that further in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| So what I want to do now is turn this over to Krista,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| who's going to describe the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| I guess before I do, Councilman Pavlis, Mayor Brown, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Dr. Lyons, I want to ask you about the bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| The map you showed with the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Does that include the bed and breakfast, or is that separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| What we showed was run through the Airbnb platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| and bed and breakfasts that have been operating operate independently of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| though I believe some are listed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| But they would be, probably would be included there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| but they're a somewhat separate entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| And are most of them owner-occupied, the bed and breakfasts I'm speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| What would you say? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Most of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| And they've been in existence much longer, I assume, than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Well, I vaguely remember the ordinance that established the capacity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| has been a number of years now, and they've been operating with no issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| In fact, some very positively in terms of reputation for the city, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Isn't that in certain zones, though, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Those are bed and breakfasts are in, what, H1s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Yeah, historic zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| I don't think we have that many bed and breakfasts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| that have gone through the process of getting approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Just quickly, I don't know who wants to address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| and it doesn't have to be done immediately, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| you mentioned one of the policy concerns was preservation of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| or neighborhood preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| We spend a lot of energy in this town developing watch groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| and neighborhood groups that keep an eye on what's happening in a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| and to neighbors' properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| And this new economy event you're talking about brings strangers into neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| and so the idea of the healthy, nosy neighbor saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| that car doesn't belong here, what's going on, sort of falls apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| And I'm just wondering how you deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| because now the idea that something different is happening in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| causes you to rethink how a neighborhood watch or how neighbors react to neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And you don't have to do that immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| but that is an aspect of neighborhood preservation that we're going to affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Let's wait until after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| I just want to make sure that's out on the floor that they understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Krista, I also wanted to say that a number of us have heard the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| at the different public meetings, so because of time, if you could hit the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| Yeah, I'll move through it really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| So as you know, as Bill said, we don't have a way of enabling these specifically right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| When we've had complaints, we've dealt with them mostly as motels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| which is a blunt tool at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| The ordinance is proposed to be under Chapter 16 of the City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| which is where our miscellaneous business licenses are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| That's where our food truck ordinance lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| And the reason for that is because there's a pretty extensive permitting process involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| so that's why we put it under that license section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Of course, we sent it to MPC out of an abundance of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| if this was interpreted as a zoning ordinance, and so that's why it went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| Private agreements, HOA, covenants, and rules are not part of what we would regulate under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| So if you have some sort of private covenant that restricts short-term rentals in, say, a condo downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| that is something that would be privately enforced by the HOA Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| We don't get involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| I just want to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| We're going to have a permitting system proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| There are two types of permits, and Bill mentioned these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| There's a Type 1 permit, and the cost for that is $70,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| and there's a Type 2 permit, and the cost for that is $120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| The thinking there being that if there was a need for business licenses in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| you have to get a city and a county business license at $15 each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| so that would make it kind of rounded up to either $100 or $150 for those permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1395)|
| 0:23:25| To kind of get into the meat of this, I think this is probably the issue that we'll spend a lot of time talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| and hearing about tonight, where can these be located and who can get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| So we have the Type 1 and the Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Type 1 permits are for residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| and the only people who are eligible to get those are the owners who live in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| That's kind of the owner-occupied requirement that we've been referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| So the person has to own the home, which is pretty easily evidenced by deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and they have to occupy the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| They have to live there on a full-time basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| It has to be their primary residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| And so we're going to be looking at specific documentation that the applicant provides on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Those documents are laid out in the ordinance, but an example might be a voter registration card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| So that's the residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Outside of the residential zones in the areas where dwellings are allowed, such as our C2 district downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1457)|
| 0:24:25| we have the Type 2 permit, and that is not restricted to people who live in the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| So you could be an owner or a lessee, or you could buy a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| and just rent it out on a short-term basis without living there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| And we're limiting that to two permits per permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| So that's basically the permit structure, where they can be located and who can get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| As far as safety requirements, we're doing an affidavit to ensure that there's the correct number of smoke alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| fire extinguishers, and carbon monoxide detectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| and the number of those just depends on the short-term rental size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| There's other information that we're going to be requiring as part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| There's a site plan showing parking, floor plan of the entire unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| proof of licenses as needed, the owner and lessee information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| an indemnification statement, the fees that they have to pay, and there's a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| The number of occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| So we looked at state law, and we looked at what other jurisdictions were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| and we came up with a maximum and kind of a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| So it's two people per bedroom with an additional two people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| contemplating maybe that people would sleep on the couch, something like that, in the living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| And there's a maximum of 12, and that comes from the state fire code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| So if you have a three-bedroom house, the maximum number of people who could be there for a short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| would be 3 times 2 plus 2, 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| So that's what we're looking at as far as the numbers per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| It's really based on the size of the unit and the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| So if you have a one-bedroom or a studio, you get only two people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| and then the two people in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| Taxes, this is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| There's a lot of different taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| I'm not going to run through all of them, but as has already been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| there's the hotel occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| There are gross receipts taxes and sales tax that may be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| based on the revenue generated by the short-term rental unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| Bill mentioned this. Enforcement is a huge, huge issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| and people often ask this question, how are we going to enforce this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| We tried to make it very simple on the front end for people to comply with this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| and I think that will help us get folks into the permitting system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| and encourage folks to comply with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| I think it's simple to understand. It's a very easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| But, of course, we will have violations, and how we deal with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| depends on whether those violations are someone operating without a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| or someone who already has a permit, and there's an issue that's arisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| So as far as unpermitted short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| we're looking at software to monitor who has a permit and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| So just like there were some pretty sophisticated folks out in San Francisco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| who developed Airbnb, along then came some other sophisticated folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| who mined the Internet for all the property tax information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| and they compared that to Airbnb listings. It's actually a pretty neat program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| So we're looking at getting that software, and I think it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| a really great tool. Nashville has, I think as of last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| they were signing the contract with one of these vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Asheville has been using one of these vendors for about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Chattanooga is looking at the same vendor that Nashville is using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| and one of the vendors that we've been in touch with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So we're really confident that this software will enable us to keep track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| of what's going on as far as unpermitted operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| For folks who already have a permit, we're going to be obviously relying on complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| when they come up, and we have a process laid out in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| of how to handle those complaints and how to revoke a permit if that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| So we've got it built in. I feel really confident that we can enforce this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| especially with the assistance of the software that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| How do you deal with the 300 or so that don't have permits right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Make them come in for your permit, or do they just thumb their nose at you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Well, that's where the software comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| So once we have the ordinance passed and we're able to employ that software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| they're going to be able to provide us with a report weekly of unpermitted operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| So they'll use our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| The codes will knock on their door or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| No, no one has to leave the building or go out to a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| It uses information available online, such as property tax records, all sorts of information, KGIS data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1759)|
| 0:29:28| and says, does this Airbnb listing, is it permitted in the city of Knoxville system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| And if it's not, we'll get a report of that, and then we have the capability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| depending on which level of services we employ in the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| of automatically generating a letter, notifying them that they're not in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| and then handling it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| So nobody has to leave the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| I think it's a great use of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Obviously, we don't have folks who can sit and scroll through 300 Airbnb listings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| so it's a really great tool for us to be able to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| I'm wondering if it's cheaper to pay the fine and rent the thing for $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Hi. Jesse Mayshore, communications director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Just to follow up on that question really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| one thing to keep in mind is that we have not to date created a way for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| who want a short-term rental permit to get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| We don't have such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| What we have heard and what you'll probably hear tonight from some people who are already doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| is that people want to be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| There are a lot of reasons for people to want to operate within the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| to not have to worry about a neighbor complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| and somebody showing up and having their guests thrown out on the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| We've heard that people want to pay occupancy taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| because, of course, they won't be paying the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Their guests will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| We think that those 200 to 300 listings, once we create a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| we will get a high degree of compliance right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| people coming in wanting to get the permit, wanting to be legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| and then the software Chris is talking about would enable us to then look for maybe the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| who are not being quite so proactive about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| I just wanted to put this map up here because I know I'm sure we'll be hearing some talk about R1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| and R1E districts and the possibility of maybe excluding them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| or prohibiting short-term rentals completely in those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| So I asked MPC to make a map showing what those districts are in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| which I think has been provided to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| If you look at that map, subtract out the commercial and industrial areas and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| you're probably looking there in the yellow areas, the R1, R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| at maybe two-thirds of the neighborhoods in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Definitely a majority of the neighborhoods in the city we would be effectively saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| this is a prohibited activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| You cannot do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Now, if you remember the map that we had up showing the current Airbnb site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| we have current listings all over that map, including all over all of those yellow areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| This is going on right now in all of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| It has been going on for, at a minimum, two or three years in all of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| It's been growing every year, but this has been going on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| And as Bill mentioned, in that time we have a literal handful of complaints of any issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| and most of those have just been because it's in illegal use right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| So we can talk more about the R1, R1E thing later if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| We think from a policy perspective that that is not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| We think it creates a whole realm of issues, even here locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| before we even get to talking about the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| And there's also just an issue that we don't â when something is new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| it's easy for people to be afraid of it, nervous about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| There are a lot of people in this city who are very comfortable with Airbnbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| people who already use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| There are a lot of people in this city who aren't, who have never used Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| who aren't familiar with it, and so it sounds scary to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| But this is happening right now. It's happening in all of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| It's happening in all of the areas that are shaded yellow up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| We are not getting phone calls about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| You can tell us if you are getting phone calls about it, about problems being created by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| But I just think it's always important to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Our approach here has been to try to recognize something that's already happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| and approach it and deal with it in a reasonable manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| based on the actual experiences that we're already having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| And so I just wanted to â because we spent a long time this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| fighting this issue in the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| We have had the pleasure in recent weeks of going and speaking to some neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| and getting a lot of heated rhetoric from people accusing us of undermining the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| of Knoxville neighborhoods with this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| And I want to tell you we spent months fighting for the integrity of Knoxville neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| fighting for local authority to make these decisions against a very well-organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2055)|
| 0:34:24| and well-funded lobbying effort by the short-term rental industry in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| that almost succeeded in superseding local authority over this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| first across the state, then they limited it to the big four cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| then the final version of it was limited just to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| and then finally they kind of postponed it to next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| But that bill is still very much alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| It is on the agenda of the Senate Finance Committee when they come back into session in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| It's sitting there waiting for their action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| And if you look at this coverage from the Tennessean after that bill finally died for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| you see a couple of comments there from legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| You have Steve Dickerson from Nashville who was the one who moved to delay it saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2108)|
| 0:35:15| I would just caution all local authorities that they need to be very even-handed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| in their regulation of this very important subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And then you have one of the House sponsors of the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| the one who actually proposed to exempt everybody but Nashville from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| He said he amended the bill to only focus on Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| because the other three big cities in Tennessee, Knoxville, Memphis, and Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| are, quote, doing it right, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| The bill that he was looking at for Knoxville was our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| which we provided to our lobbyists and we provided to legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| We have had generally favorable response from legislators about the approach that we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Now, as Bill said, that's not our only consideration in crafting a local ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| but this is the reality, and the bill that they are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| would not only allow owner-occupied short-term rentals in all residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| of whatever cities they decide to apply it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| they would also allow unlimited non-owner-occupied short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| which are the ones that we do have a lot of concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| in terms of their impacts on our neighborhoods and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| So, as Bill said, as we consider this for our own purposes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| that is also the reality that we're facing at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Bill, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| No, I think we want to be respectful of your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| and I know there's going to be some real desire to have Q&A among council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| and between council and us, and then to hear from folks who are here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Okay, well, we'll go ahead and open it up for the questions and answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Council, any questions for the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Mr. Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I'm not sure who's best to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Can you talk about the grandfathering issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Both, are the current operators grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| and if we do pass an ordinance, are the people that get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| would that use be grandfathered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| If for some reason we pass the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| and then felt that it was a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| could we take those permits away from the people that obtained them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| Sure, I'll answer them in the order that you asked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| As far as grandfathering the ones that are operating now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| those are essentially illegal uses in the majority of the districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| where they are operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| You don't get any grandfathering rights in an illegal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| So anyone who's operating now would not necessarily be able to continue that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| Obviously, in the commercial districts like C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| there's an opportunity for a Type 2 permit under the new ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| but in the residential districts, that may not be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| depending on how that short-term rental is operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| So there is no grandfathering rights as far as existing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| As for the permits that would be issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| because it's a permit, the person who obtains that permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| is only vested in that permit for the term of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| It's an annual permit, and so they have to renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| At the end of that year, if we decided to change things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| they would not be able to renew the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| We do have a vesting clause in the ordinance that explains that a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| and makes it very clear that we have that opportunity to change the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| if we desire to in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you. Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| On that same note, as far as grandfathering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| we've got documented 8,000 visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| We've got people out there that obviously have repeat customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| It just seems like when you say they're illegal and they can't be grandfathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2351)|
| 0:39:21| how did we deal with mobile homes back in the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| In the 70s, we had mobile homes in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| and I don't think we can have mobile homes in the city, but they're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| I'm trying to wrap my head around why we wouldn't want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| It's my intent to grandfather them, to get them to where they still operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| I just think that that's why do we want to be prohibitive of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| who have made huge investments in our city and are paying tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| and want to be participating in the hotel tax and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| Help me get my head around why we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| First of all, per Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and we just had a phone conversation with representatives from Airbnb last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| they told us that most of the existing listings in our city are owner-occupied listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| So anyone who's already operating an owner-occupied listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| where they're renting out an upstairs apartment or their carriage house or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| those would obviously be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| You talk about 200 to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Airbnb says the majority of those are owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| so the majority of them will be able to get a permit and continue operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| If you're talking about non-owner-occupied properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| then that gets into all the concerns that Bill talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| which is property being removed from the housing market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and turned into functionally a non-residential use in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| You are then talking about a full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| If you have an owner-occupied situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| the primary use of that property is still residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| It's a place where somebody lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| and the short-term rental is basically an auxiliary use to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| The non-owner-occupied use is a 100% full-time commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| and so that also gets into questions about allowing full-time commercial uses in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| In terms of people who have made investments, this was not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| Anybody who bought a house intending to use it as a full-time short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| had no reasonable legal or other expectation that they would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| It's not a permitted use in that district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| any more than if you bought a house intending to use it as a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| So there is no vested right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Of course, what they still have is the asset of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| They can live in it. They can rent it to long-term renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| They can use it for residential use as it was zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| I think that's our concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| I like the statement Dr. Lyons made about being even-handed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| If it is such a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| then it seems like we would want to be receptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| and try to create an environment to where they could continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| as long as they own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| You know, maybe perhaps once the property was sold or whatever, then it reverts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| But I think, and it's going to be my intent, is to try to find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I mean, I talked with Dr. Lyons months ago about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and never had any further discussion that I had serious concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| about people who had already invested in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| So I don't want to see where we just slam the door on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| and tell them they can't operate, because they are operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Admittedly, by you all, what you're saying this evening, we hadn't had complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| I mean, even if folks live in Nashville or wherever they live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| I mean, if we're not having complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| it just seems like we want to be a little bit more open to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| and not draw the attention of the fine folks in Nashville and our General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| And, you know, if it's such a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| then I don't think that it really should be that big of a task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| to find a way for them, as long as they own that property, to continue to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| And I didn't have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Are you talking about they'd still go through the permitting process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Oh, yeah. They have to become legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| They have to come in and do what everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I'm not saying segregate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| You're saying they can have two or three of them when there's only one allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I don't see how you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| You're saying they can have two or three because they've already invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| instead of the one that's allowed under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, they don't have any special rights by taking a risk and violating the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| that now they've got a preference to keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I mean, this is a system designed to have owner-occupied rentals in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| that has that overview of you're going into someone's home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| if your mama raised you right, you're not going to mess up their home or their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| and it's going to be a system that's enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| They're being asked to apply for a permit, but if they've got three houses they've fixed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| they ain't getting three permits under this rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| and being nice to them because they spent money I don't think is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| That sort of encourages people to violate the law and race in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| That's crazy. I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Well, I don't know about being crazy, but I think it's just saying that we need to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| So how many have three, own three properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| They know better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| We've had people at public meetings that said, I've got four houses and I want to keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| And what I've said is we need to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| I don't have a solution on paper tonight, but I think it's something that we need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| and see if we can work with the folks who have invested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| rather than just shut the door on them and say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| I think Jesse said it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| They've got the value in the house and they can sell it or rent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| You calling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Oh, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| I've got a Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Krista, you said earlier about we talked about the comparison of bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| and you said, if I understood it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| very few people actually went through the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| So we have an ordinance that specifies what you have to do to get a bed and breakfast approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| It has to be, first of all, located in a historic overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| which obviously narrows that significantly where those could be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| And then you have to go through an approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| I think it's a use on review in some of our residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| So I didn't mean to imply that we have bed and breakfast operating willy-nilly outside the perimeters of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| I think we just don't have a lot of them, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| I know there's one on Glenwood, Marble Hill Inn, I think is what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| And they list on Airbnb, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| But they went through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| They got a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| They got all their approvals and they are an approved bed and breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| But they also list on Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| So how do you think that, and I don't know, but you made the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| So how do you think that short-term rentals, the enforcement of short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| and the permitting will be any different for a short-term rental than it's been with our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| you stated, that we have on bed and breakfast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| When the numbers are far greater, or the numbers that are existing are far greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| Why would we treat them differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Why do you think that the regulation will be any different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| or any easier to regulate more short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| than we're not able to regulate bed and breakfasts that are operating without a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| We do regulate bed and breakfasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Are they permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| You said many of them weren't permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| I thought that's what you said, so I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| I don't know whether they are or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| We don't have many of them, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| You're just saying we don't have many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Therefore, there haven't been many of them permitted is what I was trying to convey there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| As far as short-term rentals, I think just by comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| we're seeing a lot more demand for short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| which I think merits a different way of regulating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| So why are we looking at short-term rentals different than bed and breakfast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| Why are we going and saying that this is different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| I wasn't here when the bed and breakfast ordinance was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| but I think that that was a pretty long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| and there was a lot of public input that resulted in the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| I think they operate differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| I think bed and breakfasts are really intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| You have the person on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| There's the expectation of a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| It's a totally different operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| and I think it's recognized by the way it's structured in our zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| as a quasi-commercial operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| We have acknowledged that these owner-occupied short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| are basically an extension of the residential use that's already allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| So I think they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I think, if I could add, the host plays a much greater role in the bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| much more active than most short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| There really are different animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| and much more intensive use that you would expect with a bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| and we think that the short-term rental phenomenon has kind of rolled past that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| and the numbers have kind of shown the much more interest of visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| in that less intensive experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Well, our definitions would not indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| I mean, I think our definitions say that it's a private residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| located in a historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| where the resident owner offers lodging to transient guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| So, I mean, we have the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| We have rules of how it's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| It goes on to say where breakfast is the only meal offered to a guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| and the number of people and how you get the permit and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I mean, it seems like to me we have an ordinance that's there for this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| It's structured, it's defined, and it's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| And I guess that's one of my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| I think it's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| and we could regulate it based on what we already have, it seems like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| But, I mean, also, I guess my second comment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| we have engaged a company to overhaul our zoning code right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| and we're in the process of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and whatever, we're 18 months or so away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| How will, if this ordinance passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| how will that affect the new zoning code that's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| or how will the new zoning code affect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| I mean, is this a stopgap measure for the next two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| before we overhaul our new zoning code, or how's that going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Because of where it's located in the code, being in Chapter 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| it won't really be affected by that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| So we do have the definitions in the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| residential uses, non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Depending on how the consultant configures our new zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| and how they're titled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| we may need to tweak that definition slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| But that's the only thing I could foresee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I think putting it in Chapter 16 really gives us the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| to change this as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Which says that it's not really a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| it's just more of a use, permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| It's a permitted use, and hence you don't get into all the best thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| you know, pre-existing, non-conforming, and all the kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| that you can when you start getting into other areas of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Krista, I have a question, and try to clarify this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| For the bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| they are only allowed in residential with a historic overlay, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| So what would be the problem with allowing Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| or short-term rentals only in certain zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| I'll let one of these folks answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| I mean, I know you, Jesse, I know you showed the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| We think that that is an unrealistic approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| These are not allowed right now, and we have 300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| and we probably have 100 more than we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| They're just as illegal now as they were a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| and we're up by 100 from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| So just because they're illegal, we're going to make them legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| No, it's because it's a very important existing phenomenon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I think to the bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| there was always the nature of that use limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| to a handful of operations with a different character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| I think the whole character, what implied by a bed and breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| is something you think of more in historic zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| but this now represents a fundamental change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| in the way people are traveling and staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| and part of the sharing economy that didn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| and it exists in much greater numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| So we believe, given where they exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| and everything else associated with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| that limiting them, there isn't a real rational basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| for limiting them that we could apply here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| that would be equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| And also, do we consider short-term rentals a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3201)|
| 0:53:29| Somebody would be operating that out of their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| as they do some other enterprises such as that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| But the primary use of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| would still be somebody's residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| but it would be a business activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| So does this open the door for other business activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| in the residential zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Well, it only opens the door to the degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| that somebody could be persuasive about allowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| and allow a whole new ordinance to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| and I would certainly have confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| that council would use this good judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| to recognize what would be appropriate and not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| I mean, there are any number of, and even now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| there are some uses that are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| that council has deemed appropriate before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| So I don't think, it doesn't necessarily open any door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Obviously, there's a logic to it that others could try to bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| but I think that would be a difficult sell in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| And also, I just want to go back to the question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| well, why do we, just because it's illegal, do we allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Obviously not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| There are any number of illegal activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| that happen in the city every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| and we do not legalize them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| just because people are doing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| This is a relatively new phenomenon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| of the quote-unquote sharing economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| that we have had the opportunity now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| to see in operation in our city and in cities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| It has obvious benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| As Kim Bumpus said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| it is a small but growing part of the hospitality industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| It is something that a growing number of people turn to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| when they're making a visit somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| so it can provide a good guest experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| If they are permitted and taxed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| then you get the benefit of the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| You get the economic benefit of encouraging visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| So it's something that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| We know it's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| There are positive benefits to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| And so then what do you balance that against is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| well, what are the negative impacts of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| We don't believe that owner-occupied short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| in residential neighborhoods have negative benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| We think that is demonstrated every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| It's being demonstrated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| There are people in Knoxville tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| staying in all of these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| and you won't get phone calls about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| and we won't get phone calls about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| We don't think it has that kind of negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| And as Bill said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| if we thought it had a negative impact on neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| we live in Knoxville neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| I live in Oakwood Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| one of the neighborhoods that, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| if you exempt R1 and R1E, Oakwood Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| most of it is R2, it would still be fair game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| And if you think that there's a negative impact to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| then I guess my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| why do you want to permit it in my neighborhood and not in yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| We don't think that there's a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Thanks, Mr. Delahill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Just wondering, if we've got a football weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| and I can stick eight people in the house if I've got three rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| I think Chris has said six plus two extras or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| what keeps a bold entrepreneur from saying I'll rent it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| and tough noogies, if you want to cite me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| I'll pay the $50 fine and I'll pocket the $600 I just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| I mean, how do you really regulate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Well, there's no change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| That can happen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| I'm just saying, how do you deal with that in this future world you envision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| Well, again, there are responsibilities on the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| And so if there were behavior and complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| and Tamsi would certainly let us know if there was a wild party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| and such associated with that, then that permit would be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| and they'd be back to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| And as you know, any number of people, regardless of this whole enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| have parties and have things that happen in their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| and people call the police and deal with noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| There is nothing about creating this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| and putting it into the legal realm that should do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| to increase the number of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| And if people didn't obey the permit requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| there are ways to deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Does Airbnb do anything to inform you that I've got someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| with three different permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| or is that something the software deals with on your end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| and you don't deal with Airbnb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| In other words, do they help enforce or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| What do they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| I think the software would capture that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| And to your question about people exceeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| the Airbnb listings show you the number of guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| that can be accommodated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| and that's information that the software would capture as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| So, for example, on this listing that I have pulled up on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| it shows here eight guests, and this has three bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| so this would be in compliance with what's proposed as far as the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| We can look at downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| This looks like a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| It has two guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| So we have the information available through the platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| to be able to know what they're typically listing as far as the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| So that's a way for us to capture that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Yeah, Krista, does that platform also cover the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| the VRBO, the Flipkey, the whatever other platforms there are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| The software looks at all of those platforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| the most popular ones, which you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Dr. Lyons, we've heard about the four major cities in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Have you all looked at the research on a national level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| of how this affects various cities, pro and con,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| are there major problems or non-problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| But what have you learned on a national level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Well, Mayor Brown, we look extensively at a number of cities in the region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| and nationally, and I think there have been some situations that have turned out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| to convince us that going down certain roads would be ill-advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| Many of the worst issues that are in more of the tourist-intensive cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| I say take New Orleans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| where there are people who are buying up blocks of property in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| and that has real obvious negative impacts on the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| to turn them over to this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| We also know that when cities try to get too complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| and make the rules rather Byzantine that they're very hard to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| and have led to lots of pushback and lots of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Nashville is trying to deal with a lot of complications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| from some certain limits they tried to put on non-owner-occupied in different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| And we've found other cities where things seem to be working quite well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| and mostly the problems, I would let Jesse or Chris to add on to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| but when there have been problems, they've been in the non-owner-occupied variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| and that has alerted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| It's much more unusual to have them in the owner-occupied situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| Do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Two things I'd like to say is we have a number of people who have signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| and as I said in the very beginning that we realize you all have taken your time to come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| and we do want to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I am going to limit the amount of time for each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| However, what we would like is if someone has already voiced the opinion that you agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| we would appreciate it if we keep that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| We have 19 people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| We have three for and 16 against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| So we would like for you to think of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| but I will limit you to no more than three minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Before we start, I do want to say that we have a Boy Scout here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| who's working on a merit badge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| and part of what he has to do is to learn about how his community works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| and how government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| So, Robert Mann, you're out there someplace, I think, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| So, Robert, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| He made a run for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| He may have run for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| His mom came with him, and so maybe they saw how government works and did take off on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| or especially before the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| So in order to get started, we're going to start with the four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| and first up is Jonathan Weasley-Higgle speaking for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| If you'll state your name and address, and you have three minutes starting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| I'm Jonathan Weasley-Higgle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I live at 726 Deary Street in the Forth and Gill community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| I own, along with my beautiful wife, an Airbnb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| and one that is owner-occupied and one that is non-owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| It is over off of Martin Luther King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| The first, I think, that is most important to say is that we agree with a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| what has been put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| We want to be regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| We think that it brings quality to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| You can see I'm reading out of my guest book that has been filled for the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| of stories of people that have traveled into Knoxville and saw it as a drive-through town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| but since staying with us, they wanted to stay longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| They wanted to enjoy Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| They wanted to enjoy the brewery scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| They wanted to enjoy everything that Knoxville had to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| We love being hosts, and we want to continue that in a legal fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| Actually, that was us they pulled up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| A little advertisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| I was hoping for a booking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Both of our houses are actually booked tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| We're very excited about our guest tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| As this continues, I would ask for a reconsideration on the non-owner occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| I think there is room with a Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| We would love to play additional if that is there or at least grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| It is an investment that we love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| We love the house, and we don't want to really see it go or to try to have some sort of workaround within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3818)|
| 1:03:46| We want to operate legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| We want to operate professionally as people enjoy our fine city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| There are even reviews within us that say that it is our passion for the city that has made us want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3832)|
| 1:04:01| Thank you for your time, and thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| My wife and I are very proud of three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| We're talking over 400 reservations and not a single customer complaint from a neighbor in either property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| Thank you, Jonathan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Mike Cohen, state your name and address, and your three minutes have begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| Thank you, Councilman. Thank you, all members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| I'm Mike Cohen, 5523 Parkdale Road in the heart of the Fightin' Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| I want to thank Council. I want to thank the city for working on an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| and I think they've given something and taken something from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| So I think they've struck a good balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| I want Council to know I operate an Airbnb, and I've had hundreds of guests over a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| I've had guests from Seattle, Miami, Boston, New York, L.A., Memphis, Nashville, London three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| They keep coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| France, Canada, Jordan, Bulgaria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| So it really is people from all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| I find that people leave reviews, and you have to leave reviews for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| That's a critical part of how Airbnb is self-regulated is through reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| If you get bad reviews, you're not going to get business, and here's how reviews work on Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| The day your guest checks out, you get a notice saying fill out an online review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| and you have to rate people and everything else, and they get one to rate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| You can't edit the review after you submit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| and it doesn't show up until you've both submitted your reviews or 14 days pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| So those reviews are really critical, and that's one of the reasons I think you're going to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3947)|
| 1:05:52| that most people that operate an Airbnb are going to be really responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| Also, at least for my guests, and I think Jonathan and Lacey would back me up on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| and all the other Airbnb operators here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| people are so respectful of the fact that they are in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| I mean, most of my guests, they don't just run the dishwasher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| They strip the beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| They pile all the towels in the laundry room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| They realize they're in your home, and they're really respectful and kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| and I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I know people that have issues with R1 and R1E are worried that we represent change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| The fact of the matter is we don't represent change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| We're already in those neighborhoods, and as the city has told you, there isn't a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| If there is an occasional problem, I would point out to you that the city police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| has in the last couple of years on at least a couple of occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| raided and shut down motels that were nuisances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| where there were drugs or prostitution and ongoing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| Nobody then suggested that you eliminate all motels because one or two were a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| So it's the same with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Even if you end up having a problem with an Airbnb, which I doubt you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| or with other short-term rentals, I would encourage you to allow them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| We're good for neighborhoods, not bad for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| And finally, why do people use Airbnbs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| I found a study by Consumer Reports that said 37% of the people that have used home sharing rated it good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4032)|
| 1:07:20| Fifty-three percent said it was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Even Consumer Reports says that's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| The reasons why people use alternative to hotel experiences, save money 70%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| have unique accommodations 58%, and the availability of a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4056)|
| 1:07:44| Mike O'Heron, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4064)|
| 1:07:54| But you're for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Oh, that was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| I'm actually against it because my name is Mike O'Heron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Address is 4943 Riverside Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| I'm for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Oh, you're for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| I was kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| For or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| I'm saying I should be against it because I actually live in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| And if it's not happening up here, that will just improve our bookings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| We've only been doing it about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| We've got 76 reviews, none less than five stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| The people that have come to our place have been, without exception, great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| It's been the best experience of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| And we've had people come to our place because of our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| So there are people coming to Knoxville because we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| There was a couple that stayed with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| They were in town for some other function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| They loved it so much they went back to Golden, Colorado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| They told their friends about their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Their friends decided to come here for their wedding anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| So there are, one time, people coming to Knoxville just because of Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4142)|
| 1:09:11| I don't think you'll find any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| We haven't so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| So there's no reasonable expectation that suddenly there are going to start being problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| when there haven't been any and the clientele is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| Those speaking against, we'll start with Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Is Mary here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4175)|
| 1:09:44| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| I live in the Lion's View community neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| I want to start by saying that I think, in general, the sharing economy is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| However, I think we also have to be mindful when we bring it into a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| that we are not just talking about a transaction of happy host and happy guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| We have other people who are affected, if only because the neighborhood is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| if there is a business operation going on in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| Now, you may or may not hear complaints from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| but I think that we are on the cusp, inevitably, of a great deal of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| And because of that, it's really important to think very carefully about how to structure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| So I think the ordinance is a very important, proactive, needed movement in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4238)|
| 1:10:47| but I do think it needs some corrective measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| One is that I think that, and I'm mainly going to address short-term rentals in residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4250)|
| 1:11:02| We refer to the owner and owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| but be mindful of the fact that the owner doesn't have to actually be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| And I would argue that the owners should be required to be in residence when there is a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4272)|
| 1:11:23| And I argue that for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| One is that if neighbors are disturbed by a short-term renter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| then they should be able to go directly to the person they know, the owner, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Hey, Bob, I can't deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| And they should not have to hunt up Bob's local contact person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| Second, if the actual owner is there, other than a remote local contact person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| the users of the short-term renters are going to probably be more respectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| not just of the property, but of the neighborhood in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| The other thing to be mindful of is that owner-occupied or principal residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| simply means that that person has to be there at least six months out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| So for much of the year, five months and 29 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| they could be someplace else and they could be operating a short-term rental operation out for their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4346)|
| 1:12:35| 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Okay. So those are my main points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| But I also want to say that living in a fragile neighborhood that is zoned R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| we could easily tip into R2 if there is pressure to exclude R1 from this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Debra Olson. Is Debra here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| Ms. Olson, state your name and address, and you have three minutes starting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| Hi. I'm Debra Olson. I live at 6700 East Dick Ford Lane in Knoxville, in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| I actually am for short-term rentals, but I am against some things that are in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| and that's what I'm coming to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| I currently own five long-term rentals in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| and one short-term rental in the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| Three of my long terms are on Section 8 housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| So why do I choose to list 50% of my property on low-income housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| Because that's my choice. That's my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| This is my property that I have purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Now you're trying to tell me that I cannot operate a short-term rental on that same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| I can only operate a long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| So now you're taking away the choice that I have of which way to operate that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4435)|
| 1:14:03| Knoxville has missed several big opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| with bringing in big opportunities with a semi-pro baseball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| and other things trying to catch up to Chattanooga's waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| What I'm looking for now is for Knoxville to step up and lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Let's implement a plan that works for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| This isn't someone winning. This is compromising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| and that's what we're trying to look for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| I'm great with the rules and the laws in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| but the one issue I have is with the Type 1, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| One-owner occupant license, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Type 2, allowing two non-owner occupant licenses, that's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| I think that there should be a set number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I think that three keeps it mom and pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| They can run a small short-term rental on the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| to help offset some of the costs from the long-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| But what I have an issue with is trying to tell me that I can't have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| in an area that I can't operate a long-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| So what I propose is to keep this, but allow them to operate in any zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| I can do that with a long-term rental as it stands right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| but I can't a short-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| And as they said, if you shut down R1 zones right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| it will take two-thirds of the residential districts away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| That is a lot of Airbnbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| What I do propose is to let the HOAs regulate their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| We are already allowed to have the long-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| so let's stop over-governing people, let them govern themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| If that doesn't work, revisit this in two to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| The problem is no one knows what to do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| or what to expect from this new free market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| Well, before we squash that free enterprise, why don't we give it a chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| This gives families a way to stay together and experience our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| I meet a lot of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| They love being in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| They want to experience Knoxville in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| So what I propose is that, to just allow it in any zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| and then any residential area and allow those areas to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Allow the HOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| If they don't like it, then create it so they won't have them anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4569)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, Debra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Carleen, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4587)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Carleen Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| Speaking on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| I'm going to talk in part about the R1E thing, as Mr. Mayshark referred to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| Please be aware of the fact we're not afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| This is not about fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| This is about what the zoning ordinance says and what people expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| First of all, I submitted comments on there are problems with, I believe, the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| I submitted those comments in writing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I will not discuss them in my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| We ask that the zoning ordinance, that the zoning districts R1 and R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| be removed from the list of districts that allow short-term rentals of any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| R1 and R1E are not appropriate districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| They are older suburban neighborhoods located farther from the core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| These two residential zoning districts are the only residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| that do not allow either apartments or bed and breakfasts or rooming and boarding houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| Likewise, a similar use to those three uses, short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| should not be allowed in these zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| When you speak about equity, it's an interesting subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Everyone should have the right to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Our zoning ordinance says otherwise as to how you use your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| I can't have a restaurant in my house even though I have a kitchen and I can cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| My husband can't work on cars in the garage for other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| which is a good thing because he's not good at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| So we're all safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| But there are distinctions made between the different zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| in the ordinances of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| I think visitors should have a choice when they come to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| Stay in suburban motels, urban hotels, five-star, no-star, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| including bed and breakfasts, including short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| But I think the people who live here every day and go home every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and pay their taxes and raise their kids and are members of neighborhood watches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| and maintain their yards and are not living in zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| that allow apartments, that allow parking lots, that allow all kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| have the right to continue to go home to their neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| as they know it with the character that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| And keep in mind, R1 and R1E are two of the original zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| in the original zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| They do not have the protections that the newer zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| like E and 1, Planned Residential, have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| They don't have HOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| They don't have those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| The only thing that protects them are the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Thank you, Carlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Larry Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Larry, if you will state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| And you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| My remarks today are on behalf of Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| an organization founded in 1985 with representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| from many city and county neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Since its inception, the members of Community Forum have focused their attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| on working to protect and strengthen their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| We have worked on many planning and zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| and have frequently provided our input on proposed ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| to MPC, City Council, and County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Our participation in issues such as the one before you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| has made a big difference in improving ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| so that uses allowed in our neighborhoods are consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| with the character and integrity of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| We are advocates for neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| and particularly for people whose home is often their biggest investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| most prized possession, and valuable asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| often located in R1 and R1E neighborhoods located throughout the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| and often what is considered the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| These homes, in many instances, were built many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| in some of Knoxville's oldest, largest, and most established and stable neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| such as Sequoia Hills, West Hills, Fountain City, and Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| People purchased and improved, and often increased their investment in their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| based on an understanding of the rules governing R1 and R1E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| and with the understanding and reasonable belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| that these rules would not ever dramatically change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Neighborhood groups and individuals have invested much time and money over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| to protect their neighborhoods from attempts to change the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| and integrity of their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Even though the city is not amending the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| this is really an important zoning issue to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| whose lives may be impacted by this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Our zoning ordinance contains a wide variety of restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| regarding what developments are allowed or prohibited in our many zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| Certain entities are allowed in some areas and not in others, and for many good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| Community Forum and its members, along with other groups and individuals in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| have recently communicated with City Council about our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| about allowing short-term rentals in R1 and R1E neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| We have detailed many reasons why short-term rentals are not appropriate for these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Requiring short-term rentals to be owner-occupied does not provide adequate protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| for R1 and R1E districts, especially when the owner does not have to be staying on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| or even be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| An owner-occupied requirement does not address our many concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| regarding safety, noise, and parking arising from short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| in close proximity to our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| We are very concerned that there is not a realistic enforcement plan contained in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| We want to make clear that we are not advocating a total prohibition of short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| They do not belong in R1 and R1E districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| which under our zoning ordinance do not allow similar uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| such as the bed and breakfast room in boarding houses and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| This ordinance would set a bad precedent for allowing other inappropriate uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| in R1 and R1E zoning districts and would create much uncertainty for property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| who would worry that a short-term rental could negatively impact their future enjoyment of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| Thank you for your consideration of our position on this issue of great importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| to our R1 and R1E neighborhoods. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Sandy Gillespie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| State your name and address. You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Sandy Gillespie, 4272 Holloway Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| I'm speaking against including R1 and R1E neighborhoods in the proposed short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| This is not an Airbnb ordinance. It's a short-term rental ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| The main difference between a short-term rental and a long-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| is not the commerce involved but the transient nature of the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| A long-term tenant is, for all intents and purposes, your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| By definition, they have a vested interest in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| that is exponentially higher than a short-term renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| Long-term tenants are not here to crash or to attend a specific event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5022)|
| 1:23:49| Their kids attend school, they participate in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| and they interact with their community through a prism of a much larger time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| and short their residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| They, along with their neighbors, help us put the R in R1 and R1E zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| Short-term tenants are not residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| so zoning is the logical place to address whether they should be allowed in R1 and R1E neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5049)|
| 1:24:17| Short-term rentals, as you've heard, are not allowed in apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| Bed and breakfast and rooming and boarding are not currently permitted in R1 and R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| Enforcement of the ordinance will be difficult, particularly with the maximum of 12 capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| Finally, neighborhood community policing strongly encourages neighborhood watch programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| to get to know neighbors and look out for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| How much more difficult could this become with the possibility of mini-sized hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| or motels operating in our R1 and R1E neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| Thank you, Sandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| Again, I want to reiterate that if things have already been said that you want to just say you agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| we would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| But, again, we are going to listen to everyone that has signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Ann McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| Ann, if you would state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| I am McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| I live at 4211 Tallaluna Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| And I have another way of saying a couple of things you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| And before I do that, I've written it down so I can go fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| Parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| It got said just in passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Parking is very important, and it must accommodate the number of people that could be accommodated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| in the wherever, whatever zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| When people live in a circumscribed area for a while, more than just a few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| they become known to others living there, and they come to know the others living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| This is the fundamental component of a sense of community, a sense of belongingness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| This allows acceptance of mutual responsibility, of behaving in ways that are consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5168)|
| 1:26:16| with the standards of co-residence in the shared community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| These standards exceed the minimums required by law most of the time, or many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| And they include things like bothering with public niceties that make it a better neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| Things are very obvious, like keeping your lawn as neat as other people's around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| because they know you, and they're going to raise an eyebrow if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| And you want to belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| I want to just give you an example of being known in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| and with some respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| This last winter, I had a new knee installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| I didn't ask, but my neighbors started bringing my newspaper in, bringing my mail in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5226)|
| 1:27:15| and putting it by the door when I couldn't go out because I couldn't get down the stairs in a walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| We have neighbors with a new baby, and they told me that several people have called and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| can I grocery shop for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| They do this because they know each other, they know what's going on, and they care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| And that requires stable residence in a circumscribed community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5257)|
| 1:27:46| I'm not against turnover in a community that already has a commercial element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| I am concerned any place that there be enough parking space of the type that is required in our codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5272)|
| 1:28:02| so that it isn't a nuisance in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5286)|

| 1:28:22| Larry Deering, 200 at Air Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| First, I'd like to address a few things that have been said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| one of which is that Chattanooga, among others, is doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Well, Chattanooga has restricted the use of STRs to a small geographic area around the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| That's doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Now, the fact that short-term rentals are taking place now in R1E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| and should therefore be continued into the future is faulty logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| Around the turn of the 19th century, duals were common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| They were outlawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Just because it's being done doesn't mean it should continue to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| And I've heard it said repeatedly that problems have not been reported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| therefore there are no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Well, if my next-door neighbor rents out a room to Vol fans over a weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| and Tennessee wins the game at 11 o'clock at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| a car full of people come up, the horns honking, people yelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Go Vols!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| Am I going to call the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| I'm going to try to go back to sleep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| and I don't want to start a feud with my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| That doesn't mean I don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Andrew Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| Is Andrew here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| David Gardner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| You're not speaking. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Luke Gustafson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Did I say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| So I'm in the little bit awkward position that I am supportive of short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| I misunderstood the question that I don't support the ordinance as it's drafted currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| but I'm in support of short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| My name is Luke Gustafson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| I live at 1003 West Greenwood Avenue in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| I own and operate two short-term rentals here in Knoxville just off of UT's campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| To try to not say too much of what other people have already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| I do want to say that I want to preface everything I say that I unequivocally am not opposed to some sort of regulation of short-term rentals and regulatory oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5429)|
| 1:30:39| I completely understand that there can be issues that come with running short-term that could warrant landlord registration and life and safety oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| However, I believe the ordinance as drafted is overly and unnecessarily broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| Ultimately, what it comes down to, in my opinion, is the banning of non-owner-occupied in residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5453)|
| 1:31:02| I think what we've heard a lot tonight is that this is currently not allowed because it's a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| I think that that's what's predicated upon when that statement's being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| I think that's misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| As an example, I use Airbnb very frequently with my family to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Airbnb is the anti-hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| We don't use Airbnb the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| We want to use it as our home when we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| We reside in that residence while we're in that Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| I feel like it's just a misunderstood use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| These are not many hotels that I keep hearing so frequently being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| All that to be said, I encourage you to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| If you're unwilling to reconsider banning non-owner-occupied units in residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5517)|
| 1:32:06| I hope that you at least consider grandfathering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| When the legislature gave the cities the right to have zoning back in the 40s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| they specifically put in the legislation, in the law, that the cities had to grandfather in any use of a property that was being used that way prior to the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5537)|
| 1:32:28| I would hope that you would at least consider grandfathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| Carol, if you'll state your name and address, you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| I am Carol Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| I live at 1101 Craig Road in the city of Knoxville for over 30 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| That's the Forest Brook area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| And I'll be reading this so I won't forget anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| For more than half a century, the R1 zoning district in Knoxville has been identified and protected as the place for single-family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| and underlying single-family residences in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Two years ago, this city council refused to allow planned residential zoning to allow seven single-family structures on the Christenbury property on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5590)|
| 1:33:20| That, despite the presence of several multifamily properties on Kingston Pike within two blocks of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| Your reasoning on that decision was that that area of Kingston Pike, part of the Sequoia Hills neighborhood, should remain sacrosanct as a single-family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| Several years ago, you refused to allow a bed and breakfast in a single-family house on Kingston Pike, nor site in the Sequoia area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| Same argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| What has changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| How many of you expect to have short-term rentals at the houses in your neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| Our neighborhood has no sidewalks, three significant curves, and my street has regular cut-through traffic between Westland Drive and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5630)|
| 1:33:59| Though there are moms pushing their babies in strollers, neighbors walking their dogs, runners, and regular walkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| What is your estimate for additional traffic that would be generated by four, six, eight, ten, twelve additional people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| and perhaps that many additional cars, whether their own, cabs, Uber, or other people picking up the short-term residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| I'm asking for consideration of the long-term residents who are paying the taxes, playing by the rules, including the zoning rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| and ask that our investment in our homes be respected without injecting an idea that has not been proven to be of value to the neighborhoods like ours or yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5667)|
| 1:34:36| The implication of this proposal is that there are not sufficient spaces for people to stay in not-so-short-term periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| There are. They are called hotels and motels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| The city has continued to encourage and support new hotels which are located in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| I ask that you vote against this ill-conceived, disruptive amendment of the R1 compact that this city has maintained with single-family residents for more than half a century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5692)|
| 1:35:03| And I'm also concerned, it seems like some of you were more concerned about the investments of the people who have been operating these illegally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5703)|
| 1:35:11| than the investments of us that have lived in our homes for decades. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| Natalie Nordstrom. State your name and address, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5722)|
| 1:35:29| Natalie Nordstrom. My Airbnb address is 704 Haynes Place, Knoxville. That's in the 4th and Gill neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5729)|
| 1:35:37| I just wanted to tell you guys how I got into this quote-unquote illegal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| Contrary to what several people have said here about long-term renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| Excuse me, are you for or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I'm against the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Sorry, I think when they asked for or against it was a little confusing on what we're for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| So anyways, I bought this house, was really excited, just graduated college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| First major investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Moved in a long-term rental alongside the duplex that I bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| And my whole intent was to rent it so that I'd be able to help pay my mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| And I had a long-term renter tear up the inside of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| They did damage to the woodwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| And in a 4th and Gill house, as you can imagine, that kind of damage is extremely expensive to repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5782)|
| 1:36:28| In fact, some of the damage is still there because it's too much money to go back on original woodworking and fix these kind of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5788)|
| 1:36:35| So I had the bad experience of a long-term renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| And my mom said, hey, you know, on vacations we're always staying in like short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| Wonder if that would work in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| And so the side that I was living on, I threw it up on Airbnb just to see what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| And immediately was booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| And it was a major financial relief to me because being new, I wasn't necessarily financially prepared, as I should have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5812)|
| 1:37:00| for all these things that can come along with long-term tenants when they damage properties in ways that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| And I now have eight properties, and I can tell you long-term tenants continue to damage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5826)|
| 1:37:12| Not saying that short-term renters can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| I've had one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| I have 300-and-something reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| If that gives you an idea, definitely they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| But I haven't seen that issue, and I think it's because of the accountability of reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| Our situation, I actually put in my resignation at my job in December because I had, at 25 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| finally established my own business with our rentals to be able to move to that full-time one Airbnb property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5853)|
| 1:37:42| The rest not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| But Airbnb making a significant portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| It's now a non-owner-occupied duplex and had the misfortune of finding out about all of this legislation post that happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5866)|
| 1:37:55| and kind of had to go into panic mode these last few months to try and reestablish a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| I now work a job that's a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I'm a national account representative for a Fortune 50 company, but it keeps me out of Knoxville all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| And the intent was I love my city, and I wanted to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| And the way this legislation personally impacts my family is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5893)|
| 1:38:19| So my suggestion would be to reconsider the owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| We're not here to do bad things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| I mow my neighbors' yards when they don't mow it because I don't want a bad review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| And from the taxes portion, if you guys decide to tax us, okay, we can afford a 3% tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Natalie, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| With all due respect, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5916)|

| 1:38:50| Sorry if I mispronounced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| You'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5933)|

| 1:38:59| I'm Barbara Carlin, and I live at 4997 Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| Sorry, I'm losing my voice today with the allergies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| Since 2015, my husband and I have owned an Airbnb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5949)|
| 1:39:15| We actually got a city and county license and insurance, and it wasn't easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| And we've already been paying the occupancy tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| We're about to pay the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| I told my neighbors what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| They were all supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| And I just want to say, since the recession, we've all lost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| And this is about the middle class being able to have a mom-and-pop business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| And, you know, in America, we've lost too many small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| So we're hoping the city will be supportive of this new small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| And most of us have to work two jobs, and this is the second job for most of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| So Airbnb paid the bills when my insurance would not pay, and I had $50,000 in medical bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6002)|
| 1:40:13| and I had a life-saving operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| So for us, it was out of necessity that we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| John Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Mr. Ford, state your name and address, and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6032)|
| 1:40:45| Yeah, I'm John Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| I live at 400 Larch Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| I'm for short-term rentals, but there's one tiny line in the proposed regulations that I'm against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6049)|
| 1:40:58| and that is the regulation says that all owners of the property have to prove residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6058)|
| 1:41:10| But I think that as long as one person that is on the deed lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| that that should prove that there's an owner-occupant residency requirement that's been fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6077)|
| 1:41:26| I know this is kind of a small subset, but that is what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6086)|
| 1:41:35| I know these guys know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| Thank you very much, Mr. Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Richard Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| You'll state your name and address, and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| I'm Richard Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| I live at 14 Park Glen Road in the Forest Brook area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| My wife and I have lived in our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| It will be 47 years in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| We bought that house, secure in the knowledge that we were living in a single-family residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6122)|
| 1:42:11| To allow this ordinance to proceed, I think, will destroy the integrity of the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6131)|
| 1:42:20| There will be no more single-family residential areas in Knoxville, exclusive as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6140)|
| 1:42:29| I appreciate the statements made by those who are operating the Airbnb's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| but all of those statements thus far revolve around how good it's been for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| It's income-producing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| They get good reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Well, two people to every room, a maximum of, what, 12 or 13, bring in automobiles to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6166)|
| 1:42:57| We live in a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| We can't handle any more automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| A lady that spoke a minute ago acknowledged our concern, and that is that this is a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6182)|
| 1:43:10| It is a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| It's a revenue-producing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| So, basically, people moving to the city of Knoxville, if this ordinance passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| will not be allowed or will not be able to purchase a single-family dwelling in an exclusively residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6198)|
| 1:43:29| It will be partially a commercial, and they'll have to deal with that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| It appears to me that the city, there's some 300 of these, as I understand, that are in operation now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6217)|
| 1:43:46| and that the city has decided, well, if there's that many, even though they're not operating legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| this can be revenue-producing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| And I don't think that's a proper way to approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| We can generate revenue through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| I think that folks who have lived here all their lives, who purchased home, this is our major investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6242)|
| 1:44:11| That needs to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| I was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| My family has always lived in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| And I want to live here secure in the fact that my neighborhood will remain a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| Clint Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| Clint, if you will, state your name and address, and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| My name is Clint Olson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| I live at 6700 East Dick Ford Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| And I think there may have been a mix-up on my end, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| I am for the Airbnb, and I would like for them to reconsider the zoning, the rezoning for the R1 areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6288)|
| 1:44:58| Kind of like Natalie, I have the experience of I have several long-term rental homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| and this particular house we bought in a really nice area, and we did it as a long-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6303)|
| 1:45:10| And every renter we had, we ended up with multiple complaints from the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| and every time there was some damage done to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| And we really felt like we were bringing down the neighborhood by continuing to rent that long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| and had decided to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| And we didn't have any luck selling the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| We had multiple friends who had done the Airbnb and had been really successful with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| so we tried that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| And it has been great, not just for us but for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| We haven't had one complaint, and it's allowed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| It's brought in more money than long-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| and it's allowed us to fix the house up and make it a lot nicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| So I really think that needs to be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| But that's just from my viewpoint alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| But all the negative things I'm hearing about it are kind of hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| Is there a record of how many Airbnb guests there have been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| Did you say 8,000? Did you give a number? Was it 8,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| It's what Visit Knoxville said, or somebody quoted that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| How many reported complaints are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| I think there have been approximately five over the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| Five total? So there's five of 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| So, I mean, that's a pretty low percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I would think that's enough to reconsider the idea of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| So I just feel like we're taking a hypothetical situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| and trying to enforce something that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| I'm all for the integrity of the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| but I think we should kind of weigh this out and see what we need to do about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| before we're trying to make some decision based on nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| We don't have any proof or record of enough to enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| That completes the number of people that have signed up to speak either for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| Bill, do you all have any closing remarks or anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| No, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| We are going to have this on the July 18th council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| We'll place it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| I'm sure you and us will hear from folks between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| but we just appreciate everybody's attention throughout this entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| and we appreciate councils taking this on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Krista, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Oh, questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| We do have an e-mail address up there, questionsstrs at knoxville10.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| You can send comments in to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| We've gotten a lot there or questions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| and we'll consider all of them as we have to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| We've heard from an awful lot of people and appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Mayor Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| Does the light not work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Thank you, Mayor Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| I guess I'd just ask my colleagues, if you have amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| sort of like we've done previously, if you can maybe post them on the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| I don't know about you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| I always find it difficult to weigh an amendment on an important piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| sort of on the fly, and I think that's our best tool, so I'd just request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| You know, obviously it's not a rule we have, but it's just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| Council, anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Anyone else have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Well, I want to thank all those folks who came out tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| and participated in this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| I want to thank the administration for their presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| and I want to thank my colleagues for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| We have quite a bit of work, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| It sounds like there's also the possibility of tweaking what's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| so I think we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| I also just want to let the public know that there will be two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| so there will be additional time for folks to make comments to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| And as I said earlier, feel free to contact each and every one of us with your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Council, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170629?start=6547)|
