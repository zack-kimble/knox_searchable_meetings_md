| 2:28:30| to see if they discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| I am inclined to support this after listening to Mr. Ahrens at multiple meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8912)|
| 2:28:37| and along many years, seven years, on Neighborhood Advisory Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| about how this is just totally unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| I think this is the better approach to guardrails because it still serves that purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8924)|
| 2:28:50| but it gives a quantifiable, reasonable way, number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| Zillow is not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| It's not accurate for my home, but it is a guideline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| and I agree with Mr. Ahrens' assumption there that when you walk up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| hey, there are occupancy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| How many bedrooms does this home have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8946)|
| 2:29:09| Their probably gut reaction is going to be to be honest and not go, hmm, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| And then they can't change that number without pulling a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| So one of the things that we struggle with as council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| in terms of constituents complaining about enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| is the staff's ability to enforce things that are passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| And we know, we've acknowledged in lengthy discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| that what we've had on the books for a long time has been controversial and hard to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| and I think this is more reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| So I'm going to support that motion and give us, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| a better set of guardrails to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| Mr. Ahrens, I'm glad you used the word invasive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| because that's what I'm feeling about this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| We're talking about people's bedrooms, who's living where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| knocking on their door and just asking a lot of personal questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| that I don't think is our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| What is my business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| Disturbance, if there are too many cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| if there is something visible going on outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| then it is intruding on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| Otherwise, leave them alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9021)|
| 2:30:27| Well, actually, that's up to council then to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| Mr. Ahrens is just implementing the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| I was just looking towards him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| That has been decided for him, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| Let me look at you guys and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| so I think we need to take out some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| These are guardrails that we're putting our values on other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| That's not our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| That's not our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| I'm going to stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9047)|
| 2:30:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9051)|
| 2:30:52| So under this new proposal, if you had, say, a 200-square-foot studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| would that be only one person could live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| 150-square-foot per person, so one person, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| Based on this, it says that's my rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| I'll look to Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| But there's no bedroom square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9073)|
| 2:31:14| If it's just a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| I believe he said that was addressed under the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| We'll marry the zoning and the property maintenance together on a sidebar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| I just looked up the property assessor's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| and they do identify the number of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| so that's not something we would be asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| So it would be very easy to say you've got three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| You're allowed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| So is a studio one bedroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| Studio is zero bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| You're sleeping in your common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| So would one person allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| I mean, that says it has to have 50 square feet of bedroom floor space, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9111)|
| 2:31:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9118)|
| 2:31:59| So you couldn't live in your studio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| Why do you live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| You can't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| You can live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9123)|
| 2:32:04| But that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| With this proposal, you can't live there in a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9126)|
| 2:32:12| You've got 150 foot for each occupant and 50 square foot of it for each occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9132)|
| 2:32:17| That can be part of the 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Your bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| The whole thing is your bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9140)|
| 2:32:21| But a bedroom floor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9141)|
| 2:32:24| The whole thing is your bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| I'm asking the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9149)|
| 2:32:30| If there's no bedroom, then how do you have 50 square feet of bedroom floor space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| And I guess my follow-up question is, certainly two people couldn't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9154)|
| 2:32:39| Because it's below 300 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| And so is that also what we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| Because there are really small studios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| I actually lived in one in Miami.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| I mean, it would be a real tester to live in there with somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| I could sit on my bed and do the dishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9177)|
| 2:33:09| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| I mean, I just think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| And I'm not sure if in Knoxville there are any units that small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9192)|
| 2:33:19| Would you like some insight to the property maintenance code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| Yes, because this isn't new, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9202)|
| 2:33:25| Go right ahead, Mr. Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9205)|
| 2:33:26| So we have efficiency units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| Nothing in this section shall prohibit an efficiency living unit from meeting the following requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| A unit occupied by not more than one occupant shall have a minimum clear floor area of 120 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| A unit occupied by not more than two occupants shall have a minimum clear floor area of 220 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| Three is 320.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| It goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| I haven't had a whole lot of—this is the first I'm seeing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9242)|
| 2:34:03| I mean, me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| So we'll figure out how to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| These are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| And we can talk with Director Green and figure out what it is and Councilman Wallace to find out what it is, what the intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9250)|
| 2:34:20| And we can make sure that our interpretation is clear with the intent as far as whether that 150 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| can include the 50 square foot for the bedroom or if it has to be 150 plus 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9265)|
| 2:34:35| I think you'd look at what HUD has guidelines for what is a bedroom and what is not and what are efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9275)|
| 2:34:40| You look outside and you look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| So square footage is measured on the outside of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| I mean, if there was any appeal that conflicted with our public records, then we can measure the outside of the house without having to go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9286)|
| 2:34:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| But HUD has guidelines and they have definitions of what constitutes a bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| You can't walk through another room to get to that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| So you can't use the dining room to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| I mean, there's other ways to—HUD's got those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| And I think you would kind of drop back to that and, you know, rely on existing definitions already in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9308)|
| 2:35:16| I can tell you in all of—I've been with the city for five-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| Every complaint, we're not talking about a tiny efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| We're talking about a sizable house that's probably 800 square foot or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| You're looking for an easy way to be able to measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| You say, how many bedrooms, how many people, and you can do some math, and it's pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| It's not judgmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| And that's what—you know, the way it's written is it's judgmental on who the people are and how they're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| And it's just—it's way too, you know, invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| This is your word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| I just wanted to say the only time I know this being a complaint about this called in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| and I've talked about this example in the past, was where around 30 cars were at one single residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9364)|
| 2:36:11| And it was impact points to the community around, which is why this was drafted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| So it wasn't, hey, there's five cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| It was a traffic and impact quality of life in a dense neighborhood with large numbers of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9381)|
| 2:36:29| Address somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| So Director Ahrens, just wanted to circle back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9397)|
| 2:36:45| Originally when you and I were talking about this early in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| you were saying that in order to enforce this, you'd have to actually go inside the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| Have you changed your mind based on the discussion that we've had, which is totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9413)|
| 2:36:58| I just want to make sure I'm clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9418)|
| 2:37:00| I think that we can get a lot of information from the property assessor's records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9420)|
| 2:37:10| Yes, I've changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| My ability to support the amendment is key on, right now you don't have to go into the property when you deal with the current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9433)|
| 2:37:24| And I don't want to have anything that we're doing today mean that in order to enforce it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| you're going to have to go into the property because that's, to me, completely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9449)|
| 2:37:36| The last thing I'd ask is about functional equivalency with what you have in this proposed language versus what you have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9456)|
| 2:37:46| and whether or not you'd have any less ability to address these issues if we make the change in this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9466)|
| 2:38:01| Is the issue too many people or how they're related to each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9481)|
| 2:38:06| I think the language that's in this is really very broad, and that's why it encompasses so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9486)|
| 2:38:14| But it says, you know, it has words in it that I think are difficult, and I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| and that's why I think it needs to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| But I think the calls that I get about this issue are, the house next door has 14 cars parked in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9504)|
| 2:38:33| and, you know, we're having issues, and I actually get e-mails, you know, once a week, and you've seen them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9513)|
| 2:38:41| because I've sent them to you, where they take pictures of all the cars lined up and down the street from one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9521)|
| 2:38:48| So my question to you is, if we make this change, are you going to have less ability to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9528)|
| 2:38:55| than you would under the current language, which we could always update later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9535)|
| 2:39:18| I think I'll have more tools, only because with the ability to find out the area of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9558)|
| 2:39:28| and the habitable space, and then going and engaging whoever's living there, getting an honest answer from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9568)|
| 2:39:37| we've got solid ground to work on and an honest answer, and we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9577)|
| 2:39:44| We've got parking ordinances, we've got noise ordinances to address the negative impacts on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9584)|
| 2:39:51| I understand many times it's not to the liking of the neighbors, because unless there's a no parking sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9591)|
| 2:39:56| people can park on the streets, but those are the two ordinances that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| that predominantly deal with negative impacts on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9601)|
| 2:40:11| If I can start with a solid place and get a good answer, I feel like I'm better equipped to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9611)|
| 2:40:19| rather than starting from an honest answer and returning to something that may be not honest, and having no recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9619)|
| 2:40:30| So you feel like this proposed language gives you more tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| and you'd have an easier time addressing these issues if we make this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9635)|
| 2:40:40| I don't think it's ever easy. I think I'll have firmer foundation to stand on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| Okay. Well then, I can support that language. I do think it needs to get updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| and it sounds like Councilmember Wallace has found some language that would work, so I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9648)|
| 2:40:55| All right. Thank you. Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| What tools would you have available if one person was living by themselves in a large house and owned 30 cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9661)|
| 2:41:14| They'll need to park them legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| And when they don't, they'll get a notice, and then they'll move them to a legal location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9678)|
| 2:41:24| So it's the impact outside of the house that was the problem, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| with the number of people inside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| That's what I keep focusing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| And I will want to look at this deeply and probably bring it to the advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9694)|
| 2:41:41| to make sure that it says what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9701)|
| 2:41:46| So we're at a point where we have a motion and a second on revising what is currently in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9706)|
| 2:41:54| to this simpler standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| If Council votes for this, then our staff will work on this to figure out the best way to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9718)|
| 2:42:07| If there are suggestions that they have on how to revise this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| they'll take it to the stakeholder committee and continue to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| So, again, it's none of this, and this is a perfect example of the varying opinions in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9735)|
| 2:42:22| from those who want a lot of restrictions to those who want no restrictions and all the spectrum along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| This is the job of Council to try and work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| And whatever Council decides, then our staff attempts to implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| So we have a motion and a second on this, and we've got one more light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9755)|
| 2:42:40| I just want to ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| This language already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| It's in the property maintenance code because it's safety and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9768)|
| 2:42:49| And what does that mean it's part of the property maintenance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| Is that part of the building code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| Yeah, it's part of the construction codes and, well, yes, it's part of the codes we've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| So it's not just a Knoxville thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| It's an adopted standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| It's based on the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9786)|
| 2:43:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| So pretty thorough discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| And the motion is to delete C and D on pages 4-2, 4-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9793)|
| 2:43:20| and replace it with this in yellow highlighted, which is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9800)|
| 2:43:26| That's clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| Y'all ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9808)|
| 2:43:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9809)|
| 2:43:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| I'm against changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| I don't like either option, so I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| Can I make an amendment to do different wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| What I would suggest, so it just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| So I would suggest that you work with Peter and the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| if there are other revisions that you would like to see, because now we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| This is a new way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| We've just changed the way it's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| And so now we'll try and work and see if staff can implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9840)|
| 2:44:06| and what additional changes may be needed, and that will be outside of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| but starting through the stakeholder committee and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| So that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9864)|
| 2:44:25| Other counsel initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9865)|
| 2:44:30| Are you going to bring something up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| If so, then I want to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9871)|
| 2:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9876)|
| 2:44:37| Brief bathroom break or whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| As we're getting ready, waiting for one councilwoman to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| we will, I believe we're ready to move on to staff initiated changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| which is the blue worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| We're done with the white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| You're done with the white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9894)|
| 2:44:55| And unless somebody or something else folks want to circle back to, then we will move on from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9895)|
| 2:45:16| So now we are on the blue worksheet, which says staff initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| We're actually going to start on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| We do need to do something on page three that we had looked at on May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9923)|
| 2:45:32| Staff has a request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9932)|
| 2:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| We are on the staff initiated worksheet, the blue pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| We are on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| Up at the top, row number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| Does everybody see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| And this is dealing with landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9956)|
| 2:46:01| In your code, it is page 12-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9961)|
| 2:46:15| 12.2C, 12.2C, minor changes to approved landscape plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9975)|
| 2:46:25| Is everybody with me on that, where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| I'm going to ask Christina to tell us what the issue is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| What I did during the break, I put together a visual on this, just so that we can all be on the same page here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9994)|
| 2:46:39| This visual shows the consistency we're trying to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=9999)|
| 2:46:44| given the change in attempting to send the landscaping review process back to the zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10004)|
| 2:46:50| and having alternative landscaping still reviewed by the administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| and then forwarded to the zoning administrator for a final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10015)|
| 2:46:58| So you'll see the update to 12.2 part C, changing that to zoning administrator here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10018)|
| 2:47:07| In part D2, the review staying for, again, the alternative landscaping plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10027)|
| 2:47:14| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| Did I have people on the right page or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| This is a visual I created during the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| Oh, it's just a visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| Yeah, just to try to address confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10041)|
| 2:47:24| D2 here, reviewed by the administrative review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| That's for the alternative landscaping plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| The zoning administrator reviews all landscaping plans when they're required under Article 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10052)|
| 2:47:40| And 14.8 part B just clarifies that the administrative review committee has this particular power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10060)|
| 2:47:51| So hopefully that shows everybody what the goal is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| to put it all in the Department of Plans Review and Inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| with assistance as needed for alternative landscaping with the ARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| I'll make a motion to approve these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| And that's what you need, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10090)|
| 2:48:11| You need that motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10093)|
| 2:48:14| Is there discussion about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| Everybody understands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10096)|
| 2:48:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10102)|
| 2:48:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10103)|
| 2:48:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10106)|
| 2:48:28| So that's all we need on that page, right, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10108)|
| 2:48:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| So moving on in the blue packet, the staff-initiated changes, we are now on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10111)|
| 2:48:46| So let me see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| So 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| So we're on page 8 of the blue packet, number 12, row 12, Article 2, General Definition and Measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10135)|
| 2:49:04| This is just an FYI that no action is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| This was approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| Is that correct to staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| We don't need action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| We just want to point this out to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| She's pointing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| And also on number 13, under Nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| Again, this was approved by Planning Commission, and we are comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10162)|
| 2:49:32| So then if you move on down to row 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| Oh, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| We already did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10177)|
| 2:49:38| That's hillside protection, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| So we already handled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| As well as on the next page, staff, stop me if I'm wrong on any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10184)|
| 2:49:51| And so now let's move to page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10191)|
| 2:50:03| This is where we need some action, correct, Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10207)|
| 2:50:08| So page 10 in the packet, row 15, Article 2, General Definition and Measurement Methodologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10208)|
| 2:50:17| This is on page 2-24, so we're way back to 2 in the code, 2-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10217)|
| 2:50:30| Okay, so our proposed change, staff's proposed change, is to revise the second sentence of the storage yard outdoor to read as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10230)|
| 2:50:42| When an outdoor storage yard is allowed as a secondary use, such storage yard must be associated with the principal use on the lot, and it continues on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10242)|
| 2:50:54| That's basically a clarification that was asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| Councilwoman Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10261)|
| 2:51:07| I appreciate the attempt at the fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10267)|
| 2:51:13| This is so incredibly important and so incredibly dull, I mean, storage yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10273)|
| 2:51:20| I'm fascinated by all of this, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| If we weren't all fascinated, we wouldn't still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10284)|
| 2:51:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| It's a type of addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| That might be a treatment when this is over, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| There is no definition for outdoor storage for yard, storage yard, outdoor, comma, secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10298)|
| 2:51:51| This became clear at the May 30th meeting in a discussion with Mr. Ahrens at around midnight as the meeting moved on, but we did have pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10311)|
| 2:52:06| And in draft five, for the first time, outdoor yard storage secondary, undefined in the recode, appeared in the matrix as a special use in CG, which is the present C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10326)|
| 2:52:30| And what became clear and has been clarified here is that outdoor storage yard secondary can be larger, larger than the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10350)|
| 2:52:42| I think this is absolutely inconsistent with the purpose of CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| That's what lines Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| It aligns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Those are the businesses that line Broadway and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10370)|
| 2:52:56| It would allow a small building and a much bigger shielded, buffered outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10376)|
| 2:53:08| CG is supposed to be a mixed use, residential, pedestrian oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10388)|
| 2:53:15| This is different from what we presently have in C3, which does allow incidental outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10395)|
| 2:53:23| Also buffered, but does not allow outdoor storage that is larger than the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10403)|
| 2:53:30| I would suggest that some of the recommendations, some of the amendments for definitions and so on that Councilman Roberto has put forth be seriously considered and be adopted this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10410)|
| 2:53:46| Again, CG should and does appropriately allow outdoor storage accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10426)|
| 2:53:54| By its definition, accessory would be smaller than the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| But you can't have a walkable, livable, mixed use commercial zone and have outdoor storage larger than the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10439)|
| 2:54:11| That's the highway commercial presence C4 configuration of a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10451)|
| 2:54:18| That's not what ought to be seen as consistent with walkable, human sized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10458)|
| 2:54:27| If you look at the purpose of CG, reminiscent of old downtown development, think about what this will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10467)|
| 2:54:37| We ask that Councilman Roberto's amendments be considered. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10477)|
| 2:54:42| I think this came to us as a question from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10482)|
| 2:54:48| You asked staff to work on this. This is their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10488)|
| 2:54:52| Now, as she said, it's my understanding that the staff's proposal was prior to the amendments that Councilman Roberto came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10492)|
| 2:55:08| I might be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10508)|
| 2:55:09| You mean their response to his original thing was prior to the amendments that he had come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10509)|
| 2:55:18| At least that's how I received them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| That may be true. Do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| Yes. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| I believe that after I had written the 24 questions, I think, that I sent to Gerald and Peter and several others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10524)|
| 2:55:39| I had developed some amendments which I think are in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| And so these are actually numbers six and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| I think they are in the packet because they came later, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| Oh, they may not be. But I did send them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| It was just in the last two days or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| But you did see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10556)|
| 2:55:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10557)|
| 2:55:58| I do want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| They just didn't make it into the packet in time for printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10559)|
| 2:56:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| But also, I just want to say that there are several of them. You and I have talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| And staff hasn't really had a sufficient amount of time to really review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10567)|
| 2:56:11| So this is something that you might want to consider whether in the, that we work on this post-adoption of RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10571)|
| 2:56:22| and get it right where there's more time where Ms. Malone and you all and staff can have time to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10582)|
| 2:56:31| Hold on a second, please. See if Councilman Roberto wants to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| Mayor, I think this is one that I do have some language that I can propose and we can go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10595)|
| 2:56:43| I don't think it will take that long to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10603)|
| 2:56:46| But I think this is really critical because it is proposed to line up and down Kingston Pike and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10606)|
| 2:56:56| And I think just like what Ms. Malone had just said, that's supposed to be pedestrian-oriented environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10616)|
| 2:57:03| and I just don't think it's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| Okay. So you're talking about right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10625)|
| 2:57:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| Okay. All right. So you have some words you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| So I'll just go through what I had proposed in that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| It's Article 2, Section 2.3, Page 2-24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| change the definition for storage yard outdoor to the storage of materials outdoors as a principal use of the land for more than 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10641)|
| 2:57:37| Do I need to go slower so you can type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| No, not at all. I actually just had to add an S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| And then in Article 2, Section 2.3, Page 2-24, for the definition of storage yard outdoor secondary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10663)|
| 2:57:51| an outdoor storage yard containing materials and or equipment that serves another principal use on the same lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10671)|
| 2:58:00| The storage yard outdoor secondary may be larger than the principal use it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10680)|
| 2:58:15| And what this is really dealing with is the distinction between the size of the buildings related to the outdoor storage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10695)|
| 2:58:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10703)|
| 2:58:29| Let's see if I can get that up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10709)|
| 2:58:41| Will you just check that for me, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| This is the fun part where we get to read it back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| Load it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10728)|
| 2:58:54| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10734)|
| 2:59:03| Do you want to make another comment, Ms. Malone, on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10743)|
| 2:59:08| I'm trying to read it. I believe it is what had been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10748)|
| 2:59:15| And I would also ask then that storage yard outdoor secondary use, because it is, I think, inconsistent with the purpose of the CG zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10755)|
| 2:59:32| that it be removed from the matrix as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| Again, that was put in at Draft 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| If there's a need in the future to put it in, I mean, this has to do with all of our major streets, not just Kingston, Pike, and Broadway, but Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10780)|
| 2:59:50| I mean, you name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10790)|
| 2:59:52| If we're going to try to encourage housing and walkability, a parking lot, a storage area larger than the building is just flat out inconsistent and inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10792)|
| 3:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10807)|
| 3:00:08| So, did we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| Did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| I think there was an original motion for the staff language, and then I guess I made a motion to amend to the proposed language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10812)|
| 3:00:20| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10820)|
| 3:00:21| He offered a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10821)|
| 3:00:22| He offered a substitute motion from what was on there on the blue page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10827)|
| 3:00:28| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10828)|
| 3:00:29| Thank you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| Let's talk about how we got here with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10830)|
| 3:00:35| In CG, we have existing bids now that have a requirement for outside storage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| The one that comes most immediately to mind is Mayo Garden Center on Kingston Pike, which has a storage display area larger than the principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10842)|
| 3:00:54| Staff felt that by identifying it as a special use in the CG with a requirement for special review by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10854)|
| 3:01:05| any adverse impacts on the walkability of a corridor would be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| If there were problems anticipated with the outdoor storage, the Planning Commission could deny that request for a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10871)|
| 3:01:21| Trying to compromise, meeting with developers who wanted the outdoor storage, seeing places where it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10881)|
| 3:01:28| but also hearing the concerns of Ms. Malone and the others that there are some instances where outdoor storage in the CG would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10888)|
| 3:01:37| Trying to bridge a compromise, and in our diverse community, it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10897)|
| 3:01:42| We've heard some of the voices tonight trying to satisfy the small representation of Knoxville that's in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10902)|
| 3:01:50| It's something that we'll never reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| Imagine trying to satisfy 189,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10912)|
| 3:01:59| That's a need for compromise, and that's what the attempt was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| I think that's what you did, and I think you've got enough uses out there in CG that require some outside storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10923)|
| 3:02:13| I don't think we can go back and unwind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| We've discussed it, and I don't see that many where we've got that big a lot in that small a building where it's offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10939)|
| 3:02:31| Give me an example of one where I can explain it and where I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| If I could speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| Give me an example of where you see outside storage now in this area where it's offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10959)|
| 3:02:46| It is not presently allowed in C3 to be larger than the building, and I would argue that MEOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10966)|
| 3:02:53| and there aren't many MEOs around or unfortunately many coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10973)|
| 3:02:58| but I would argue MEOs is not outdoor storage that has to be screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10978)|
| 3:03:03| It is display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| That's a different deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| Outdoor sales and display is different from storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| and we are not proposing that there can be no outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10991)|
| 3:03:17| There's a different category, which is outdoor storage accessory, which is separate from storage yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=10997)|
| 3:03:26| and that allows outdoor storage, but the area has to be smaller than the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11006)|
| 3:03:32| Also, it has to be screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| So we're not saying no outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| We're saying what is allowed now in C3 as incidental is the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11019)|
| 3:03:45| Screened, incidental, and distinguish that from what, for instance, a lumber yard or something could do in a C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11025)|
| 3:03:57| We could have a small building and large outdoor storage, larger than the building, or a hardware store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11037)|
| 3:04:08| We think it should be accessory, which would still be permitted in CG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11048)|
| 3:04:15| but it would have the ideas whether it's larger than or smaller than the size of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11055)|
| 3:04:24| Would you consider a hardware store with outside storage of mulch and bags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11064)|
| 3:04:30| and those kind of materials to be storage or display?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11070)|
| 3:04:35| We don't have a definition of display, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11075)|
| 3:04:38| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| So what now defines storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| There's an accessory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| There is outdoor display and sales in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11086)|
| 3:04:55| Again, it's the size of the storage relative to the building, and we're not saying no outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11095)|
| 3:05:02| We're saying what's allowed now would be similar to what's allowed in C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11102)|
| 3:05:10| What do you think, Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| Again, I can—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| I mean, you know, I think we reached a compromise before on this with an influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11113)|
| 3:05:20| in talking with people that were in this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| I mean, they're in that, so that was where we were trying to reach the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| And I did think that the special use was reviewed by the planning commission as a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| and this becomes a policy issue that's up to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11132)|
| 3:05:39| I hate to throw it back to you, but this recommendation from staff was that special use is a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11139)|
| 3:05:46| and now the question is, is that special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| Is it appropriate in the CG?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| Ms. Malone, is I correct that the purpose of the CG is to enhance the pedestrian atmosphere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11152)|
| 3:06:00| Does something like—does outdoor storage detract from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| That's a question that has to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| And does the planning commission have the ability to minimize those negative impacts through a special use review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11166)|
| 3:06:14| I think the planning commission has the ability to make those determinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11174)|
| 3:06:21| So I don't support the amendment or the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11184)|
| 3:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11185)|
| 3:06:26| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11188)|
| 3:06:29| On Western Avenue, there is a—I'm not sure what they sell, but whether it's display or storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11189)|
| 3:06:38| they have toilets and broken sinks and appliances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11198)|
| 3:06:42| I think a special use would have been very nice before that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11202)|
| 3:06:47| I know that will be grandfathered in, but that's the type of thing that we would try to prevent with the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11207)|
| 3:06:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| So I'm going to give you guys an example that's gone from my area, but talking about walkable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11218)|
| 3:07:04| Let's talk about an area that what's old is new again and hip and happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| which is the Broadway and central corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11228)|
| 3:07:11| We used to have Knox 10 rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| And those would have been storage yards, not displays, where they had what is now the food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11233)|
| 3:07:20| And that would have been much bigger than the commercial building where the sales happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11240)|
| 3:07:25| Of course, they had the indoor storage yard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11245)|
| 3:07:29| So that is an example where you have like a full city block almost taken up by one business that has a lot of display,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11249)|
| 3:07:37| which is kind of what this is getting at the meat of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| But I also want to say, by putting things in special use, special use is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11259)|
| 3:07:46| And let me help and see if I understand this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11266)|
| 3:07:49| But if something goes before review to MPC, to planning staff as a special use, as long as it meets the criteria, it gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11269)|
| 3:08:01| You have to have legal grounds to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| So it just needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| And I'm going to defer to Mr. Swanson on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11286)|
| 3:08:12| My opinion is that the planning commission has pretty broad purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11292)|
| 3:08:18| And if you look at the provisions in I think it's Article 16 in here for special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11298)|
| 3:08:23| there are things like impact on the adjoining neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| It's not just the specific standards that may be in Section 10 for that use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11306)|
| 3:08:33| but it's also those broad parameters that are in Article 16 that the planning commission has to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11313)|
| 3:08:40| that those factors are addressed through the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11320)|
| 3:08:45| They have more latitude than just the black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| They have the realm of nebulousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11328)|
| 3:08:56| Is that an appropriate word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11336)|
| 3:08:59| I don't want to have a false sense of comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11339)|
| 3:09:03| So, Mr. Swanson, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| I think the special use will allow some degree of discretion based on the facts that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11346)|
| 3:09:14| The decision makers are not going to be allowed to be completely arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| and capricious in how they apply the decisions that they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11358)|
| 3:09:24| So there are limitations upon, say, for example, you have three situations that come up that are exactly alike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11364)|
| 3:09:36| and you grant a special use on two but don't grant the special use on the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| The court's going to have a problem with that unless you can distinguish in some way factually why that happened to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11381)|
| 3:09:49| So I think it's just a matter of giving appropriate training to those who are making the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11389)|
| 3:09:55| that you have to have some sort of reasoned decision for doing what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| But that doesn't mean that you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| It just means that you have to have a rational basis, a reasoned decision being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11404)|
| 3:10:12| as opposed to just being arbitrary and capricious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| And that's about as good as I can tell you because that's all the judge will tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11415)|
| 3:10:24| Okay. Is there more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| So we have a substitute motion from Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11426)|
| 3:10:32| Motion and a second on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| Are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11437)|
| 3:10:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11438)|
| 3:10:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11440)|
| 3:10:41| Who are the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11443)|
| 3:10:44| So it does pass 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11444)|
| 3:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| Anything else on that one, Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11454)|
| 3:10:55| To clarify, just because we discussed a couple of the different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| but I don't think it was in Councilmember Roberto's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| This was the definition of storage yard and storage yard outdoor secondary use, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11463)|
| 3:11:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11471)|
| 3:11:12| It had nothing to do with whether it was permitted in any zoning district or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| I do have that in my packet, but that's not the subject matter of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11476)|
| 3:11:23| so I don't know if it's appropriate to bring that one up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| But that was part of what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11485)|
| 3:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11490)|
| 3:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11491)|
| 3:11:32| So now we are continuing on that on page 10 in the blue packet, number 16, article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11492)|
| 3:11:40| Page 10-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| It's basically a clarification, consistency of language to replace home office with the term home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11504)|
| 3:11:55| It's page 10-10, R, home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11515)|
| 3:11:59| If you see number 2 there in green, it says the use of the dwelling unit for the home office shall be clearly incidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11519)|
| 3:12:07| Office should say occupation to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11532)|
| 3:12:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11535)|
| 3:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11536)|
| 3:12:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11537)|
| 3:12:18| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11538)|
| 3:12:19| Next is article 14, so page 14-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11539)|
| 3:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11548)|
| 3:12:29| 14-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11549)|
| 3:12:30| I'm going to call on Christina to explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11550)|
| 3:12:33| We already tackled that in the visual I put up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11556)|
| 3:12:37| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11557)|
| 3:12:38| We're already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11558)|
| 3:12:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11559)|
| 3:12:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11560)|
| 3:12:41| That is the end of the blue packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| So are there, so now we're looking at are there other council-initiated actions that anybody wants to bring up right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11563)|
| 3:12:59| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11580)|
| 3:13:05| Throughout this process, the accessory dwelling units have been a source of a lot of debate and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11585)|
| 3:13:13| and have also been a source of a lot of concern from the neighborhoods in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11593)|
| 3:13:18| and I believe in many other districts as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11598)|
| 3:13:22| as there's a feeling that we're moving away from a single-family neighborhood that they've invested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11602)|
| 3:13:31| For me and I know a lot of other folks, your home is really your single largest investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11611)|
| 3:13:39| and it is very concerning, I think, to folks to think of big changes like that in the area where they have made that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11619)|
| 3:13:53| I know my fellow colleagues and I have all worked very hard to understand what's in RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11633)|
| 3:14:00| and have all worked really hard to improve this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| And in consultation with the neighborhoods that I represent, and there is a diversity of opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11644)|
| 3:14:11| but they really feel like they don't have the infrastructure to support additional dwelling units inside their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11651)|
| 3:14:24| In one of our previous meetings, I had asked for an amendment to the established neighborhood part of RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11664)|
| 3:14:34| which would allow a new application for established neighborhood, which is driven by the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11674)|
| 3:14:41| It's a neighborhood-led process to make a decision inside the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11681)|
| 3:14:48| about whether or not their infrastructure can support ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11688)|
| 3:14:53| Presently, they don't allow duplexes in established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11693)|
| 3:14:58| Again, this would only be for new applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| So what I am asking counsel tonight for is I know we've all worked really hard on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11702)|
| 3:15:10| and I hope you feel like I have been working hard on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11710)|
| 3:15:16| This issue actually separates me from being able to support RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11716)|
| 3:15:22| I cannot support RECODE if we don't have an option for my neighborhoods to deal with their infrastructure issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11722)|
| 3:15:31| and adding density into their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11731)|
| 3:15:37| So I would make the same motion I made on the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11737)|
| 3:15:44| Could you bring us to the right page and number and all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| Which is on page 10-4, Part B, Accessory Dwelling Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11746)|
| 3:15:55| And all we need to do is make one change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11755)|
| 3:16:03| And it would say an ADU may be located only on a lot with one single-family dwelling in RN-1 and RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11763)|
| 3:16:12| Wait a minute, first, which right down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| Section B, subsection 2, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| Page 10-4, section B, subsection 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11781)|
| 3:16:22| An ADU may be located only on a lot with one single-family dwelling in RN-1 and RN-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11782)|
| 3:16:28| and shall be permitted in EN only if the neighborhood so designates in a new EN application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11788)|
| 3:16:36| One of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11796)|
| 3:16:42| Councilman, could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| Well, since it didn't get a second last time, you might not need to type that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11805)|
| 3:16:51| Something to do over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| Where do you want me to start back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| After in EN only if?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| Permitted in an EN only if the neighborhood so designates in a new EN application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11820)|
| 3:17:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11829)|
| 3:17:10| And then the rest of it's the same, I think, as present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11830)|
| 3:17:14| So I make that motion one more time, and I think there's a lot of really positive things in RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11834)|
| 3:17:23| and I think we've made some really good positive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| But in this particular instance, I really need some support here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11846)|
| 3:17:31| And I know that some of my neighbors are here, and they wanted to maybe make a presentation, if that would be okay, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11851)|
| 3:17:39| I would like to ask a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| In reading this, if I had a single-family home in an RN-3 zoning district with your amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11861)|
| 3:17:47| I would not be able to have an accessory dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| I don't think that's your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11870)|
| 3:17:51| That's not my intent, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11871)|
| 3:17:52| And I think it may be ‑‑ I'm trying to think of how to word that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11872)|
| 3:17:58| but I think the way it's worded now, we eliminate the opportunity for accessory dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| in those single-family homes in RN-3, RN-4, RN-5, RN-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11883)|
| 3:18:08| That may not want to be the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11888)|
| 3:18:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11891)|
| 3:18:12| So we'll think about a way to word that so that we don't eliminate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11892)|
| 3:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11896)|
| 3:18:17| Give them a second to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| Is that what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11899)|
| 3:18:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11900)|
| 3:18:21| Give them a second to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11901)|
| 3:18:22| And, Mayor, is it okay if I call on some of my neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| Sure, while they're thinking about it, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| Jay Schmidt, do you want to come down, or Donnie, do you want to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11906)|
| 3:18:30| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11910)|
| 3:18:33| Donnie, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| Donnie Ernst, 6830 Sheffield, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11921)|
| 3:18:48| On a lighter note, Mayor, at the very first of your meeting, you were mentioning activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11928)|
| 3:18:54| And, you know, you guys recognized us as a healthier neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11934)|
| 3:18:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11938)|
| 3:18:59| And Correa's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11939)|
| 3:19:00| And so we have a bicycle ride happening July 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| Anybody wants to join us, we're going to start at Earth Fair and go down the Greenway Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11944)|
| 3:19:07| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| Thank you for the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| I am the president of West Hills Community Association, so that's who I am representing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11951)|
| 3:19:16| So I'm just going to read you what I've written here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11956)|
| 3:19:21| Thank you for letting me say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| West Hills is a great place to live and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11963)|
| 3:19:26| That is why I and many of my neighbors have chosen to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11966)|
| 3:19:30| We like where we live, and we like the neighborhood and its character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11970)|
| 3:19:34| We want to keep what we presently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| We feel our neighborhood is as good as it is right now and doesn't need to be fixed because it is not broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11976)|
| 3:19:44| So if you, City Council, proceed with RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11984)|
| 3:19:48| the Executive Committee of the West Hills Community Association would support an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11988)|
| 3:19:53| so that an established neighborhood EN applications, ADU, accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=11993)|
| 3:20:00| would be optional for the neighborhood making the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12004)|
| 3:20:05| And may God bless all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12005)|
| 3:20:06| Thank you, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12006)|
| 3:20:13| Do you have others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12013)|
| 3:20:14| Yeah, Jay Schmidt from Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| Sir, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| My name is Jay Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12021)|
| 3:20:22| I live at 4218 Hiawatha, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12022)|
| 3:20:27| And I represent Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12027)|
| 3:20:33| On a lighter note, say something to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12033)|
| 3:20:38| Tonight was beer bored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| Do you have any samples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| That would make the meeting go better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12040)|
| 3:20:44| I think that's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| Dry bored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12045)|
| 3:20:49| This has been a long process for many, many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12049)|
| 3:20:53| And we realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| We'd like to give credit to the Council members for all the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12055)|
| 3:21:01| Gerald Green, his staff, has done a lot of work over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12061)|
| 3:21:07| We are not opposed completely to the concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12067)|
| 3:21:12| But Councilman Roberto, I think, has well stated some of our ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12072)|
| 3:21:18| And West Hills has also stated things that we feel are appropriate for all neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12078)|
| 3:21:27| not just ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| The issues that we have, just briefly, I think accessory dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12089)|
| 3:21:37| there should be a special use, use on review, whatever the new term is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12097)|
| 3:21:42| And I think that's something that Councilman Roberto has asked for in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12102)|
| 3:21:48| So we would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| Kingston Pike Sequoia has developed over 100 years or so, early development, early part of the 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12112)|
| 3:21:59| And it's developed into what's now a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12119)|
| 3:22:05| We've got single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| There's some small apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12127)|
| 3:22:10| There's some moderate apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| This commercial strip or commercial area in the middle of Sequoia, Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12132)|
| 3:22:18| is mostly residential in our neighborhood, but it's commercial on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12138)|
| 3:22:24| So we just like to keep things going in an appropriate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12144)|
| 3:22:29| We've got diverse roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| Our infrastructure is old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12153)|
| 3:22:34| A lot of it's being currently rebuilt by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12154)|
| 3:22:39| But we've got a lot of non-straight roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12159)|
| 3:22:43| There are roads that are not always super wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| If we get a lot of new development that concentrates things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12167)|
| 3:22:52| it's going to make more traffic and people parking on the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| Safety issues, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12176)|
| 3:22:58| Fire trucks already have occasionally had trouble getting around the school in Sequoia when there's events there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12178)|
| 3:23:05| Things like that just concern us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12185)|
| 3:23:11| And we would like, as Councilman Roberto has expressed, the idea of a pathway to establish neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12191)|
| 3:23:21| I think that's something that we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| A lot of drafts have gone through, a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| We appreciate what people have done, but I think there's still work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12210)|
| 3:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| That's why we still have our stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| Just to kind of wrap up my presentation here, you're not voting against ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12221)|
| 3:23:47| What you're voting for is a neighborhood-led process that allows the neighborhood to choose whether or not they have infrastructure that would support ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12227)|
| 3:23:59| That's all you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| The EN process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12241)|
| 3:24:02| EN neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12242)|
| 3:24:03| EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12243)|
| 3:24:04| Okay, explain how you're going to get West Hills, Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12244)|
| 3:24:09| any neighborhood to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12249)|
| 3:24:13| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| Is it 50 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12255)|
| 3:24:16| Is it 75 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| Is it 100 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12258)|
| 3:24:19| I mean, how are you going to do that and accumulate written ballots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| I mean, what type of process can you put forward tonight that we could say, yeah, that is a viable process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12264)|
| 3:24:31| The beautiful part about that is there's already a process because we already have EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12271)|
| 3:24:36| And Gerald and I have already talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| And what would happen is we would make a motion here, the neighborhood would create a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| and they would go and work with planning in setting up the boundary lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12284)|
| 3:24:51| Obviously, the ADUs would be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| So it already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| It's a neighborhood-led process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| So there's not really any structural change to it other than we're just saying, like right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12299)|
| 3:25:04| there's no duplexes in the recode version of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12304)|
| 3:25:11| We're just saying that it would be optional whether or not you had ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| Now, I know last time I brought up, because I thought the issue was, well, we don't want it to be optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12314)|
| 3:25:19| It's either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| I'm okay with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| But I think having the option is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| If you go back and explain how you're going to get an entire neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12326)|
| 3:25:30| or a section of a neighborhood to vote up or down, how many of the people would have to agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12330)|
| 3:25:37| What's the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12337)|
| 3:25:38| If you have that now, then what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| Gerald, do you want to explain how the process works now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12340)|
| 3:25:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12346)|
| 3:25:50| The process now works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12350)|
| 3:25:52| The staff works with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12352)|
| 3:25:54| And it's in some ways similar to a historic district overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12354)|
| 3:25:58| It's creating a new zoning district boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12358)|
| 3:26:02| There are design standards for new homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12362)|
| 3:26:06| And the challenge is getting a neighborhood to agree on those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| I don't know whether I'm fortunate or unfortunate in that I was not here when Old Westmoreland, Holston Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12370)|
| 3:26:17| and a portion of Chihuahua Hills went through the designation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| Those are pretty uniform neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| The final decision is up to council based on the input from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| as to whether there's enough agreement in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12390)|
| 3:26:33| And staff reviews that process and comes forward with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12393)|
| 3:26:39| based upon our perception of the agreement in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12399)|
| 3:26:43| And if there's discourse, no ability to agree on the design standards, on the development standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12403)|
| 3:26:49| then staff would not recommend the application of the EN designation to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12409)|
| 3:26:55| There is no set number that says 75% or 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12415)|
| 3:27:01| I mean, there's no way to define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12421)|
| 3:27:05| And, I mean, it's subject to a long, laborious type of thing where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12425)|
| 3:27:11| where some people are cut off from being able to have certain, you know, be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| I mean, we keep going back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12436)|
| 3:27:18| There's ADUs in all those subdivisions now, legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12438)|
| 3:27:23| So, I mean, it's, you know, obviously there's some need, but there's not many needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| As we said last time, how many permits do we have a year for an ADU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12447)|
| 3:27:32| Less than five, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12454)|
| 3:27:35| It's pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| I have been, and I know Councilman Wallace has been because we've been in the same meetings before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12457)|
| 3:27:42| but I have been in neighborhood meetings where they address traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12462)|
| 3:27:47| And those can be pretty contentious meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| I have absolute faith in neighborhoods to be able to make decisions for themselves based on their own infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12469)|
| 3:27:56| I don't think this is going to tear neighborhoods apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12476)|
| 3:27:58| I do think we have a process that's in place, and all we have to do is follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| And I would ask for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| Mr. Ernst, if you want to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12486)|
| 3:28:09| And now I'll call on Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| I don't have to say my name again, do I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12491)|
| 3:28:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12492)|
| 3:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12493)|
| 3:28:14| So, George, this is democracy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12494)|
| 3:28:17| So, we have an executive committee for West Hills, and we have a general meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12497)|
| 3:28:24| So, we would vote representing our neighborhood, just like you guys vote representing the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12504)|
| 3:28:32| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| You'd have to have each individual property owner come and say, I'm for this or I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12513)|
| 3:28:39| And if you don't reach them, then that's not a no or a yes vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12519)|
| 3:28:42| It's different than what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| It's one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| Gerald just said that you didn't have to have everybody's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12527)|
| 3:28:51| He just said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| But he also said if it's contentious and we can't come to an agreement, it's not based on the executive committee's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12533)|
| 3:29:00| It's based on the people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12540)|
| 3:29:02| It's not based on a small group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12542)|
| 3:29:05| I think if it was not based on the people in the neighborhood, we would not limit our outreach to the executive committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12545)|
| 3:29:11| or even the registered members of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| We would reach out to the owner of every property within the area that's designated for the potential E&O designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12555)|
| 3:29:23| And, Gerald, you and I have talked about this several times, and last we talked about it, you were supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12563)|
| 3:29:30| Is that still true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12570)|
| 3:29:31| That's a process that's available, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| I think it's a route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12573)|
| 3:29:34| I'm trying to, again, reach that point where we – please, everyone, to be quite frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12574)|
| 3:29:41| I'm thinking that by the time we finish the process, the neighborhood will realize that ADUs are not much of an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12581)|
| 3:29:47| and hopefully we can counter it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| But, you know, maybe that's because I'm even at this advanced stage, and after going through this, I'm still idealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12590)|
| 3:29:57| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12597)|
| 3:30:01| Glad to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12601)|
| 3:30:02| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12602)|
| 3:30:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12603)|
| 3:30:04| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12604)|
| 3:30:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12605)|
| 3:30:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12606)|
| 3:30:07| I found it interesting when you do a great job representing your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12607)|
| 3:30:12| You've done a lot of hard work, and I truly respect what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12612)|
| 3:30:15| It was interesting when you brought up that point that a lot of people –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| I noticed people in the audience who have been talking about property rights clap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12618)|
| 3:30:22| but it's an important aspect of property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12622)|
| 3:30:26| When you have property rights, so does your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12626)|
| 3:30:29| If a neighbor needed to build something because they had a relative who was in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12629)|
| 3:30:42| and the neighborhood chose to say, no, we don't want you to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12642)|
| 3:30:50| I don't think that's about taking care of your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12650)|
| 3:30:52| I think that's about taking care of your own needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12652)|
| 3:30:55| If there are infrastructure issues, that's something that's an issue all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12655)|
| 3:31:00| Population is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12660)|
| 3:31:02| Places are going to get denser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12662)|
| 3:31:04| That's not something that the council is doing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| It is happening already in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| We're trying to make accommodations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| I enjoy my lifestyle, but there's going to be changes in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12674)|
| 3:31:19| and I'm going to have to adapt and learn how to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| I very much respect – West Hills is a beautiful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| I do not believe that ADUs are going to pop up all over the place at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12686)|
| 3:31:31| I don't even know if many of these will happen during our lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12691)|
| 3:31:34| But I think looking into the future, it's something that we're going to need to make accommodations on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12694)|
| 3:31:39| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12699)|
| 3:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12704)|
| 3:31:45| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12705)|
| 3:31:46| Councilwoman, who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| Y'all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12708)|
| 3:31:50| We'll just work our way up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| Let me – back to what Councilman Wallace is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12712)|
| 3:31:56| a measurable way to figure out how many people in the neighborhood have actually been engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| I was on the Historic Zoning Commission for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12722)|
| 3:32:05| and we would get applications from various neighborhoods that wanted to have an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12725)|
| 3:32:10| We finally realized you can't just – you really have to figure out some way to take a neutral vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12730)|
| 3:32:19| not by the neighbors doing the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| but by somebody, in this case, from the Historic Zoning Commission operating that vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12741)|
| 3:32:27| so that everybody in that neighborhood was touched and had an opportunity to voice their opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12747)|
| 3:32:33| and to make a vote on it, a neutral vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12753)|
| 3:32:36| And that worked pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12756)|
| 3:32:38| It's not perfect, and it's really hard to get –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12758)|
| 3:32:41| but at some point you've got to come with some measurable, in my mind at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12761)|
| 3:32:46| something measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12766)|
| 3:32:47| And I'd say 60 to 75 percent of the neighbors really need to have a voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12767)|
| 3:32:53| not just represented by the executive committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12773)|
| 3:32:57| because we all know and we've all been involved in executive committees of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12777)|
| 3:33:04| that sometimes those quiet people in the neighborhood just don't have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12784)|
| 3:33:10| But they need to be heard from, and that's really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12790)|
| 3:33:13| And I agree with Councilwoman Singh that this is – I don't see this as a threat at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12793)|
| 3:33:21| And it's expensive enough that it probably isn't going to happen too often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12801)|
| 3:33:26| I'd be very surprised if it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12806)|
| 3:33:29| So I'm not comfortable with – if somebody wants to apply for an established neighborhood, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12809)|
| 3:33:39| But we need – that whole neighborhood needs to have a voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12819)|
| 3:33:43| and that's really hard to come up with some way to measure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12823)|
| 3:33:46| and make sure that everybody's had an opportunity to touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| I mean, that's similar to the process we're going through right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12832)|
| 3:33:53| And your analogy to the historic overlay is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12833)|
| 3:33:58| We're working with the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| We've done extensive outreach with community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| a committee of the neighborhood that's been very active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12844)|
| 3:34:07| placing flyers on everyone's doorstep, more community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12847)|
| 3:34:14| It's a long process, and we would use that process to ensure that everyone is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12854)|
| 3:34:20| in the designation of an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| We do have the process and realize how important it is for everyone to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12864)|
| 3:34:32| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12872)|
| 3:34:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12873)|
| 3:34:34| And I think part of my question has been answered through the question that Councilman Saunders asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12874)|
| 3:34:40| because I just want to make sure that there is an established process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12880)|
| 3:34:44| And so it sounds like, from what you just stated, that the onus will lie on your department to do the due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12884)|
| 3:34:51| to touch everyone in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| So let me ask, how does the process start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12893)|
| 3:34:56| Would it be that a neighbor applies for a special use on review, and then you notify the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12896)|
| 3:35:03| How does it start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| The process would start like we do a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12905)|
| 3:35:10| Again, use that analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12910)|
| 3:35:13| And Councilmember Campin brought forth to the Council a resolution asking the Council to support a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12913)|
| 3:35:22| asking the planning staff to work with the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12922)|
| 3:35:31| or study the application of either a neighborhood conservation or historic overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12931)|
| 3:35:37| And it's taken some time because of the outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| It's not a quick process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| But that resolution has to be sponsored by a member of the Council and then approved by the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12942)|
| 3:35:48| The planning staff, working with our planning commission, place it on our work program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12948)|
| 3:35:53| and assign a priority and get to it based on the resources available to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12953)|
| 3:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12960)|
| 3:36:01| So if a resident in one of these neighborhoods wanted to build an ADU, they would go to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12961)|
| 3:36:09| Oh, no, to build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you meant the established neighborhood process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12971)|
| 3:36:16| To build an ADU under the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12976)|
| 3:36:20| Yeah, so under this one, and you said it would mirror that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12980)|
| 3:36:24| are you saying that the person would have to come through their Councilmember for us to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12984)|
| 3:36:30| I misunderstood the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| I thought you were asking how an established neighborhood designation would be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12992)|
| 3:36:37| To build an ADU under the proposed ordinance, they would go submit their plans to the plans review office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=12997)|
| 3:36:44| The plans review office would review those plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13004)|
| 3:36:47| and make sure that they met the standards proposed in the ordinance, being smaller than principal unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13007)|
| 3:36:54| If it's an accessory building, being in the side yard or the backyard behind the principal structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13014)|
| 3:37:01| having a parking space, meeting all the building code requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13021)|
| 3:37:05| and then they would receive a permit and start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| There would be no notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13028)|
| 3:37:09| It's a permitted use and the residential district has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13029)|
| 3:37:13| Okay, but I'm sorry if I confused you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13033)|
| 3:37:17| No, I confused myself as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| Now, in what is proposed from Councilman Roberto, how would a neighbor start the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13039)|
| 3:37:27| And if we were to adopt this where the neighborhood sounds like kind of controls the decision to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13047)|
| 3:37:35| how do I as a neighbor, if I'm not a member of the neighborhood association and I wanted to build an ADU, how does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13055)|
| 3:37:41| If you're in an established neighborhood and it goes through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| Councilmember Roberto talked about as part of that process, their standard said no ADUs, then you cannot build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13065)|
| 3:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13075)|
| 3:37:56| So what we're saying is that in the ENs, that there would be no ADUs, no question, no appeal, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13076)|
| 3:38:05| If that's the standard that's approved as part of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13085)|
| 3:38:09| You have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13089)|
| 3:38:10| So when you establish your EN, when you decide you're going to start the process and become an EN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13090)|
| 3:38:15| during that process then you decide, if I understand what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13095)|
| 3:38:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13100)|
| 3:38:21| However that gets decided, it gets decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| And then if you're a neighbor, then you, if you live there, then you have to abide by what that decision was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13104)|
| 3:38:32| EN, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13112)|
| 3:38:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13113)|
| 3:38:34| That's what your proposal is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13114)|
| 3:38:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13115)|
| 3:38:36| So I currently live in an EN1, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13116)|
| 3:38:40| So if this is adopted, then I would not be able to build an accessory housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13120)|
| 3:38:46| No, it just would be, my understanding, it would be for new ENs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13126)|
| 3:38:49| It would be for new established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13129)|
| 3:38:50| Only for new ENs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13130)|
| 3:38:51| New ENs, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13131)|
| 3:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| And an EN could say we are going to allow ADUs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13137)|
| 3:38:58| The fact that you are an EN, I'm not taking a position on this, I'm just trying to clarify it, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13138)|
| 3:39:04| The fact that you are an EN doesn't determine whether or not you have ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13144)|
| 3:39:10| You have to, in the process, make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13150)|
| 3:39:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13154)|
| 3:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13155)|
| 3:39:16| I'm clear now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13156)|
| 3:39:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13157)|
| 3:39:18| And what about an established EN, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13158)|
| 3:39:21| A non-conforming EN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13161)|
| 3:39:22| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13162)|
| 3:39:23| If they wanted to change it, they'd have to do a new application because it says only for new applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13163)|
| 3:39:28| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| There's no reason to change existing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| So this is for new applications for an EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| That's what the proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13173)|
| 3:39:34| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13178)|
| 3:39:39| You know, I've been advocating for ADUs, I feel like, for the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13179)|
| 3:39:43| I think, you know, I'm supportive of it, but also understand, you know, Councilmember Roberto's done hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13183)|
| 3:39:49| And I think, you know, if this gets you a level of comfort, I'm willing to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13189)|
| 3:39:55| I think it's important to note, you know, the EN is already different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13195)|
| 3:39:58| You know, it doesn't allow duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| All the other residential zones do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13201)|
| 3:40:04| And so, you know, I'm okay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13204)|
| 3:40:07| And then, you know, when these applications come up, you know, we can look at it and decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| Our future councils can decide whether it makes sense for it to be ADUs by right or special use or no ADUs at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13212)|
| 3:40:22| And, you know, I think if that provides comfort, then we should go ahead and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13222)|
| 3:40:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13229)|
| 3:40:30| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13230)|
| 3:40:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13232)|
| 3:40:34| I want to support Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| I understand part of what's been hard for me with this whole process is my district's very—my district is different within itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13237)|
| 3:40:46| but my district is incredibly different from his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| My district as a whole is one of the districts with the majority of the legal nonconforming lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13248)|
| 3:40:54| In 1963, the majority of my neighborhoods—I think it's fair to say a large majority of our lots became legal nonconforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13254)|
| 3:41:03| when the previous zoning code that we're discussing got passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| I don't know where all the protesters were when that got passed, but nobody cared because we were the area of town everybody was leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13266)|
| 3:41:14| Now everybody wants to live there, and by God, we shouldn't have to go pay for variances to do everything we want to do or fill the lot in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13274)|
| 3:41:22| And we'd like to rebuild Broadway and Central and not live in urban decay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13282)|
| 3:41:27| So, you know, I'm not trying to change their neighborhood to make my neighborhoods right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13287)|
| 3:41:33| and I'm not trying to change Fountain City to something they don't want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13293)|
| 3:41:37| And this has been the most contentious point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13297)|
| 3:41:40| I don't think it's going to happen as wholesale, but I think Ian's already been set up to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13300)|
| 3:41:45| It doesn't allow duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| We have made a lot of concessions for ADUs along this process, and I don't agree with all those concessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13307)|
| 3:41:54| but I'm going with them because they've been—you know, they've made it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13314)|
| 3:42:00| I don't agree with the owner-occupied component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13320)|
| 3:42:03| I think it should be use by right review or special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13323)|
| 3:42:08| Use on review, special use, instead of owner-occupied to pull a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13328)|
| 3:42:15| I don't think that's going to hold out in the long run, but it was a concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13335)|
| 3:42:20| And this takes this off the table for these neighborhoods, so I'll support you in this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13340)|
| 3:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13346)|
| 3:42:27| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13347)|
| 3:42:28| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13348)|
| 3:42:29| Well, I think you also got to look past the current homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13349)|
| 3:42:34| I mean, the current homeowners are deciding, and they're deciding for into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13354)|
| 3:42:39| I mean, you go forward, and I'm going to call on Tim Hill to talk about this in Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13359)|
| 3:42:45| It's been problematic in old Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13365)|
| 3:42:51| It wasn't problematic when those people signed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13371)|
| 3:42:54| They were in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13374)|
| 3:42:55| But new property owners coming in are now left with different restrictions than they even know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13375)|
| 3:43:02| And so, you know, going out, you're allowing people to subset and create different zones within a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13382)|
| 3:43:08| I think long term, it does affect the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13388)|
| 3:43:12| I mean, you say, well, I'm in an EN, and I just want you to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13392)|
| 3:43:16| I think that would be a property, a disclosure that you would have to make going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13396)|
| 3:43:22| I'm selling this property, but I'm in an EN that doesn't allow ADs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13402)|
| 3:43:27| I mean, that would be a real something of value that you'd have to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13407)|
| 3:43:32| So, Tim Hill, I called on you last time and talked about it in old Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13412)|
| 3:43:37| Do you want to talk about it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13417)|
| 3:43:38| I mean, you live there, and you've lived with some of those restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13418)|
| 3:43:43| Tim Hill, 311 South Wise Garber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| You know, I think probably the point of focus should be on if you're going to follow Mr. Councilman Roberto's offer here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13425)|
| 3:43:56| that you really need to solidify the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13436)|
| 3:44:00| I would say ours, we are R1EN2, and I went through that entire process, and it was informal at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13440)|
| 3:44:11| When we said, how many votes do we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13451)|
| 3:44:14| How do you draft a ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| You know, that's as important to get people to agree to something as how you draft the ballot to try to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13458)|
| 3:44:25| Mr. Donaldson at the time said, well, we think probably 75% is a good measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13465)|
| 3:44:32| I don't think we ever took a formal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| What we did, we made it so, I guess, watered down that we had no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13475)|
| 3:44:42| So, in the EN2, I think we only had about three components that we wanted wide or lot widths to be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13482)|
| 3:44:54| We wanted our setbacks to be more, I guess, standard or, I guess, uniform is what I'm looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13494)|
| 3:45:03| and that we wanted parcels larger than three acres to be dealt with in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13503)|
| 3:45:10| So, you know, I hear EN, you want to be unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13510)|
| 3:45:15| That's the nature of EN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13515)|
| 3:45:17| You want to have your own set of standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13517)|
| 3:45:22| But I think the most important thing is that you need to know what that standard is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13522)|
| 3:45:27| and is it 75% or is it just the will of the association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13527)|
| 3:45:33| I'll tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| I don't care if it's 75, 85, 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13535)|
| 3:45:39| I want to give one personal experience, and that is my 83-year-old mother is not in the best of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13539)|
| 3:45:47| and we had a choice to put her in a rest home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13547)|
| 3:45:50| or my sister offered to convert her garage on Lona's Road to an apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13550)|
| 3:45:56| and she said if I would pay for it that she would take the time and the efforts to care for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13556)|
| 3:46:01| And we built it, and I'm not sure it's legal, but those were the options that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13561)|
| 3:46:07| and I'll deal with whatever comes after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13567)|
| 3:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13570)|
| 3:46:11| You may have just been too frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| What was that address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13576)|
| 3:46:19| What was the name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13581)|
| 3:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13582)|
| 3:46:24| Okay, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13584)|
| 3:46:26| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| Who would have ever thought that little tiny houses would create such a big stir, and this certainly has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13588)|
| 3:46:34| This is just one of those issues that nobody is ever going to completely agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13594)|
| 3:46:38| and there are lots of really good points on all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13598)|
| 3:46:42| I happen to land on the side of believing that allowing property owners the ability to do an ADU is something that we should permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13602)|
| 3:46:52| I want to clarify a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13612)|
| 3:46:55| So I understand EN, there's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| It's not necessarily well defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13618)|
| 3:47:02| However, there is a process, and it's been in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13622)|
| 3:47:06| This would only apply to new applications for EN neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13626)|
| 3:47:10| So existing EN would have to submit a new application if they would like to have ADUs exempted from their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13630)|
| 3:47:20| They may have a quicker process because it may be just amending their current standards to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13640)|
| 3:47:26| but that would still be the public process with outreach to all the property owners and residents within that established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13646)|
| 3:47:33| Got it, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13653)|
| 3:47:34| And so is there a process in place if an EN neighborhood wants to repeal their EN designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13654)|
| 3:47:42| So down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13662)|
| 3:47:45| That would be a zoning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| It would be a zoning, basically a zoning change from EN to RN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13667)|
| 3:47:52| I'm being idealistic again and thinking about the new zoning order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13672)|
| 3:47:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| Currently it could be from EN to R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13678)|
| 3:48:03| And it would be a zoning amendment that would come through the Planning Commission and then through the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13683)|
| 3:48:08| Is there a mechanism for that to be initiated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13688)|
| 3:48:12| There's the amendment, zoning amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| Process, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13695)|
| 3:48:16| Once a neighborhood is designated as EN, how is that information about what the restrictions that Mr. Hill discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13696)|
| 3:48:29| how are those communicated or understood by the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13709)|
| 3:48:33| So if I bought a house in an EN neighborhood, is it on the zoning map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13713)|
| 3:48:37| It's on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| And all good realtors tell their clients what the zoning of their property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13720)|
| 3:48:46| and gives them a copy of the zoning ordinance and my direct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13726)|
| 3:48:50| All right, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13730)|
| 3:48:52| So I know it may say EN on the zoning map, but it sounds like every EN neighborhood has a different set of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13732)|
| 3:49:01| There's different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13741)|
| 3:49:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13742)|
| 3:49:03| So is that identifiable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13743)|
| 3:49:06| That's in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13746)|
| 3:49:08| Identifiable in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13748)|
| 3:49:11| By neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13751)|
| 3:49:12| By neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13752)|
| 3:49:14| The property owner would look at the zoning map that's available online on the Knox Planning website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13754)|
| 3:49:22| then look for their zoning designation, go to the zoning ordinance that's also on the Knox Planning website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13762)|
| 3:49:29| go down to residential districts, look at the EN or the EN1 or the EN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13769)|
| 3:49:35| and look at the standards within that zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| Or they could call our office and ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13778)|
| 3:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| Okay, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13782)|
| 3:49:43| Okay, so last thing, and I know this goes without saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13783)|
| 3:49:47| but I just want to be clear that even if Councilman Roberto's amendment is voted in by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13787)|
| 3:49:58| and it becomes part of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13798)|
| 3:50:02| we'll still be adopting a zoning ordinance that allows ADUs in all existing residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13802)|
| 3:50:08| All existing residential districts as of the date of the adoption of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13808)|
| 3:50:12| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13812)|
| 3:50:14| Okay, so I think that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13814)|
| 3:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13816)|
| 3:50:17| Well, I will also just concur with Councilwoman Ryder that I'm not crazy about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13817)|
| 3:50:26| but I do appreciate the work that Councilman Roberto has put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13826)|
| 3:50:30| and I think this has been a process that is full of compromise that's part of policy development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13830)|
| 3:50:38| And so this particular case, I would be willing to support Councilman Roberto's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13838)|
| 3:50:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13844)|
| 3:50:46| All right, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13846)|
| 3:50:50| Would it increase people's level of comfort to set a standard as part of this to say it needs to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13850)|
| 3:50:58| do you want me to be quiet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13858)|
| 3:51:00| No, I would just say this, rather than, let's stay on track tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13860)|
| 3:51:05| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13865)|
| 3:51:06| I think the appropriate time to set that standard is when Councilmember Roberto brings a resolution before the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13866)|
| 3:51:15| to designate, to ask the planning staff to work with West Hills to designate, to look at EN designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13875)|
| 3:51:24| At that point, the Council can say, you need 78.9% of the property owners to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13884)|
| 3:51:30| And let's do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13890)|
| 3:51:31| Let's save it until it's needed instead of going off on detour numbers 962 tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13891)|
| 3:51:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13899)|
| 3:51:40| All right, I was going to throw out a number, but I won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13900)|
| 3:51:43| But I will say that some of the things that have been said here, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13903)|
| 3:51:48| these are decisions made by the current property owners, not potential future owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13908)|
| 3:51:53| when we talk about having to be owner-occupied to build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13913)|
| 3:51:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13917)|
| 3:51:58| Enough said on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13918)|
| 3:51:59| Secondly, many of the things you've said apply to and can easily be said about the H1 overlay, which I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13919)|
| 3:52:07| And I'll be forthcoming, and I was, I've always been forthcoming about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13927)|
| 3:52:11| We specifically sought a home with an H1 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13931)|
| 3:52:14| I did not want to live anywhere without that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13934)|
| 3:52:17| I came from the country from a trailer in the middle of nowhere is where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| But then when I lived in the city, I developed an appreciation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13942)|
| 3:52:26| And I saw, you know, the positivity of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13946)|
| 3:52:29| And I still believe in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| And realtors are not forthcoming about that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13951)|
| 3:52:34| And people buy into our neighborhood, and they don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13954)|
| 3:52:37| Stephanie lived on my street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13957)|
| 3:52:38| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13958)|
| 3:52:39| She's lived in Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13959)|
| 3:52:40| I don't know what their designation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13960)|
| 3:52:42| But people don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13962)|
| 3:52:44| I didn't know this when I got a mortgage and I bought this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13964)|
| 3:52:47| that I can't come out and rip all this stuff off and change this and rent a bulldozer and so forth and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13967)|
| 3:52:54| And so, you know, anyway, similarities and parallels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13974)|
| 3:52:59| Vote your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13979)|
| 3:53:00| I'm voting my conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13980)|
| 3:53:01| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13981)|
| 3:53:05| Do you need a cookie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13985)|
| 3:53:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13986)|
| 3:53:08| Lots of agreement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13988)|
| 3:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| Okay, so this was really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13990)|
| 3:53:13| Again, like the previous long discussion, we have many different opinions in this community about ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=13993)|
| 3:53:23| and where they're appropriate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| And this is another example of where good and reasonable people disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14005)|
| 3:53:29| And so it comes down to, in our democracy, a vote by council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14009)|
| 3:53:34| So we have the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14014)|
| 3:53:36| Everyone knows what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14016)|
| 3:53:38| Can you recall the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| Mayor, if I may, I have made a slight change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| Okay, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14022)|
| 3:53:43| You were going to update it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14023)|
| 3:53:44| So let's read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14024)|
| 3:53:45| What does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14025)|
| 3:53:46| Can you read it out loud for those of us who can't see in the distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14029)|
| 3:53:50| So the entire section will now say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14030)|
| 3:53:51| An ADU may be located only on a lot with one single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14031)|
| 3:53:56| However, in EN districts, ADUs shall be permitted only if the neighborhood so designates in a new EN application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14036)|
| 3:54:03| One of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14043)|
| 3:54:07| That's what you are proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14047)|
| 3:54:10| And we have a second on that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14050)|
| 3:54:14| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14054)|
| 3:54:15| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14057)|
| 3:54:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14058)|
| 3:54:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14059)|
| 3:54:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14060)|
| 3:54:21| Okay, let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14063)|
| 3:54:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14064)|
| 3:54:26| Vice Mayor Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14066)|
| 3:54:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14067)|
| 3:54:28| Councilman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14068)|
| 3:54:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14069)|
| 3:54:30| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14070)|
| 3:54:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14072)|
| 3:54:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14073)|
| 3:54:34| Councilman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14074)|
| 3:54:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14075)|
| 3:54:36| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14076)|
| 3:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14077)|
| 3:54:38| Councilman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14078)|
| 3:54:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14079)|
| 3:54:40| Councilman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14080)|
| 3:54:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14081)|
| 3:54:42| Passes 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14082)|
| 3:54:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14083)|
| 3:54:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14085)|
| 3:54:46| Very good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14086)|
| 3:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14087)|
| 3:54:48| Okay, so are there other council-initiated amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14088)|
| 3:55:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14101)|
| 3:55:02| I may have a simple question, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14102)|
| 3:55:05| If you'll remind us how we got here to the RN2 minimum square foot designation, the 5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14105)|
| 3:55:11| versus the 7,000, because it's been requested that the minimum be 7,000 square feet and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14111)|
| 3:55:16| not 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14116)|
| 3:55:18| We found a number of lots that were below 7,000 square feet and did not want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14118)|
| 3:55:22| those lots nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14122)|
| 3:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14125)|
| 3:55:28| So we have the case of, again, trying to reach some balance, not too many zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14128)|
| 3:55:35| but zoning districts to accommodate the variety of lot sizes we have in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14135)|
| 3:55:42| And I think one of the provision, I'm trying to find my list, but for future, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14142)|
| 3:55:51| for the stakeholders to review, the number one is, is there a need for another residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14151)|
| 3:55:58| neighborhood district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14158)|
| 3:56:00| And that's something we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14160)|
| 3:56:01| We fine-tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| One of the amendments to the maps that was identified by Councilmember Ryder was to fine-tune| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14163)|
| 3:56:11| some, especially in the Adair Gardens area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14171)|
| 3:56:14| And we went in and took a laser and basically in crafting the zoning districts, the revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14174)|
| 3:56:23| zoning districts there to look at the lot sizes and make sure we were not contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14183)|
| 3:56:28| to the transition of that neighborhood to something else, preserving those larger lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14188)|
| 3:56:35| and not allowing them to be subdivided into smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14195)|
| 3:56:39| So doing some of that and aggressively looking at the need for another zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14199)|
| 3:56:44| After the adoption of this code, we can address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14204)|
| 3:56:47| I don't think that the market in Knoxville is hot enough right now to take some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14207)|
| 3:56:53| And I live close to Adair Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14213)|
| 3:56:55| They have beautiful homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14215)|
| 3:56:56| To take those beautiful homes, it's not to the point that those homes are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14216)|
| 3:57:01| bought, demolished, and two lots created out of one, especially with the fine-tuning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14221)|
| 3:57:06| the zoning ordinance that Councilmember Ryder's amendment would result in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14226)|
| 3:57:13| So what is the detriment of having a 7,000-square-foot minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14233)|
| 3:57:17| It doesn't allow more development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14237)|
| 3:57:20| Well, in order to build on some of the existing lots in the older neighborhood, there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14240)|
| 3:57:27| be a need for variances, both lot size, likely lot coverage, lot setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14247)|
| 3:57:37| It's what we're trying to get away from now with our uniform 7,500-square-foot minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14257)|
| 3:57:43| We've got a number of lots that are not conforming under our existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14263)|
| 3:57:47| We want to continue that with our new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14270)|
| 3:57:52| Ms. Malone or Larry, does anybody want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14272)|
| 3:57:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14277)|
| 3:57:59| Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| And boy, I appreciate you bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14281)|
| 3:58:03| And I appreciate the fact that you respect the character of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14283)|
| 3:58:08| In Fountain City, we have a lot of older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14288)|
| 3:58:12| Adair Gardens is an excellent example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14292)|
| 3:58:15| But it's an example, and this is throughout the city, in older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14295)|
| 3:58:21| What you have to realize is, for decades, 7,500 square feet was the minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14301)|
| 3:58:30| for a single-family home in R1, R1E, R1A, and R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14310)|
| 3:58:39| So for a single-family home, minimum lot size, 7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14319)|
| 3:58:47| Draft 1 of RECODE said minimum lot size for basically R1 and R1E will go up to 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14327)|
| 3:58:58| It also said, so RN1 would be 10,000, bigger than the 7,500 presently required for a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14338)|
| 3:59:11| And at the same time, it said RN2, minimum lot size, 7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14351)|
| 3:59:16| That's what Draft 1 said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14356)|
| 3:59:19| But Draft 2 said 10,000 for RN1, no longer 7,000, but 5,000 for RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14359)|
| 3:59:31| Here's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| A lot of, because of the decades of 7,500 minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14373)|
| 3:59:40| these changes and the big gap between 10,000 and 5,000 means that every lot that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14380)|
| 3:59:48| with a single-family home in the city of Knoxville that was close to the 7,500 minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14388)|
| 3:59:56| for a single-family home, again, R1, R1A, R1E, R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14396)|
| 4:00:02| every lot that was developed around 7,500 cannot be RN1 because now that's 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14402)|
| 4:00:09| It's got to be RN2, which is 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14409)|
| 4:00:13| Now, I'm not Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| I don't have my hand on the pulse of the real estate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14416)|
| 4:00:21| But I know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| I represented Adair Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| They were R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14425)|
| 4:00:27| They went to R1 after a 12-year battle with commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14427)|
| 4:00:32| They are a triangular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14432)|
| 4:00:35| They have provided affordable, good housing in a stable community for 50, 60, 70, 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14435)|
| 4:00:47| Many of the houses are two-bedroom, one-bath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14447)|
| 4:00:51| Some are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| Some of the lots are over 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| Some are as small as seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14455)|
| 4:00:58| And it's one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14458)|
| 4:01:01| What we are doing by having a 10,000-square-foot lot minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14461)|
| 4:01:07| and a 5,000 with nothing in between after decades of 7,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14467)|
| 4:01:13| is bringing about incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14473)|
| 4:01:20| whether it's in Adair Gardens or someplace else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14480)|
| 4:01:23| to combine lots and come up with the tall, skinnies and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14483)|
| 4:01:28| that are out of character with the rest of the housing stock in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14488)|
| 4:01:32| I think there is an absolute need for a 7,000-square-foot neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14492)|
| 4:01:39| a 7,000-square-foot zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14499)|
| 4:01:43| If it's not the RN2 district, let it be the RN1A district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14503)|
| 4:01:50| You have 22,000 for EN, 10,000 minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14510)|
| 4:01:56| 10,000 for RN1, and then you drop down to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14516)|
| 4:02:03| Making every bit of housing stock that's less than $9,999 five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14523)|
| 4:02:11| What do you think the impact is on our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14531)|
| 4:02:14| It's going to be devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14534)|
| 4:02:16| In some places, it will be more than enough incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14536)|
| 4:02:20| to bring about the quick-fix developer who comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14540)|
| 4:02:26| puts some property together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14546)|
| 4:02:29| throws up tall, skinnies or whatever housing that doesn't meet with the rest of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14549)|
| 4:02:37| making the cost of the housing more expensive than the existing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14557)|
| 4:02:41| so it's not helping affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14561)|
| 4:02:44| and leaves looking at us from the rear-view mirror of his car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14564)|
| 4:02:49| Now, to say that we can come back and tweak it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14569)|
| 4:02:52| you can't tweak it after it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14572)|
| 4:02:55| This is not something that can wait a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14575)|
| 4:03:00| You pass this with 10,000 and 5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14580)|
| 4:03:05| there's no way you can stop the changes that take place until you get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14585)|
| 4:03:10| They will be grandfathered in, and that will be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14590)|
| 4:03:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14594)|
| 4:03:19| And I'm sorry that I don't have the image of doom and gloom that was just shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14599)|
| 4:03:23| I think we can address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| We've addressed it some through fine-tuning of mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14605)|
| 4:03:28| and it is at number one on the list of the issues to be addressed by the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14608)|
| 4:03:33| If you look at the council-initiated packet on page 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14613)|
| 4:03:36| the first item for future discussion or possible action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14616)|
| 4:03:40| Councilwoman Ryder brought up back on May 14th, that is on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14620)|
| 4:03:45| So it's something that is ready to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14625)|
| 4:03:54| I just wanted to say, and I'll call on Mr. Dearing if he wants to say something after I say my piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14634)|
| 4:04:00| I brought it up on May 14th, and the question that I posed was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14640)|
| 4:04:04| what Councilwoman Campin just brought up was, did we need an in-between district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14644)|
| 4:04:09| And I didn't get support, so that's why it ended up on this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14649)|
| 4:04:14| It didn't go any further than me bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14654)|
| 4:04:17| I hear what former Councilwoman Malone says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14657)|
| 4:04:21| In regards to rows and coil, by the way, I've got modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14661)|
| 4:04:27| because I think I left a few pieces off of that, of my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14667)|
| 4:04:31| But that triangle there, I do think there is the economics at this very moment to make them very vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14671)|
| 4:04:38| They just lost a house in the last few months, particularly when you start from the fringes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14678)|
| 4:04:45| I think, you know, they stand to go the way that the Bearden Village houses went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14685)|
| 4:04:49| A lot of those are still standing, but they're commercial, okay, so they're still standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14689)|
| 4:04:53| But some of the ones on the fringes aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14693)|
| 4:04:55| They've been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14695)|
| 4:04:56| There's a recent infill there on Sutherland where they're torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| We have tons of these neighborhoods with these small houses that have been working class houses all along on small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14699)|
| 4:05:06| And that's what I did was go through and took feedback from various people to give them neutral zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14706)|
| 4:05:13| which is what my list and what I discussed that is included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14713)|
| 4:05:18| But I very much am in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14718)|
| 4:05:22| For me to support recode and the map for Mr. Deering's section there between Broadway and Jacksboro needs to be solidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14722)|
| 4:05:31| Yeah, and today when I emailed you is I can't see what you guys had gone through and designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14731)|
| 4:05:38| These are the areas where the lots would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14738)|
| 4:05:42| The recommendation based on your direction is to change these lots from RN2 to RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14742)|
| 4:05:49| And this would address the bigger issue that both you and Ms. Malone addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14749)|
| 4:05:54| seemed to be the conversion of these residential zone to office or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14754)|
| 4:06:02| And what we're trying to do with the recode is to allow more intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14762)|
| 4:06:08| and a wider variety of uses of those corridors and thereby protect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14768)|
| 4:06:13| Whether this is RN1 or EN or special district, residential district number nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14773)|
| 4:06:20| doesn't matter if council does not support the residential zoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14780)|
| 4:06:25| That seemed to be, you just mentioned it would go the way of the Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14785)|
| 4:06:30| That's not splitting them up and building tall and skinnies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14790)|
| 4:06:34| That's converting to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14794)|
| 4:06:36| What Ms. Malone talked about was the commercial pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14796)|
| 4:06:39| This protects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14799)|
| 4:06:41| And I think we've done enough to protect this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14801)|
| 4:06:46| In some, we made lots non-conforming because they don't meet the 10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14806)|
| 4:06:52| but we thought the broader application of the RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14812)|
| 4:06:54| We don't have an in-between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14814)|
| 4:06:55| We have no option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14815)|
| 4:06:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14816)|
| 4:06:57| And I will agree with you, and I have responded back to Mr. Dearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14817)|
| 4:07:01| and in conversation with Ms. Malone, that the best protection for the structures is H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14821)|
| 4:07:08| Obviously, I've made it clear here that I'm a believer in that tool and the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14828)|
| 4:07:13| Earlier we discussed that at a community meeting two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14833)|
| 4:07:18| Meeting you or you and them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14838)|
| 4:07:20| I think you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14840)|
| 4:07:22| I don't think you were even a council member yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14842)|
| 4:07:24| but we did talk about that with the Adair Gardens community group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14844)|
| 4:07:29| So I think it takes initiative from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14849)|
| 4:07:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14852)|
| 4:07:33| And I've told them I support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14853)|
| 4:07:34| and I've told them I understand that's the only tool that we have in the toolbox to avoid demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14854)|
| 4:07:38| Lot size is not the only tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14858)|
| 4:07:41| I also understand that playing around with the lot size is particularly in this very vulnerable spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14861)|
| 4:07:46| which you have been amenable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14866)|
| 4:07:48| So, yes, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14868)|
| 4:07:51| Well, I just, if you don't mind me interjecting before Mr. Dearing speaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14871)|
| 4:07:56| I brought this up because of Oakwood-Lincoln Park as well as a bunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14876)|
| 4:07:59| and I know, Gerald, there's going to be an overarching plan in the future for Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14879)|
| 4:08:05| There's just concerns about these issues we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14885)|
| 4:08:08| So I just want to make sure Adair Gardens and Oakwood-Lincoln Park can be looked at and protected better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14888)|
| 4:08:13| Oakwood-Lincoln Park is making a giant step with recode as it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14893)|
| 4:08:17| because they're going from R2 multifamily up to as many as 30 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14897)|
| 4:08:23| if you buy enough acreage, to RN2, which addresses most of their lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14903)|
| 4:08:30| range between 6,000 square feet and 8,000 or 9,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14910)|
| 4:08:35| So most of them would not meet the, unless someone owns a double lot, would meet the RN1 standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14915)|
| 4:08:40| So we're really, I think we've made a giant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14920)|
| 4:08:42| I think the double lots is of concern as well, just slicing up other lots and continuing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14922)|
| 4:08:48| And that's, you know, regardless of what your minimum lot size is, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14928)|
| 4:08:53| In West Hills, you can buy three lots and make, well, probably at half acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14933)|
| 4:08:59| you could buy two lots and create four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14939)|
| 4:09:03| Under the RN1 designation, currently you can make five lots out of that one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14943)|
| 4:09:10| So we've got, we have that issue because we don't have 25 zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14950)|
| 4:09:15| for the 25 unique neighborhoods that we have in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14955)|
| 4:09:20| If I could just clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14960)|
| 4:09:22| I was not talking about commercial pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14962)|
| 4:09:24| I'm talking about, and if that's what you heard, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14964)|
| 4:09:30| I'm talking about pressure to turn into tall skinnies and so on like that are not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14970)|
| 4:09:38| The other thing is, and I support historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14978)|
| 4:09:47| I was a member of council when Old North got its historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14987)|
| 4:09:52| And it was part of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14992)|
| 4:09:56| I also supported Dare Gardens, which if you're interested in zoning neutrality, is R1 at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=14996)|
| 4:10:04| And they worked very hard for over a decade to put themselves in a position to be stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15004)|
| 4:10:11| and to have R1 zoning, which has stabilized and has protected that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15011)|
| 4:10:17| which is really all they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15017)|
| 4:10:22| They should try to get historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15022)|
| 4:10:24| And part of it is on the national register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15024)|
| 4:10:26| They should try to get historic zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15026)|
| 4:10:28| But at some point, and at the risk of really making everyone mad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15028)|
| 4:10:33| at some point we need to be able to say to the citizens of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15033)|
| 4:10:39| we'll protect what you have and what you have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15039)|
| 4:10:43| And we are not going to put it on you to do just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15043)|
| 4:10:48| Okay, thanks, Ms. Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15048)|
| 4:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15049)|
| 4:10:50| We have a question for Mr. Deering now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15050)|
| 4:10:55| Larry Deering, 200 Adair Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15055)|
| 4:10:59| And, yes, commercial intrusion right now is not our biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15059)|
| 4:11:02| It's with the recoding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15062)|
| 4:11:04| It's the combining of lots and tearing down houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15064)|
| 4:11:07| and totally changing the desirability, the livability of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15067)|
| 4:11:13| And legislation should not be passed based on whoever's hand is on the pulse of anything at the moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15073)|
| 4:11:20| and whatever kind of immediate demand there may or may not be for ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15080)|
| 4:11:24| or for tearing down houses and building more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15084)|
| 4:11:28| We need to pass legislation based on what may be unleashed when Pandora's Box is opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15088)|
| 4:11:35| what can happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15095)|
| 4:11:39| The main thing I wanted to address tonight, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15099)|
| 4:11:41| was to be sure that all of Adair Gardens was included in the RN-1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15101)|
| 4:11:48| not just the three streets that are mentioned here on this paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15108)|
| 4:11:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15111)|
| 4:11:52| It goes down below that, even though the streets aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15112)|
| 4:11:54| All the way through Rose and Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15114)|
| 4:11:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15115)|
| 4:11:56| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15116)|
| 4:11:57| And every lot that approached 10,000 square feet, we made RN-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15117)|
| 4:12:02| And you can't see down because your timer is up, and sorry to interrupt you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15122)|
| 4:12:06| but I'll be happy to meet with you and look over the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15126)|
| 4:12:10| We really went in and drew lines, did more piecemeal than my Teutonic nature would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15130)|
| 4:12:19| but I think it works for your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15139)|
| 4:12:22| Thank you, and thank you, Ms. Ryder, and thank you, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15142)|
| 4:12:26| But there are many other neighborhoods who are not as vocal as Adair Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15146)|
| 4:12:30| who are in the same fragile situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15150)|
| 4:12:33| And we are a small, fragile neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15153)|
| 4:12:37| Many older neighborhoods are fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15157)|
| 4:12:40| And I want to echo what Ms. Malone said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15160)|
| 4:12:42| I have been working since I moved into the neighborhood in 1986 to get the RN-1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15162)|
| 4:12:48| to maintain the stability of the neighborhood, and it has always been fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15168)|
| 4:12:53| We have always had to fight, and neighborhoods should not have to fight for their continued existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15173)|
| 4:13:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15180)|
| 4:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15181)|
| 4:13:08| So we've had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15188)|
| 4:13:10| Other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15190)|
| 4:13:13| Well, I mean, I don't feel like I'm going to have a lot of support here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15193)|
| 4:13:16| I mean, I can propose an RN-2 zone 7,000 square foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15196)|
| 4:13:21| I just need to hear from my colleagues if I've got any support to do such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15201)|
| 4:13:28| Pen drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15208)|
| 4:13:31| I need to ask Gerald if that was something that would be considered by MPC in its previous two visits to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15211)|
| 4:13:43| They heard the request and did no, they did not ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15223)|
| 4:13:54| They felt that creating a 7,000 square foot would make too many lots nonconforming, the smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15234)|
| 4:14:03| And Oakwood, Lincoln Park, others, create the same problem that we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15243)|
| 4:14:07| with older lots and older neighborhoods not meeting the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15247)|
| 4:14:12| So instead, as Councilmember Ryder requested, in this neighborhood we've looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15252)|
| 4:14:19| We've looked at neighborhoods throughout the city and tried to do a finer tune of RN-1 and RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15259)|
| 4:14:25| So it sounds like what you're telling me is that we can show on the record that that was a subject that was considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15265)|
| 4:14:33| among many others, by the MPC, so it wouldn't have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15273)|
| 4:14:37| So this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| And again, it is the number one item on the stakeholder, for the stakeholders to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15279)|
| 4:14:45| Given that, if the new zoning ordinance is adopted as it is, staff will start looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15285)|
| 4:14:52| even as we wait for the implementation of the new zoning ordinance and starting to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15292)|
| 4:14:58| That would be top priority on the priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15298)|
| 4:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15301)|
| 4:15:02| Again, just back to Oakwood, Lincoln Park and the stabilization of the larger single family residential chunks, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15302)|
| 4:15:08| The plan that you all have been working on for so long will help stave off slicing and dicing of larger lots to build tall skinnies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15308)|
| 4:15:17| as Ms. Malone put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| The historic overlay would address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15319)|
| 4:15:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15322)|
| 4:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15323)|
| 4:15:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15324)|
| 4:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15325)|
| 4:15:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15326)|
| 4:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15327)|
| 4:15:28| Did you want to say anything else, Mr. Daring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15328)|
| 4:15:29| Very briefly, and I will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15329)|
| 4:15:31| I'm 71 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15331)|
| 4:15:32| I'd like to leave here above ground and vertical tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15332)|
| 4:15:36| Nonconforming should not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15336)|
| 4:15:38| We have many properties that have been for years nonconforming in Adair Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15338)|
| 4:15:43| It has not been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15343)|
| 4:15:44| I don't see that being a problem in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15344)|
| 4:15:46| I think that is a nonissue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15346)|
| 4:15:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15348)|
| 4:15:50| Okay, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15350)|
| 4:15:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15352)|
| 4:15:55| I would be inclined to support the idea of having another residential zone, because what we're looking at is combining R1, R1E, and R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15355)|
| 4:16:06| And so I've expressed that before, and I think that is something we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15366)|
| 4:16:10| I'm very concerned with what Councilman Campin has brought up, and I know Councilwoman Ryder has discussed as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15370)|
| 4:16:18| because I think you really do run the risk of having an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15378)|
| 4:16:24| And so what I want to ask Gerald is, are they protected from the issue by what is going to be proposed in the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15384)|
| 4:16:35| or should we look at what Councilmember Campin just said with regard to changing the minimum lot size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15395)|
| 4:16:45| something closer to what it is currently, because clearly what it is currently isn't creating this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15405)|
| 4:16:52| So can we do no harm by not making a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15412)|
| 4:16:57| In this neighborhood and many neighborhoods where we've gone in and better defined the RN1 and RN2, that will address the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15417)|
| 4:17:06| Did we catch everyone, or is there an opportunity for someone to buy three lots and create four or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15426)|
| 4:17:13| That exists throughout the city because of the variety of lot sizes we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15433)|
| 4:17:19| So the question is, do we try to address that issue everywhere, and how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15439)|
| 4:17:28| If we increase the minimum lot size in RN1 or RN2 from 5,000 to 7,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15448)|
| 4:17:36| and back some time ago we had the numbers of how many additional nonconforming lots would be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15456)|
| 4:17:42| It was substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15462)|
| 4:17:44| And do you want to, every time someone wants to do, and Peter is better aware of this than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15464)|
| 4:17:50| at what level do they have to obtain a variance to do work on their house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15470)|
| 4:17:56| Do you want to address one issue and create a bigger one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15476)|
| 4:18:00| That's a question that is a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15480)|
| 4:18:03| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15483)|
| 4:18:05| I think, again, that what we've done, finer tuning, more finely tuning the mapping, addresses the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15485)|
| 4:18:12| Having that creation of a new zoning district is the number one priority for the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15492)|
| 4:18:18| Give staff direction to start working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15498)|
| 4:18:21| As soon as this code is adopted and we catch up on the other things that have been ignored while we work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15501)|
| 4:18:28| then we'll have a new zoning district prepared for the first meeting of the Stakeholders Review Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15508)|
| 4:18:34| the first of next year, and have them review it and send it on to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15514)|
| 4:18:39| So just to make sure I'm clear, you believe that the changes that have been proposed for the map will protect what's been brought up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15519)|
| 4:18:48| This protects Adair Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15528)|
| 4:18:50| We've also, going from Map 3 to Map 4, more finely tuned the RN1 and RN2 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15530)|
| 4:18:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15538)|
| 4:18:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15539)|
| 4:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15540)|
| 4:19:02| Any other issues like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15542)|
| 4:19:08| Okay, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15548)|
| 4:19:09| So we have basically gone page by page, word by word, through this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15549)|
| 4:19:17| We have voted, I don't know how many times you all have voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15557)|
| 4:19:20| Sixteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15560)|
| 4:19:23| Sixteen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15563)|
| 4:19:25| Today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15565)|
| 4:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15567)|
| 4:19:28| But through multiple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15568)|
| 4:19:29| Overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15569)|
| 4:19:30| Many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15570)|
| 4:19:31| Many hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15571)|
| 4:19:32| It's a very thorough review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15572)|
| 4:19:34| As I said earlier today at a press conference, zoning by its very nature is contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15574)|
| 4:19:39| And I think this council has done, with the help of people here and throughout the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15579)|
| 4:19:44| has done a pretty amazing job in working through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15584)|
| 4:19:49| People will not always agree because that's how it is in the world we live in and the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15589)|
| 4:19:55| And in your own neighborhoods, it's the same way, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15595)|
| 4:19:58| So at this time, it would be appropriate, if council has no other motions or no other amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15598)|
| 4:20:09| what is the wish of council at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15609)|
| 4:20:13| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15613)|
| 4:20:14| I would like to make a motion that we adopt this recode as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15614)|
| 4:20:20| And this is on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15620)|
| 4:20:22| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15622)|
| 4:20:23| We require two readings in order to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15623)|
| 4:20:25| It also does not go into effect without the zoning map being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15625)|
| 4:20:31| So what is the motion that would be appropriate in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15631)|
| 4:20:35| Christina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15635)|
| 4:20:36| I think we need to include in that motion, number one, that we are postponing a discussion of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15636)|
| 4:20:43| and separating that from this process and postponing that to a time certain, if that's what we're comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15643)|
| 4:20:49| No, we're actually going to then move into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15649)|
| 4:20:51| I was hoping we would discuss the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15651)|
| 4:20:53| The whole point is we're just going to approve the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15653)|
| 4:20:56| Just the verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15656)|
| 4:20:57| Then in that case, the appropriate motion would be to separate the text of the code from the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15657)|
| 4:21:04| and vote to approve on first reading the text of the recode as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15664)|
| 4:21:10| That's what I thought I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15670)|
| 4:21:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15671)|
| 4:21:12| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15672)|
| 4:21:13| That was his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15673)|
| 4:21:14| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15674)|
| 4:21:15| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15675)|
| 4:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15676)|
| 4:21:17| Is there any further discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15677)|
| 4:21:18| So what do we do with the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15678)|
| 4:21:19| What do we do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15679)|
| 4:21:20| So then after this is over, then what I would like is for us to then, if council is willing, I hope you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15680)|
| 4:21:26| we already have, we know we have recommendations from Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15686)|
| 4:21:31| We have recommendations from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15691)|
| 4:21:32| They're in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15692)|
| 4:21:33| I would like for now, we'll take a short break and then move into looking at those and see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15693)|
| 4:21:40| I would propose we pick one of the dates we have in August and come back and look at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15700)|
| 4:21:44| instead of starting on that at 11 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15704)|
| 4:21:47| That is up to the will of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15707)|
| 4:21:49| If you want, we also have, what's today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15709)|
| 4:21:52| We're moving, we would actually take that up on July 30th then at our council meeting, next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15712)|
| 4:21:57| But we have two dates set aside in August for, you know, Monday, was it the 5th and then Monday the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15717)|
| 4:22:04| If we pass this tonight, then we'd have a second reading on the 30th, and we could also take up the map at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15724)|
| 4:22:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15730)|
| 4:22:11| We could, or we could postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15731)|
| 4:22:14| On first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15734)|
| 4:22:15| We could postpone it until we have enough time to talk about the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15735)|
| 4:22:18| I don't know how long we think the map's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15738)|
| 4:22:19| Well, that's why I would like to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15739)|
| 4:22:21| We don't know how long it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15741)|
| 4:22:23| When we get passed, if you start in August, we only have two dates set aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15743)|
| 4:22:27| and we already know there's some folks then who will be going out of town and won't be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15747)|
| 4:22:31| Lauren's got 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15751)|
| 4:22:33| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15753)|
| 4:22:34| Lauren's got 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15754)|
| 4:22:35| No, Lauren has 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15755)|
| 4:22:36| I don't blame it all on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15756)|
| 4:22:42| My point is we will, let us vote on the text, and then we'll get the consensus if you want to then adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15762)|
| 4:22:50| The next time, what we have said is that this then would be, we would then have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15770)|
| 4:22:56| We'll see what counsel votes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15776)|
| 4:22:57| I would encourage you to postpone it to the 30th, which is what we've already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15777)|
| 4:23:02| We would handle this on the 16th, the 30th, and then on the two dates in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15782)|
| 4:23:07| The second reading, as Vice Mayor Saunders said, will be on July 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15787)|
| 4:23:14| At that time, we can also begin discussion and see how far you get on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15794)|
| 4:23:21| That's what I would encourage counsel to do, to keep this moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15801)|
| 4:23:27| Right now, we have a motion, and did we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15807)|
| 4:23:32| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15812)|
| 4:23:33| You have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15813)|
| 4:23:34| On the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15814)|
| 4:23:36| Separated from the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15816)|
| 4:23:37| On first reading, as amended, knowing that the map still has to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15817)|
| 4:23:42| Counselwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15822)|
| 4:23:44| Oh, how did I get to be next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15824)|
| 4:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15826)|
| 4:23:47| I think he pushed his button first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15827)|
| 4:23:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15828)|
| 4:23:52| If, I would agree with Councilman Wallace about not starting the map tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15832)|
| 4:24:01| I would be inclined, because there's some specific things that I need to look at the detail of the Adair Gardens area before I can feel comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15841)|
| 4:24:09| and some other things that were more generalized in my list, and clarify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15849)|
| 4:24:14| So, I would like to consider, so whenever we wait 30-ish days between readings, like we've read through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15854)|
| 4:24:26| and then, obviously, I, tonight, was a primary example of not being able to remember what we discussed the previous time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15866)|
| 4:24:33| But on the other hand, I'm fine with voting on first reading tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15873)|
| 4:24:38| and I'm questioning whether second reading happens at the same time the map discussion happens on the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15878)|
| 4:24:43| or the prospect of second reading being a four-week span to give more time for reading of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15883)|
| 4:24:52| Suggestion, I wonder where my colleagues would stand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15892)|
| 4:24:56| And is that something that you could decide on July 30th, whether or not to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15896)|
| 4:25:03| rather than postponing it now, because if you've had sufficient, you may be ready on July 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15903)|
| 4:25:09| So, rather than make a motion to vote on second reading in four weeks, you leave it alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15909)|
| 4:25:13| and then we could make a motion to postpone it based on additional amendments or feedback on amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15913)|
| 4:25:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15919)|
| 4:25:22| When will we get a copy of what changes we made tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15922)|
| 4:25:26| We'll get, well, this is a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15926)|
| 4:25:31| How soon can you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15931)|
| 4:25:32| Initiated revisions, I mean, will we get an update of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15932)|
| 4:25:37| I will make a commitment to get that to you this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15937)|
| 4:25:40| And our staff will work with Christina and those staff to make sure we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15940)|
| 4:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15945)|
| 4:25:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15946)|
| 4:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15947)|

| 4:25:49| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15949)|
| 4:25:50| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15950)|
| 4:25:51| I mean, George just brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15951)|
| 4:25:54| I mean, when are we going to get those amendments, confirmations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15954)|
| 4:25:57| You know, there's a lot of people that have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15957)|
| 4:26:00| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15960)|
| 4:26:02| The amendments will be, we'll have them this week, and they will be posted on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15962)|
| 4:26:07| And again, I know it's just first reading, and you don't want to hear this, Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15967)|
| 4:26:10| but I still feel like there's a lot of people in the public that want more time to digest this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15970)|
| 4:26:15| what happened tonight at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15975)|
| 4:26:18| And, you know, we could, I mean, what's the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15978)|
| 4:26:21| We could wait two weeks until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15981)|
| 4:26:23| We could wait four weeks for a first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15983)|
| 4:26:26| I know that's not real attractive to most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15986)|
| 4:26:28| We all want to be done with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15988)|
| 4:26:30| But, you know, I think the public merit a little more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15990)|
| 4:26:33| even if it's just a minimum of two weeks, to talk about what happened tonight and what transpired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15993)|
| 4:26:37| because they'll read it three days from now, no offense, Tyler, in the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=15997)|
| 4:26:41| And, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16001)|
| 4:26:43| He doesn't control that, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16003)|
| 4:26:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16005)|
| 4:26:46| It's nothing personal, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16006)|
| 4:26:48| Although the misquote today was not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16008)|
| 4:26:51| So, anyway, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16011)|
| 4:26:53| I just, I would be willing to propose a two-week postponement for a first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16013)|
| 4:26:58| And if there's any support for that, then I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16018)|
| 4:27:04| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16024)|
| 4:27:05| Just let council discuss this, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16025)|
| 4:27:07| I mean, this is about the council's decision on when they want to vote or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16027)|
| 4:27:11| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16031)|
| 4:27:12| I would prefer that, unless council calls on someone, we've been very flexible with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16032)|
| 4:27:18| This is what I've signed up to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16038)|
| 4:27:21| So, when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16041)|
| 4:27:22| Actually, you have not spoken yet, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16042)|
| 4:27:25| Why don't you go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16045)|
| 4:27:26| And I'll be willing to wait until council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16046)|
| 4:27:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16047)|
| 4:27:28| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16048)|
| 4:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16049)|
| 4:27:30| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, resident of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16050)|
| 4:27:36| On July 11th of 2019, Community Forum submitted its comprehensive response to Draft 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16056)|
| 4:27:42| as amended through the May 30th special meeting of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16062)|
| 4:27:46| We previously submitted our original response to Draft 5 on May 27th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16066)|
| 4:27:53| On July 11th, we urged City Council to postpone first reading approval of recode on July 16th, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16073)|
| 4:28:01| We renew that request tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16081)|
| 4:28:04| Many amendments on many topics have been discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16084)|
| 4:28:08| There has been much debate among City Council members and by members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16088)|
| 4:28:13| There has been no detailed discussion on the recode map before tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16093)|
| 4:28:18| Now, it looks like we may not be discussing it tonight, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16098)|
| 4:28:22| It is unknown when there will be a vote on the recode map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16102)|
| 4:28:26| Therefore, members of City Council and the public deserve a reasonable amount of time to review recode in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16106)|
| 4:28:35| after amendments have been approved before it is considered on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16115)|
| 4:28:41| I and many others have attended all of the City Council workshops, City Council special meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16121)|
| 4:28:47| many stakeholder committee meetings, and many other meetings on recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16127)|
| 4:28:51| Community Forum has submitted responses to all drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16131)|
| 4:28:55| We have worked hard to improve the proposed zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16135)|
| 4:28:59| We have made detailed recommendations, many of which have been agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16139)|
| 4:29:03| We have asked many questions, which have generated debate and revisions of recode language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16143)|
| 4:29:09| I'm going to add in here that we still have some other issues that have not been brought up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16149)|
| 4:29:15| And if you vote on this now, then we will probably try to come back at second reading to bring up some more amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16155)|
| 4:29:22| because we had more that have not been addressed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16162)|
| 4:29:25| As far as deciding now whether to vote on first reading tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16165)|
| 4:29:30| it is really irrelevant at this point in time what has taken place in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16170)|
| 4:29:35| how many meetings and workshops there have been, and what was done at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16175)|
| 4:29:40| The only relevant thing right now, tonight, is what is before City Council right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16180)|
| 4:29:46| It is crucial that City Council take whatever time is necessary to fully understand exactly what they are being asked to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16186)|
| 4:29:55| before they should be asked to make their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16195)|
| 4:29:57| City Council must clearly understand why significant changes are being made from the existing ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16197)|
| 4:30:04| and what impact those changes will have on individual properties and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16204)|
| 4:30:09| Likewise, it is crucial that the public understands what is in the current document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16209)|
| 4:30:15| so that they can offer whatever additional input they may have before a vote is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16215)|
| 4:30:22| We must do everything possible to get this right before it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16222)|
| 4:30:29| Thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16229)|
| 4:30:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16232)|
| 4:30:39| Okay, so we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16239)|
| 4:30:43| I didn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16243)|
| 4:30:44| And there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16244)|
| 4:30:45| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16245)|
| 4:30:46| No, there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16246)|
| 4:30:47| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16247)|
| 4:30:48| Well, no, there was a motion to postpone and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16248)|
| 4:30:50| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16250)|
| 4:30:51| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16251)|
| 4:30:52| Priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16252)|
| 4:30:53| To wait until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16253)|
| 4:30:54| The next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16254)|
| 4:30:55| Two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16255)|
| 4:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16256)|
| 4:30:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16257)|
| 4:30:58| Motion to postpone is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16258)|
| 4:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16261)|
| 4:31:02| That's not what I was seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16262)|
| 4:31:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16263)|
| 4:31:04| Okay, so there's a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16264)|
| 4:31:05| Did someone second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16265)|
| 4:31:06| I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16266)|
| 4:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16267)|
| 4:31:08| Okay, so there's a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16268)|
| 4:31:09| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16269)|
| 4:31:10| Are you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16270)|
| 4:31:11| And this would be to postpone to when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16271)|
| 4:31:12| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16272)|
| 4:31:13| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16273)|
| 4:31:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16274)|
| 4:31:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16275)|

| 4:38:45| just found a way to opt out of what they didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16725)|
| 4:38:51| The map itself has lost a lot of multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16731)|
| 4:38:59| It feels like the same old thing, where people who do well want to preserve what they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16739)|
| 4:39:05| and we have given in to that, and we're not making any spaces for people who aren't here, who don't have much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16745)|
| 4:39:13| We're not providing more housing spaces for apartments, duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16753)|
| 4:39:22| Sorry, I'm really upset after that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16762)|
| 4:39:27| Just West Hills choosing to opt out really upsets me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16767)|
| 4:39:31| It makes me feel like one well-to-do neighborhood has just decided to slice themselves out of what they don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16771)|
| 4:39:39| and that's not fair to the rest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16779)|
| 4:39:42| So I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16782)|
| 4:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16785)|
| 4:39:49| We have a motion to approve the text of the document on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16789)|
| 4:39:58| and to postpone review of the zoning map or vote on the zoning map until July 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16798)|

| 4:40:20| So that passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16820)|
| 4:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16822)|
| 4:40:23| So thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16823)|
| 4:40:27| Thank you, everyone who has labored through all of this with us and with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16827)|
| 4:40:34| We now have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16834)|
| 4:40:36| So we have four individuals who are here and have waited all this time, so we really appreciate them doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16836)|
| 4:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16845)|

| 4:40:54| So if you would please come forward and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16854)|
| 4:40:58| As you know, we'll have the timer up there, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16858)|
| 4:41:03| Kristen Kempfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16863)|
| 4:41:06| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16866)|
| 4:41:07| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16867)|
| 4:41:08| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16868)|
| 4:41:09| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16869)|
| 4:41:10| So I've been sitting here all night, and I'm just going to say what I need to say and go home so I can get up in the morning and go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16870)|
| 4:41:17| So I'm here today to just inform each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16877)|
| 4:41:22| I live at 429 East Morelia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16882)|
| 4:41:26| I was a victim of the Fort Loudon waste and recycling fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16886)|
| 4:41:34| I don't even know what to say, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16894)|
| 4:41:37| I don't even want to read from my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16897)|
| 4:41:40| I am disappointed in most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16900)|
| 4:41:46| I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16906)|
| 4:41:48| My husband has been there 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16908)|
| 4:41:52| That is his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16912)|
| 4:41:55| And we have not got any answers, nothing clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16915)|
| 4:41:59| We don't understand why they are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16919)|
| 4:42:03| They are continuing to bring in new material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16923)|
| 4:42:06| No one's stopping them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16926)|
| 4:42:08| They're just, it's like a slap in the face to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16928)|
| 4:42:13| How fair is that to me or my community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16933)|
| 4:42:19| So I sit here and I listen to each of y'all tonight, and y'all can talk to each other, but you can't talk and have a conversation with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16939)|
| 4:42:30| All we want are answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16950)|
| 4:42:32| And all I've got is, oh, he said this, she said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16952)|
| 4:42:38| They're lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16958)|
| 4:42:40| I can tell you, they're just dictating each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16960)|
| 4:42:45| So I'm here to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16965)|
| 4:42:48| I'm not, I really am not even asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16968)|
| 4:42:51| I want to know what your plans are as to what we can do as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16971)|
| 4:43:00| What can we do to help our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16980)|
| 4:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16984)|
| 4:43:06| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16986)|
| 4:43:08| Mayor, can we get an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16988)|
| 4:43:09| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16989)|
| 4:43:10| Let's hear from the individuals, perhaps, and then we can, Mr. Brace and Chief Sharp can give an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16990)|
| 4:43:18| Amanda Burns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16998)|
| 4:43:19| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=16999)|
| 4:43:20| Amanda Burns, 2310 Harvey Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17000)|
| 4:43:24| As you're well aware, there was an inevitable fire that broke out at the Fort Lauderdale Recycling Center in OLP, May 1st, for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17004)|
| 4:43:33| Black smoke filled both the air and many of our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17013)|
| 4:43:38| On May 13th, we were told that the facility was a total loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17018)|
| 4:43:43| They had been issued a stop work order, and cleanup would begin immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17023)|
| 4:43:50| To our dismay, many neighbors, including myself, have seen truckloads of paper and cardboard being brought in continuously since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17030)|
| 4:43:59| The business owners apparently have given some excuses for why this new material is coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17039)|
| 4:44:05| one being that in the middle of this raging fire, they were able to move out all these truckloads of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17045)|
| 4:44:11| I'm still uncertain how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17051)|
| 4:44:17| So I think to myself, let's just see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17057)|
| 4:44:19| Let's see what city council is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17059)|
| 4:44:21| Let's see if we really get some help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17061)|
| 4:44:24| Hopefully, we'll start seeing some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17064)|
| 4:44:28| Today is July 16th, and I personally saw a truckload of paper go in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17068)|
| 4:44:35| 11 a.m. this morning, I've already sent a photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17075)|
| 4:44:39| 8.30 this morning, someone else in the neighborhood has them on video bringing in another truckload of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17079)|
| 4:44:47| They were a fire hazard then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17087)|
| 4:44:49| I don't see how they have rectified the fire hazard now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17089)|
| 4:45:02| Most of you may not know this, but I am actually a licensed mental health professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17102)|
| 4:45:07| and I have lots of conversations about relationships with my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17107)|
| 4:45:14| And I look up here at the elected officials, and as a community, we're supposed to have a relationship with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17114)|
| 4:45:23| When people show you who they are, believe them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17123)|
| 4:45:28| That's my Angelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17128)|
| 4:45:30| I'd have that discussion with a lot of my patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17130)|
| 4:45:35| Who have you shown us that you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17135)|
| 4:45:38| Please prove me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17138)|
| 4:45:40| Please prove me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17140)|
| 4:45:42| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17142)|
| 4:45:43| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| Heath Gaines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17145)|
| 4:45:47| Is Mr. Gaines here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17147)|
| 4:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17150)|
| 4:45:51| Mr. Breitenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| West Breitenbach, 726 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17154)|
| 4:46:00| I think we can all agree that we're here in the best interest of the city, that we love and we live in, we work in and we play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17160)|
| 4:46:11| I know a lot of us want to move forward, take the city forward in a good direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17171)|
| 4:46:16| I think in order to do that, we need to address the situation and circumstances that are going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17176)|
| 4:46:24| I think moving the city forward with the way things are being handled currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17184)|
| 4:46:30| we aren't going to have a very strong foundation of a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17190)|
| 4:46:34| I have a lot of things that I wanted to bring up about the Fort Lowndon recycling facility that is still going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17194)|
| 4:46:40| I was given some paperwork by Heath, and I'll speak on his behalf and a couple of other residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17200)|
| 4:46:47| In front of me right now are two citations from code enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17207)|
| 4:46:56| I'm in just disbelief reading these citations, but they're requesting the residents that are on Morelia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17216)|
| 4:47:02| two of them here, two citations from codes, to clean up the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17222)|
| 4:47:10| I know, it's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17230)|
| 4:47:11| North Street, I'm trying to explain this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17231)|
| 4:47:18| North Street runs east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17238)|
| 4:47:21| You have the residents of Morelia that live south of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17241)|
| 4:47:24| You have North Street, and you have the Fort Lowndon recycling facility on the north side of North Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17244)|
| 4:47:30| Codes enforcement is asking these residents, actually citing them, telling them they're responsible for cleaning up the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17250)|
| 4:47:40| that is in the city right-of-way on the opposite side of their residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17260)|
| 4:47:44| That is on the city right-of-way on the property of the Fort Lowndon recycling facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17264)|
| 4:47:51| It is not anywhere near 317 Morelia or 323 Morelia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17271)|
| 4:47:59| Two citations that our residents of that neighborhood have received for cleaning up an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17279)|
| 4:48:05| which I would be best described as culturally, that facility has developed a culture of dumping on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17285)|
| 4:48:17| I don't have a performance scheduled for this evening to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17297)|
| 4:48:23| I encourage you to go and look and set your own eyes on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17303)|
| 4:48:28| But I cannot believe that the city would cite the residents living on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17308)|
| 4:48:36| for something that we all know they did not do and did not partake in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17316)|
| 4:48:39| And we all know that people go up and down that road and dump things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17319)|
| 4:48:41| because Fort Lowndon recycling has put up the image that that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17321)|
| 4:48:45| It's a dump over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17325)|
| 4:48:46| So that's why people go do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17326)|
| 4:48:48| However, I do know and I'm pretty confident that you'll handle this, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17328)|
| 4:48:54| that you'll let the codes department know that that was a miscommunication on their behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17334)|
| 4:48:58| and that they're misguided in these citations to those residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17338)|
| 4:49:02| These should be in the hands of the Fort Lowndon recycling facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17342)|
| 4:49:07| That's their right-of-way on their property right next to their fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17347)|
| 4:49:12| There's a lot of things the Fort Lowndon recycling facility should be doing that they aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17352)|
| 4:49:18| And when I see these citations issued to the residents that have been fighting this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17358)|
| 4:49:25| the Fort Lowndon recycling facility, and trying to work with you guys to get something done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17365)|
| 4:49:29| I see all the blatant code violations that have been sitting there since the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17369)|
| 4:49:37| Three months they've been sitting there since the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17377)|
| 4:49:41| Now, I want to know where is their letter telling them that they have 14 days to clean up their mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17381)|
| 4:49:46| I want to know where their letter is saying that they're responsible for the stuff dumped out of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17386)|
| 4:49:52| We asked you guys some very simple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17392)|
| 4:49:58| When are you going to hold them accountable and when are they going to have to have this mess cleaned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17398)|
| 4:50:03| When? That's all we want to know. Give us a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17403)|
| 4:50:05| You've told the residents they have 14 days to clean up a mess they didn't create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17405)|
| 4:50:09| When are you going to tell Fort Lowndon, when are you going to give them a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17409)|
| 4:50:12| When are you going to tell us that this is going to get cleaned up by a certain date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17412)|
| 4:50:16| That's all we want. It should be implemented. It should be a simple, simple plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17416)|
| 4:50:21| If you do not have a plan in place to deal with an industrial hazard, an accident such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17421)|
| 4:50:29| please do not let your term as mayor end without having a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17429)|
| 4:50:36| Because it's not a question of if this will happen again. It's going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17436)|
| 4:50:40| Does it happen at this facility? It happens in another neighborhood somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17440)|
| 4:50:44| You need to communicate with the residents when they come to you time and time and time again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17444)|
| 4:50:51| and you feed them the same misinformation, lack of information, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17451)|
| 4:50:57| When we have news organizations that can't find a business permit and then all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17457)|
| 4:51:02| we're told that that business has a permit, why don't you give us a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17462)|
| 4:51:06| I mean, that's what I would do if my neighbors were asking me where my business permit was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17466)|
| 4:51:11| I'd say, here it is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17471)|
| 4:51:13| So, we have not received really any answers to any of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17473)|
| 4:51:18| All we've received is hearsay and we'll get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17478)|
| 4:51:23| So, I appreciate the fact that we are able to get up here and express this information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17483)|
| 4:51:31| I understand that you cannot have eyes on everything at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17491)|
| 4:51:35| We've tried to be your eyes. We've come here. We're telling you what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17495)|
| 4:51:39| We still feel like nobody's listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17499)|
| 4:51:42| Well, we're not going anywhere. I bought a building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17502)|
| 4:51:46| I'm living there. I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17506)|
| 4:51:48| None of these people are going anywhere and we'll be here until something's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17508)|
| 4:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17512)|
| 4:51:56| Chief Sharp and David Brace, do you want to give an update, please, for counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17516)|
| 4:52:01| Yeah, and I'll kick this over to Chief Sharp pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17521)|
| 4:52:03| I know I received an inspection update from Allison Dyer in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17523)|
| 4:52:11| I know that Sonny Parton was there today and was there, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17531)|
| 4:52:16| I sent that out to counsel yesterday or the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17536)|
| 4:52:19| So, I think there is obviously the ongoing inspection and enforcement with Fort Loudon Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17539)|
| 4:52:27| excuse me, Fort Loudon Waste and Recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17547)|
| 4:52:30| So, there is the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17550)|
| 4:52:32| And our law department and our codes department and our fire department folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17552)|
| 4:52:37| I sent a fairly extensive email out to city council that hopefully was forwarded along to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17557)|
| 4:52:43| We're doing everything we can within the guise of the law to enforce the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17563)|
| 4:52:48| There was an investigation by the insurance company that slowed that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17568)|
| 4:52:51| They do have legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17571)|
| 4:52:53| And so, we've done that to the best of our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17573)|
| 4:52:58| Where's the copy of their citations for the violations that they're in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17578)|
| 4:53:02| They're in clear violation of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17582)|
| 4:53:04| Sir, Mr. Freitenbach, please hold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17584)|
| 4:53:06| You can talk to him afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17586)|
| 4:53:08| So, let him report to counsel and then if you would like to ask questions, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17588)|
| 4:53:12| And I think there's the issue with the fire and the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17592)|
| 4:53:16| And then there's the issue with an industrial floor property directly adjacent to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17596)|
| 4:53:21| which I, as a former member of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood, I live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17601)|
| 4:53:25| I understand that that is challenging in multiple locations in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17605)|
| 4:53:29| So, let's talk about the immediate issue, which is the fire, the cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17609)|
| 4:53:34| and holding Fort Loudon Waste and Recycling accountable to the best of our ability as per the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17614)|
| 4:53:39| and our guidance from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17619)|
| 4:53:41| So, we're doing everything we can to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17621)|
| 4:53:43| At the same time, for example, today, starting to work with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17623)|
| 4:53:48| to look at how you could access Fort Loudon Lake and recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17628)|
| 4:53:52| excuse me, Fort Loudon Waste and Recycling, I keep saying lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17632)|
| 4:53:56| in a way that is less detrimental to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17636)|
| 4:53:59| Every truck drives right through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17639)|
| 4:54:01| It's been that way for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17641)|
| 4:54:03| So, there's the big picture and there's the near term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17643)|
| 4:54:06| And I want to assure counsel we're doing everything we can with guidance from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17646)|
| 4:54:11| And I will get you a copy of all of the NOVs and the citations that have been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17651)|
| 4:54:16| I did get an email request for a copy of the business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17656)|
| 4:54:21| I have that on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17661)|
| 4:54:22| And I'm meeting tomorrow with the finance department and the business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17662)|
| 4:54:26| to get you that paperwork as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17666)|
| 4:54:29| And so, I think I've attempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17669)|
| 4:54:32| I came to the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17672)|
| 4:54:33| I think fire department was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17673)|
| 4:54:35| We've offered to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17675)|
| 4:54:36| I think we don't have all the answers yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17676)|
| 4:54:38| because we're still waiting on Fort Loudon Recycling to actually finalize their cleanup plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17678)|
| 4:54:47| But they were on site today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17687)|
| 4:54:48| I'll kick it over to Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17688)|
| 4:54:50| We've got a copy of that report, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17690)|
| 4:54:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17692)|
| 4:54:53| Yes, I have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17693)|
| 4:54:55| Yeah, Sonny Parton is in our fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17695)|
| 4:55:02| He's been going over there virtually every day since the fire, every day through the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17702)|
| 4:55:08| They have been making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17708)|
| 4:55:10| Our primary concern is to prevent another fire there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17710)|
| 4:55:14| So, the main thing we've wanted is to get the combustibles off site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17714)|
| 4:55:18| That has been slower than what we had hoped on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17718)|
| 4:55:22| It's been much slower than what we hoped would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17722)|
| 4:55:26| As of yesterday, there were actually three large piles of cardboard and other waste that were on the west end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17726)|
| 4:55:37| About roughly three weeks ago, one of the piles was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17737)|
| 4:55:40| Two weeks ago, the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17740)|
| 4:55:42| As of yesterday, that third pile was gone, which has been our primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17742)|
| 4:55:47| That doesn't mean that all the combustibles are off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17747)|
| 4:55:50| But they have made significant progress in the last week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17750)|
| 4:55:55| Sonny was over there again today to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17755)|
| 4:56:02| I was sent a picture earlier today, and I've talked with one of the individuals, of a truck that looked like it was entering the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17762)|
| 4:56:10| We'll have Sonny follow up on that tomorrow, a truck that may have had material on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17770)|
| 4:56:15| That's an important note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17775)|
| 4:56:17| Every video, every link, every complaint has been sent along to CODES and to FIRE for enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17777)|
| 4:56:23| Chief Thomas received an email today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17783)|
| 4:56:25| There have been concerns about vehicles, trucks, rollbacks without tags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17785)|
| 4:56:30| Chief Thomas has forwarded that to their BEAT officers for added enforcement, leaving and coming into the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17790)|
| 4:56:37| All of the information you provided, we have passed along to FIRE and to Neighborhood CODES, to Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17797)|

| 4:56:51| What about those two citations on Morelia that he mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17811)|
| 4:56:54| Right. Peter, do you know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17814)|
| 4:56:57| That's inconsistent with how they typically act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17817)|
| 4:57:01| Usually, you're responsible for your property leading out to the street on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17821)|
| 4:57:08| I'm going to look into that tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17828)|
| 4:57:10| We get copies of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17830)|
| 4:57:11| If you've got those, we'll take a quick picture and we'll look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17831)|
| 4:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17834)|
| 4:57:15| I did ask our public service crews, Chad and Wes, to go through and look at the access into the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17835)|
| 4:57:21| to see if there was any patching, street maintenance, sweeping that needed to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17841)|
| 4:57:25| as well as just any general cleanup of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17845)|
| 4:57:30| But let's look at those, and if that happened, we'll make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17850)|
| 4:57:35| Hey, David, I've got one last quick note regarding the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17855)|
| 4:57:40| Is there a timeline for the cleanup, or is it open-ended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17860)|
| 4:57:43| Like, do they have two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17863)|
| 4:57:45| I mean, is there a deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17865)|
| 4:57:48| So when people have devastating fires, regardless of—so people have lumped in Tosha violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17868)|
| 4:57:56| failure to pay taxes, and the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17876)|
| 4:58:01| And so there's a process that Doug Gordon and the law department follows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17881)|
| 4:58:05| when people are behind on their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17885)|
| 4:58:07| and it is separate than the process when we've had a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17887)|
| 4:58:10| So they had a devastating fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17890)|
| 4:58:12| They had an insurance company come in and initiate an investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17892)|
| 4:58:16| and they are working with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17896)|
| 4:58:18| They have an attorney, Mary Ann Stackhouse, that is working with them to develop a timeline on the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17898)|
| 4:58:26| So we have not yet given them an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17906)|
| 4:58:31| As you guys are aware of this, we would go before the public officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17911)|
| 4:58:34| and request an order for that type of cleanup to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17914)|
| 4:58:39| That has not happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17919)|
| 4:58:40| They had a fire in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17920)|
| 4:58:46| May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17926)|
| 4:58:47| And so that fire happened, and their attorney came to our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17927)|
| 4:58:51| to discuss their activities and their plan to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17931)|
| 4:58:55| So there is not an order with a drop-dead date yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17935)|
| 4:58:59| We need to check with Allison and Mr. Swanson to see if they have worked out a drop-dead date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17939)|
| 4:59:06| But my understanding is they are actively working on cleaning up the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17946)|
| 4:59:09| Now that the investigation is complete, they can actively do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17949)|
| 4:59:13| and it has been slower than we would like, but they have made progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17953)|
| 4:59:17| We have passed all of the concerns about bringing waste onto the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17957)|
| 4:59:21| new material onto the site, over to the fire department and codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17961)|
| 4:59:24| and attempted to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17964)|
| 4:59:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17968)|
| 4:59:30| All right, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17970)|
| 4:59:31| Is there any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=17971)|
