| 0:03:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Those among the more observant of you have noticed that three of our council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Is there a quorum for this group and for those watching the rules regarding passing things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| and how it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Whenever you're passing an ordinance or a resolution, it always takes five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| It's the majority of the number of persons elected, as opposed to the majority of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| who are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| If it's an emergency measure, it will still take six votes to adopt any emergency measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| So be reminded of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=228)|

| 0:08:31| And thank you for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| And for serving for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Okay, second item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| I'd like to ask Master Firefighter Jeff Nichols to come down to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| And Chief Sharp will join him down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| Jeff, as you all know, a lot of you all remember this story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| but it's worth noting, and specifically us recognizing today, three weeks ago on Sunday, on July 18th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| Jeff was on his way to work, 6.20 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| Actually, he isn't on duty yet, but on his way to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| And he spotted some smoke coming out of a house in the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| He works at the downtown station, but was getting off the interstate right there at Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| I think I have this story right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| And he saw the smoke and did the right thing and went to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| Couldn't find the source at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| but then noticed an orange glow coming from between two of the Victorian houses there on 11th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| and both houses were on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Ran to the first house, determined it was empty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| and then rushed to the second house where several young people were living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| He yelled at them to leave and grabbed at least one sleeping person, maybe more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| and physically pulled him up and helped him from the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| His actions literally saved the lives, I think, definitely from a serious injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| and I think possibly from death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| And we are very grateful for his actions, proactive actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Like I said, he wasn't on duty at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| He just saw it, noticed it, and reacted to his training and ran to the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| He, less kind of of any threat to his own safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| entered into two different burning houses to help other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| And it's what firefighters are supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| It's what they're trained to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| And we have a lot of other firefighters who would have done the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| This time it was Jeff's turn, and he reacted in a way that made us all proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| So, Jeff, on behalf of the city of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| we'd like to present you a certificate of merit to recognize the incredible job you did that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| And I know the folks who, like I said, who you saved from serious injury or worse are as grateful as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| So on behalf of the city of Knox, we'll thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| Job very well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=638)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you, Chief, and thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| I also want to recognize this tonight, the Youth Action Council who is with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| and thank you all very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| And I think you're, I'm not certain if one of you all wants to come and maybe say a quick word or if the leader does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| I'm not sure if there's a designated spokesperson or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Sarah, anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| If you just come down and maybe give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| and give us just a quick 15 seconds on what the Youth Action Council does, and then that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=689)|

| 0:11:39| We try to give, I guess, a teen's perspective to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| We try to answer a couple of questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| And we're just, we're, I guess, we're made up of different students from many different high schools here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| and we just try to help out, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=718)|

| 0:12:04| actually all of Knox County as well as the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=724)|

| 0:12:18| and as well as being the chair of county commission, appreciate his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I think Sarah Harder is here, is the new advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=743)|

| 0:12:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| I just wanted to add a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| As president of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, we are the sponsoring agency of the Youth Action Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| and we are so proud of their work in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| and proud to have the opportunity to give this opportunity for leadership to our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=765)|

| 0:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Mr. Dellivolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Just briefly, I just want to thank the folks from Town Hall East and East Knoxville that got together this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| We were working on the new Bookworm Park being built next door to the Burlington Branch Library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| and folks were out there planting plants and working in the hot sun and getting it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| and the park is coming along, and I just wanted to thank them for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| They volunteered their time and their effort in plants and materials and tools, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| And thanks for your leadership on that over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| On August the 23rd, I'm hosting the Cumberland Estates Community for get to know what your city is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| but probably the most important thing is that representatives from the Department of Transportation will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| to discuss the widening of Western Avenue, the long-awaited widening of Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| and they will have visuals and some time to share how that project is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| And I know everyone who drives on Western Avenue at any time is excited about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| and we're ready for the orange barrels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| So August the 23rd at 7 p.m. at the Cumberland Estates Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| I want to talk about the 800-pound gorilla that's always in this room and nobody ever seems to allude to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| but I had the opportunity last Thursday to be at Mayor Haslam's event in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| and just wanted to tell you how proud I am of the great showing that you had in the primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| and you'll, of course, go on to the runoff now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Bill and I were talking before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| It's been 150 years, I think, since Knoxville's had a governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| So, I mean, you're not there yet, but you're certainly in that ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| So just congratulations, and I know it's a lot of hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| There's people from all over the state, all walks of life, and it was really a very nice event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=895)|

| 0:15:09| and hopefully we'll have enough people here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Are we going to postpone hens again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=913)|

| 0:15:32| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| No more romantic place than to spend it at city council, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Patrick thinks he got out of a dinner somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=941)|

| 0:15:53| It's from 7.30 in the morning to 1.30 in the afternoon, and there's a breakfast and a lunch and golf instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| and it's a really good opportunity for inner city kids to go get the chance to learn golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| and appreciate one of our parks, Knox Municipal Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| And I was out there yesterday, and we have about 38 kids from all walks of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| and it's just a really good thing to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| So if you have someone that would like to take advantage of an opportunity, it's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| The Billy Casper Group, who manages our two golf courses, are doing a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| And so if you have kids that want to go out ages 7 to 18, and if you want to just go out and observe, I ask you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=987)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=999)|

| 0:18:21| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| I'd like to ask, could you tell us a little bit more about the program in terms of what kinds of fields they're being trained for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| What's the objective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| The objective is to take seniors who qualify based on income, to retrain them, to help them become more employable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1111)|
| 0:18:40| and then to help them with job placement in any walks of life here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| Now, as far as where the training takes place, we place them in various non-profits that are qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| and they do their training at non-profit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| We help them with some continuing education like computer training, other areas that they might need help with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| and then we help them go look for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| That's one of the requirements to be a senior aide is you have to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| and actively seek employment while you work your 20-hour a week job through the senior aid program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| So you help them kind of get up-to-date skills so they can get the jobs that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1158)|

| 0:19:46| I'd like to thank him for helping us acquire this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| I think it will be a real asset to the expansion of Victor Ashe Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| and we will be deciding on some ways to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Community Garden is one of the things that's been tossed around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Land Bank is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1201)|

| 0:20:10| So this is an exciting thing for the 3rd District and Victor Ashe Park, the most used park in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| Very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1216)|

| 0:20:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I'd just like to dovetail off what Councilwoman Palmer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| I know when I served the previous eight years under Victor that there was nobody more dedicated to creation of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| and greenways, and it is a true passion of his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| And this, you know, you can be passionate about it, but when you write a check, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| this amount, what have you, shows that he still cares, obviously, for his city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| but for the creation and, you know, expansion of these parks and greenways, which are so important to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| So it's a really nice gesture on his part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1253)|

| 0:22:16| It's a great, great feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1336)|

| 0:23:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I just wanted to ask, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I understand this to be an extension of an existing contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| and we're doing it at this time because we think we're going to save more money over the life of the extended contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| I think that's right, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| I mean, basically we're locking in a price now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| So by exercising our options on these right now for the extension of the contract, we hope to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| The timing is right for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| The contract had some built-in increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| and the contractor came to us and asked if we would extend it at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1432)|

| 0:25:11| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I just want to understand, Mr. Mayor, we are setting up the opportunity to buy these at an appraised value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| but not necessarily exercising an option at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Larry, you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Councilmember Della Vopi, what we're doing here, this is somewhat of a reverse option, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| We've agreed to purchase these properties, one property at a time, at the appraised value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| if the fair decides that they want to sell that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| And it could be any of the three pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| We've got the first right of refusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Well, no, we're obligating ourselves to purchase the property if they ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| Just as you would have an option to buy a piece of property if you chose to exercise that option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| that seller has agreed to sell it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| In this case, the purchaser has agreed to purchase if they so choose to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| The reverse of an option is a put, and that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| A better set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| And, of course, the Chilhowee Park area is a great resource this city has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| and getting additional lands tied to it just expands the opportunities to make that a centerpiece for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| What it means is either the fair is going to own it or we're going to own it, and we think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1599)|

| 0:27:12| to Amend and Ratify the Minimum Number of Signatures Required for a Petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Accompanying a Proposed Ordinance for Initiative and Referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1636)|

| 0:27:29| for approval as provided in Article 11, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| requested by Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| As a way of introduction to this, I'd like to give a little bit of background in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and then I think certainly we may want to hear from speakers who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| As all of us found out earlier in the year, there was a conflict with the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| that was stated in our charter for petition for referendum and the threshold set by the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| What is written in our charter, if a citizen would look up online and try to find that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| is that 30% of the voters who voted in the most recent mayoral election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| 30% of that number is required on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| However, the State of Tennessee in 1997 passed a statute that trumped our city charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| saying that instead the threshold was 15% of all the registered voters in the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| And so my intent with this ordinance is simply clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| I think that every citizen should be able to look at our charter and know what the rules of the game are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| And right now it's very confusing because we see one thing in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| and unless you know there's this state statute that trumps our charter, you don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| The proposal of a percent of the registered voters in the city of Knoxville is because I think, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| the rules of the game are so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And whereas a percent of those who participate or vote in a mayoral election is a widely variable threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| that can vary quite a bit from year to year depending on voter participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| depending on how highly contested that election might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| a percent of registered voters is a more stable, consistent standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| Certainly voter registration can vary from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| And Mr. Swanson and I have already talked about one thing that will need to be added to this if we go this route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| is a date certain to certify the number of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| So, for example, on January 1 of a given year, you certify that's how many registered voters are within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| and then the percentage is taken thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| That way, again, the standard for folks who want to be a part of this and have a concern, which is certainly valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1783)|
| 0:29:52| it's a standard that's predictable and fair and fairly constant going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| All that being said, I think amendment of our charter, amendment of any government document of governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1798)|
| 0:30:08| is a serious issue, and since a third of our membership are not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| I think this council, after hearing from the public who are here, may want to consider a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| I think this is something that should not be done in haste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| and I certainly would wish for all of our members to be part of this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Yes, I wanted to address this and raise about three points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| And one is that I think that it's good to have perhaps a certain number, but I'm questioning 15 percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1828)|
| 0:30:37| There's roughly 100,000 voters in the city of Knoxville at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Fifteen percent is 15,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| I'm not sure of the others on this panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| but I am one person who has actually filed a petition with the election board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| and went out and chased signatures for the no new billboard ordinance that the city of Knoxville ultimately adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| And it is a very trying task for a citizen and a group of citizens to go out and get that number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| It really takes a lot of work, and it almost puts it beyond reasonable practical achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| I mean, you've got 60 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I think it's 60 days after that petition is certified, it's 60 or 90, to gather the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| And I'll tell you that we were out in front of Kroger stores all around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| We went to neighborhood groups and community group meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| It's a daunting task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| And I submit that if we're going to go to a number certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| we should either have just an arithmetic number like 5,000 signatures or 6,000 signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| or something that meets the test of, number one, discouraging frivolous things from getting on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| And I'm the last person in the world that wants to see us like California with a proposition on what cereal you have for breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| They're the other extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| The flip side, though, is that unless you are a moneyed entity trying to get something on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| I think, and you can pay organized people to go out and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I think it's very hard for citizens to bring something to the table that gets to the voters with a threshold that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| We don't see that many voters show up at the elections, and that's a concern we've always had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| So I would like to see us have either an absolute number, like 5,000 or 6,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| or something that you all debate about and tell us about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| or a percentage that's much lower, like 5 or 6 percent, if we're dealing with a deck that's got about 100,000 cards in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| And so that's one of my positions to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| The second, of course, I will endorse what Ms. Roddy said about a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| If we're going to use a percentage, I would propose under 709B that we put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| measured as of January 1 of the year in which the petition is certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| because I was told that actually the number of registered voters varies from day to day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| and January 1 is a day they have no difficulty calculating because they're not open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| and so they have the number that's basically accumulated for the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| But any date certain like that is a helpful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| The other point, though, I think that I want to make is that Section 708 of our charter deals with recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| and I don't know that we're ever going to run into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| but we also measure things in that provision by a 30 percent of voter kind of test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| It happens to be the number of voters who voted for a particular office that you're trying to recall the official for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| And it strikes me that if we're going to change our charter to have certainty for initiative and referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| we might as well do 708 at the same time and have a consistent standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| There's no sense in having two standards, whether it's a 30 percent rule, a 15 percent rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| or some other rule like 5 percent or 5,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| I think those two ought to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| It's not a major thing, but I think that we ought to have one test for how you get information on a ballot for an action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| that's citizen broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| So that's my proposal, that we look at a different number or a different way of computing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| I'd like to just follow up on some of the comments that have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| You know, I hate that three members of council aren't present tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| particularly Councilman Grieve, who's on the men from his surgery and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| and hopefully he'll be with us very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| But, you know, it's been the policy, I think, since I've been the seven months on council, that this is frustrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| and I don't see any reason whatsoever why we shouldn't go ahead and address this this evening on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| and pass it or vote it down, whatever's going to happen, but go ahead and move it along and get to talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| Because it will be, you know, potentially it could be on the ballot coming up in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| and then, Mr. Swanson, if I'm correct, it will be two more years before it would have to be held during a state election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| either primary or general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| If this is not adopted in two weeks from tonight, we will have passed the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| where it will be possible under the election commission rules and the state law to get it on the ballot for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| so it will be two years down the road before the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| So, I mean, with that intent, I mean, if this is a serious issue, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| it came to the forefront this year on a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So, you know, something that, you know, it's been pointed out that we need to fix it, so I say fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| And the way to do that is to move forward with it this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| And then as far as Mr. DelVopi's part about the number, you know, I don't have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| I like a number, but I would also like to entertain perhaps a percentage on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| because you can always have an incident, for example, if you ran for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| there would probably be 100,000 people come out and vote, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| That's probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I would say, you know, to put you in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| And, you know, if you use, for example, the number of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| Until I get my hip boots on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| If you use the number of perhaps a lower number of like how many folks voted in a mayoral election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| then that could be a huge number or you could do that and you could do a cap with a percentage, a lower percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| So, you know, that's yet to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| You know, we've got some detail there to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| We'd like to see this move forward tonight, even though, you know, it's just on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and we've got plenty of time to discuss it in between time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| And I think that's a fine idea, that if you wanted to say a number or a percentage, whichever is greater or whichever is less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| or something like that, something that you understand here's the hurdle you have to jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| I'd like to piggyback on to the comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Personally, I'm not excited about referendum because I've lived in California to Proposition times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| and Proposition 13 was a disaster for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| However, having said that, I think referendum and recall are tools that citizens need to have at their disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| if government is not responding to their needs or there's an official who's been elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| who is not carrying out the duties of the office appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| I, too, think that the 15% of the registered voters is much too high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| because we typically have, if we took a trend over the last 30 or so years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| I think about 30,000 people on the average vote in a mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| If we have a good mayor who's running for re-election and doesn't have opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| fewer people will be inclined to turn out to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| So that will skew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| But I would like to have us, as we're doing this looking, to look at what is currently stated harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2287)|
| 0:38:16| and that's 30% of the voters in the last mayoral race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Sometimes that would require maybe 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| Sometimes it might require less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| The bottom line is if we on city council are doing an effective job in carrying out the wishes of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| then the referendum won't be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| And if an elected official is doing the job, recall will not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| So there is a procedure for avoidance, I guess, in doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| But I think Councilman Bailey stated this a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| that government by referendum as a practice is not a healthy practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| But I think we do need to do this and get both recall and referendum in an aligned, compatible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2334)|
| 0:39:03| It's a safety valve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey, then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| We need to clear this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| But I think the real issue is probably the issue of are we going to try to move on it tonight or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| because, as was mentioned earlier, there are only six members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| And that's probably the debate we ought to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| I definitely have some things to say about it, and I think we probably ought to hear the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| But that's probably what we ought to discuss first to see if we're going to try to move on this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| And I'd like to hear from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Anybody want to speak to that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Or do you want to just on whether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Let me just say further that, you know, we do have an issue, a group, an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| that timing is of the essence, I believe, for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| And the way I'm going to look at this is on the issue of the referendum issue itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| And I, for one, don't think we necessarily need to get into a hurry on how this all works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| because I think it's a – whether it's a number or a percentage or how we do this is very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2411)|
| 0:40:19| Because since I've been in Knoxville the last ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| we've had a number of referendums that have been put on the ballot that turned out, in my view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| and probably in the view of the majority of people, to be a bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| And I haven't looked into the exact percentage or number of how many referendums passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| but most people go to the polls and they don't really – haven't taken the time to look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| and educate themselves on exactly what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| And at some point, I'd like to go into that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| So I'm of the opinion we've postponed a number of issues because of the absence of one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| and we have three that are not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| And this is a very crucial issue, so I'm going to be leaning on the side of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| I did want to add one thing, and I think Councilman Bailey's remarks triggered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| and that is that there is an interesting aspect in the initiative referendum section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| and that is if the petition is completed and certified and the numbers, whatever they are, are gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| that the council has the power to adopt the proposal as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| and avoid the cost and effort of going to an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| In other words, they can adopt the citizen's proposal outright and make it the law of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| So I think that's an interesting aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| But it is important, and I agree with what Councilman Bailey said, at least to this extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| that this is an important tool for citizens to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| If you feel your government is not doing the job that you need it to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| you have to have a tool to bring something to the attention of the other voters and get action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| So I think we ought to do it, you know, wisely and well as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Well, I agree, essentially, with Councilman Bailey, because it's an important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| and I think that we need to have as many councilpersons present to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| And I don't think we need to rush, although some people have initiatives that they want to see come forward pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| But I think we don't need to rush on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| and allow as many councilpersons as can be here to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Well, I thought we were going to debate whether or not we were going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| It seems like we're going into the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| But, you know, if it's important, and it is, then, again, we'll miss a two-year window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| So, I mean, either it's important or it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| We need to determine that it is, because it's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And, you know, I wouldn't bet on it every time, but I feel pretty confident that it's been our standard that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| we went ahead and passed it on first reading and then have the discussion later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| So, regardless of whatever's before, you know, whatever outside interest, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| my feeling is not about trying to rush those projects or whatever's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| It's about we're going to miss a two-year window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| So, you know, if it's that important, then we need to move forward with it, have some debate on it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2606)|
| 0:43:34| and then the other ones are going to have to catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I mean, it's just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| So, either here or you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Mayor, if I guess this is to the Law Director, if and when we pass this, the Law Director writes the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2623)|
| 0:43:53| Because I know, you know, some of the other issues that have been on the referendum that were county sponsored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| there was some question to how that was written and was it, did it look favorable towards one side of the issue or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| And I think that's something that we probably ought to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| You're saying the question on the ballot itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Because, you know, you go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Yeah, they're hard to understand sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| And sometimes they're lengthy and sometimes they're biased, depending on which side of the issue you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| So I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| We actually work with the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| They prepare it and then we review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| There are at least two folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I'm going to call on them, not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| First is Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2672)|
| 0:44:43| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| I appreciate the opportunity to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I have some documents I need to show you and my son, Teddy, is passing those out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| But before I begin tonight, I'd like to ask you a question or ask a question for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| Whose government is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| The most fundamental right of citizens is the right and the ability to address their government representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| Should that right be tampered with, can we really say that we even have a representative government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| The government is the people's government and our representatives are exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| They represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| They do not rule over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| It is not their will we bow to, but the will of the people that is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| A group of people came to our city government to address what they considered a violation of their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| When no compromise could be found, the only remaining course of action was a petition for ballot referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| We were told by city government and the Knox County Election Commission that we would need to collect 1968 signatures on petitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| to place a referendum on the election ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| After a great deal of time, effort, and energy, we submitted our two petitions for ballot referendums for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| only to be told that the number of signatures specified in our city charter was wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| and that the number would actually be 15,200 signatures, an increase of 772%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2771)|
| 0:46:21| I want you to see this letter from Greg McKay to Charles Swanson from 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| It shows definitively that both Mr. McKay and Mr. Swanson knew in 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| that the city charter section 709 needed to be amended to be legal and whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Yet in that same year, 2003, and again in 2006, this very same section of 709 of the city charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| was amended by charter amendment at the ballot box for other defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| But the number of signatures required was ignored both times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| This is why we are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| This must be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| A bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| In 1971, city judges election, the total votes cast were 31,998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| At that time, this provision was based on 30% of the previous city judges election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| So the required signatures to place a referendum on the ballot that year would have been 9,599.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| The city charter was amended in both 1981 and in 1982| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| and changed this provision basis from the city judges race to the mayor's race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| But in doing so, the 30% of the past election standard remained the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| So at the time of those amendments, this provision would have been based on the 1979 city of Knoxville's mayoral election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| and in that election, the total votes cast for mayor was 31,078.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| 30% of that total was 9,323 signatures required to place a referendum on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| Our group took the responsibility to repair this defect of section 709 of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| We went to a local attorney, created this ballot amendment I show you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| I personally met with Councilwoman Marilyn Roddy and asked her to review the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| and that if she agreed with it, to then present it to city council to be voted on in time for the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| Councilmember Roddy took it upon herself to change this amendment so it matches the state standard of 15% of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| An impossible standard for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| We see this as a gross violation of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Is this representation of the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| To not only take the work of a local citizen trying to repair a defect in our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| but to change the work to ensure a standard that is impossible to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| With what Councilmember Roddy has done, it will take 2.3 times more people than actually voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| in the last mayoral election to place a referendum on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Is there anyone among you who can say this is fair and just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| This is an egregious assault on the right of the people to seek redress of their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| Some people have said that the government by referendum is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| But the concern that the 30% standard is too low turns out to me and to us to be factually inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| Thirty more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Let me just finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Between 1970 and 1997, when the standard was 30% of the election totals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| there was not one single citizen-sponsored referendum effort that made it to the election ballot in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| There were three sales tax referendums and, of course, they were government sponsors and came through this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| I've come here tonight to ask this city council to restore the right of the people of Knoxville to redress our city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| What Councilmember Roddy has done is to punish the people who vote in city elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| I can think of nothing worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| In the last mayoral election, 93.5% of the registered voters in our city chose not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=2997)|
| 0:50:05| They did this because they believe the vote doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| And if this modified charter amendment from council, Member Roddy will prove them right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| I ask you to restore the rights of the people of the city of Knoxville and to restore the trust that has been broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| John Inlow, I'm not sure if I have that right or not, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3022)|
| 0:50:37| No sweat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| Take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3038)|
| 0:50:50| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| My name is John Inlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| I live at 2921 Walmart Drive, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| And I'm here to say that I also disagree with the 15% of registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3058)|
| 0:51:06| I looked up and talked with the Election Commission today about the numbers of voters in the last five general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3066)|
| 0:51:15| And the 30% of the average of those five elections would be just over or just under 3,170 votes or 3,170 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3075)|
| 0:51:32| That begs the question, why is it that we would need 15,000 signatures in order to get something on the ballot when in 2007 we had 5,677 voters that voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3092)|
| 0:51:50| In 2005, 8,756.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| In 2003, my God, it was over 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| We had 13,538, which is still less than the number that we would need today in signatures just to get something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3117)|
| 0:52:07| We need a base number, not a percentage, not let's figure it this way, let's figure it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3127)|
| 0:52:15| Let's set it in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| And let's set it reasonably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Yes, we don't want nuisance referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| I think a number, say 3,000, if 3,000 people in a community this size think that something should go to the voters, then certainly let's put it before the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3144)|
| 0:52:39| The argument that Councilman Bailey had has been used for other groups of voters throughout history that, well, they're not really informed enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3159)|
| 0:52:51| They don't really take enough time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| We know better than they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| We need to be able to put something out there that is of importance and interest to the people, not just the politicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3176)|
| 0:53:08| And I think that changing it to 15% of the registered voters, which the number I got today is 97,476 voters here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3188)|
| 0:53:20| That comes out to 14,622 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| That's more than voted in the last four general elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| You guys really need to be a little more realistic in what it takes to get something on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| And that's pretty much all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| I think one thing I want to be very clear about here is, you know, my intent is to correct a deficiency, to correct a miscommunication or a problem that we have with our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3226)|
| 0:53:57| And looking at this, the ordinance is written the way it is because that's the standard that we're under currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| This ordinance doesn't ask for a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| It simply clarifies that the standard that we are under by the 1997 state statute is, in fact, the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| so that when a citizen does want to redress their government and they look at the charter, they know what the standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| I think part of the reason for coming together for debate is to say, okay, that standard that we have been under since 1997, 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3260)|
| 0:54:29| is that the standard we want to continue with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Certainly that's open for debate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I think picking some kind of standard that has predictability and balance and reasonableness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| we've heard a lot about balance and reasonableness tonight, is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| I think one thing we may be missing in this conversation is that when the 30% of participation in the mayoral election was written in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| we didn't have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| And term limits has certainly affected the ebb and flow of elections in a way that was not present prior to that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3295)|
| 0:55:04| In addition, when you pull the numbers, of course, with the mayoral election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| another change in our charter since that time is that a mayor can be elected with 50% plus one vote in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| So you've got to pull those primary election numbers, you know, to see where that lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| So I'm certainly open to amendment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| Again, my intent, as several of my members, my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| is that we have a standard that achieves that balance of reasonableness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| that government by referendum is not responsible governance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| but citizens certainly need to have an ability to redress their government when there is a serious concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| So we need just to find that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| I move to amend the ordinance in 12A so that, as corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| it would read that the requirement is for 5,000 signatures or 5% of the registered voters as of a date certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3355)|
| 0:56:05| like January 1 of the year, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| And I say greater because I think there's obviously a chance and a likelihood over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| that the numbers of city residents will change with time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| But right now, 5% is about 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| And by saying whichever is greater, if we end up with 120,000 or so residents or registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| that might shift upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| But that's a substantial number of citizens who are agitated enough by whatever its government is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| to ask for a vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| And I think a number certain is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| I think the threshold needs to be lower than it is in the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| 5,000 or 5%, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Mayor, I wanted to ask, see if we can get a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Mr. Schwartz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| The date certain would be as of January 1 of the year the petition is certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| So we'll know exactly, exactly when we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| And the certification comes by the Election Commission saying it's good to go to go get signatures out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| Do we know what the county's, anybody know what the county's threshold or number is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Councilman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| On the recent election last Thursday, there was a charter amendment to this effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| and I spoke with Greg McKay today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| and the threshold in the county for petition was 15% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| And I confirmed with Mr. McKay that that was not because of the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| but because that was what was present in the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| And the county commission brought an ordinance change, a charter change to the voters last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| which passed, which lowered that threshold to 10% of the registered voters in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| There are, let's see, 253,000-some voters in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| So 10% is about 25,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Mr. Swanson, I hate to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Do we have any sort of a history on referendums since, say, 2000 or since 97?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| I know we talked a little bit about this, but do we know any more than we did earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| I really don't have any more history than what you and I discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| I could go back and look it up, but my memory is just not that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| But it's changed off and on, I think, hasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| What has changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| A recall percentage or threshold and then the hotel referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| Well, our charter has been the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| But then when the state addressed this, when the state addressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| the state is the entity that imposed the 15% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| And the state gave the municipality the opportunity to have a lower number than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| if they desired to have a lower number than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| But they had to adopt a change to their charter to that effect subsequent to some day in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| Why one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| That would be some day in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| That helps me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| For the clarification, it is fair to state also that the state does not require a home rule entity like Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| from having any minimum or maximum number if they choose to adjust their charter by vote of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| The rules are, I'm not being hard on you, five minutes and then it's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Somebody from council would like to call on you, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| But we have rules and we're going to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| Mr. Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| As far as I'm aware of, first off, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| the ten percent charter amendment that just passed is in regards to a recall effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| It does not involve a petition referendum effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| My understanding is in Knox County I don't believe there is actually language that allows for a private petition referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| As far as historically, from 70 to 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| there were no citizen-involved referendum petitions that made it to any of the ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| That's according to the Election Commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| From 97 to the current date, my understanding is the only citizen-involved petition that made it to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3629)|
| 1:00:39| Now, I may be staying corrected on what Mr. Della Volpe said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| My understanding is the only one that made it was, of course, the hotel referendum in 03-04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| And as we know, Mr. Haney spent, some people say, a quarter million dollars getting that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| and hiring a company to hire those or, you know, collect those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| So that actually goes directly to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| He had to meet the standard, the state standard, as we understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| because they knew at that time that the 30 percent standard was not sufficient or was overruled by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| I just wanted to mention while Mr. Peabody is up there, my memory was, and this was in the early 90s, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| that we were out pounding the beat, collecting signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| We then came to a meeting of the city council as a group and spoke to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3686)|
| 1:01:34| and urged them to take the pain from us and to actually do the right thing and adopt the no new billboard ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3694)|
| 1:01:44| And they did that that night after some several hours of wrangling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| And so we never took the petition to the actual voter stage, but it was a substantial, substantial effort with lots of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3708)|
| 1:01:58| This was not, you know, doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| It was not a moneyed entity funding, you know, poll seekers going out there and beating the turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| We had people that gave their personal time going around, citizens trying to do what they thought was the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| when they thought their council wasn't doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| And I think that's a healthy part of our governmental system, that the citizens can at some point say, no, Moss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| I want the people to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| And I think that's a fair safety valve to have in our charter, and I support that notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| I'd like to offer a substitute amendment to this ordinance, and that would be to offer a 10 percent of registered voters threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3754)|
| 1:02:42| And the reason for that is if we look historically at voter participation in mayoral elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| which has been the benchmark in the past, we've seen up until the time of term limits about 30,000 people out of nearly 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3768)|
| 1:02:57| out of 99,000 voters participating in an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| And so if you take a third of that, approximately 30 percent, approximately a third of 30,000 voters, you have 10,000 voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| So, you know, in essence, you're maintaining what that historical standard was within the city prior to term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| If you go back to the 2003 mayoral election, which was decided in the primary, just about 30,000 people participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| So I offer a substitute amendment of 10 percent of the registered voters in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Councilman Dallabope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Yeah, I just wanted to add a consideration, and that is anyone that's ever tackled these petition situations knows that you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| have to get about 20 or 25 percent more than the required number because after you have collected these piles of paper with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| signatures and addresses and dates, the election commission has to verify that they are genuine registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| and not someone who just thought they wanted the sign or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| And the reality is you always have to get a higher percentage than the absolute number just to be sure you've got your job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| So the higher you go, the tougher it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| I mean, I don't want to take the number higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| I think Nick is on to something with the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| It may not be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And, you know, if it's not, we can come back in two years perhaps or whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Well, in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| I mean, if it's saying that it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| But I would rather keep it at that point rather than make it harder because the goal here in everything that we've suffered through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3869)|
| 1:04:38| in our community, I don't want to make it harder for your average citizenry to be able to not be able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3878)|
| 1:04:48| to not have to bring in professional pollsters, to have to spend all this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| It should be a process to where your neighborhood groups, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| if it was an issue that they were really concerned about could join together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| and get this done without having to bring in professionals, without having to spend thousands and thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| So I think Nick is closer to the point than the 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| So I want to vote against that amendment and stick with the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I agree with what Councilman DeLaValle and Councilman Pavlis have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| that the 10% threshold is a little high, particularly in light of the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| that you do have to collect substantially more signatures than that minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| And I think that pushes it back into the threshold of not being attainable for groups who don't have deep pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| to hire professionals to come in and collect the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| And I think this is a great debate and it's been a long time coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| because we've seen here in the county some things happen that, after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| I think the majority of the public would disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And one of the questions I always had is, to me, as hard as it is to get people out to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3961)|
| 1:06:10| if you can go take a petition to a shopping center or to football games for an indefinite period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| it seems to me it's a lot easier to get signatures of registered voters than it is to get people out to actually vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| And one of the things that I've strongly felt, you know, we ought to always let the people decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| It's the peoples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| We represent the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| And the people know best, so why not have it on a referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| But as I've watched referendums come and go here, it's a tough debate to, for me as an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=3999)|
| 1:06:49| to go out here and run for office and to get elected, to pass it off on a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| I just don't think that's the right way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| But I do think that if you don't have a government that is open and has public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| and public debate and exposure and the public gets hoodwinked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| or they pass some sort of an issue or law or ordinance or whatever that is terribly unpopular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| it's not a problem to get the public motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| You don't need a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| You don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| The motivation would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| So I do think that we ought to have this threshold somewhere where you can't go get some money together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4042)|
| 1:07:32| and go get a group to come out here and to put something on the ballot that the public doesn't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| hasn't taken the time to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| And there's a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| I could go on and on, but I think the threshold needs to be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| And so I'm not going to vote for any less than the ten percent, but I would vote for the ten percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| because if we're going to move towards a compromise, I think that's where we ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| But I just don't believe that we ought to run our government by referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| and pass tough decisions off on a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| The substitute motion that's on the floor right now is ten percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| Which goes first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| Well, the substitute motion goes first and then we'll come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| Either if it passes, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| If it doesn't, we'll go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Five to dance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Takes five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| All those in favor of the substitute motion, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Do we have a roll call vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| I was about to say, let's go ahead and do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Okay, so the motion does not pass three to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Now we'll go back to the motion that's originally on the floor, which is five percent or five thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| And with a date certain of January 1st of the year that the petition is certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| I think, again, our debate tonight needs to be how do we set this up so that the rules of the game are fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4148)|
| 1:09:17| they are a standard that is achievable with some effort, but not taken lightly, an effort that's not taken lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4157)|
| 1:09:29| I think, you know, we want functional government, and a government that's run by referendum becomes dysfunctional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| And there are so many more productive ways with transparent, open government to address issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| I think a referendum, like we're talking about, should be a last resort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And in that regard, I think we need a standard that is achievable, but reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| And I don't think that the five percent standard is high enough, particularly given the history of our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| and looking at the 30 percent of voter participation, I think that the 10 percent is closer to where we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| And if the intent is to go back to that standard, then I feel like the 10 percent is where we ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| I just want to make sure that people know my position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| I want to be very clear that I do not support a government run by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| I mean, I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| And, obviously, that's not why we're sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| We all ran for office to be city leaders, and I think we do a good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| But there comes a point in time to where if we don't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| then we can't get it so far out there that people can't correct a wrong, can't right a wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| And that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| And it's not getting it out of the reach of the everyday people, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| without having to bring in professional pollsters and spending thousands upon thousands of dollars in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| of people that come into our community and knock doors and sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| They don't even have a stake in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| So I in no way support, you know, this government being run by referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| and I don't think anybody on this body does tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| And that's not what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| This is about representing the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| Call for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| I see a light, so we're just going to go ahead and move to the vote unless I see a light, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| Okay, we'll go ahead and roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| I want to make sure that I'm straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| The motion is to make it 5,000 or 5%, whichever is greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| and the number would be as of January 1st of the year the petition is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| And the reason for the greater is that the city population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| and registered voters may well grow over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| so the threshold will have to be higher so that we have at least 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| And just so everybody knows, the 5% is 5% of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Registered voters as of January 1, the year the petition is certified by the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| We'll do a roll call again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Okay, motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Okay, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Given the various opinions, all of which are valid on this council on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| I guess I come back to my original idea that perhaps this needs to be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| to where we have all nine of us around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| as we're debating the appropriateness of these various numerical thresholds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| I just really feel the absence of the three other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| I agree with Mr. Pavlis that if it needs to be fixed, it needs to be fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| and we ought to go on and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| but I just think we're severely hampered tonight by not having our three other members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| And obviously, you know, we have a wide variety of opinions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| So I'd like to propose that we postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Mr. Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Well, I mean, more than likely next week or the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| Councilman Grieve perhaps won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| It's probably more likely that he won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Councilman Brown has already stated he won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| So what do we do that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Do we just keep putting it off and putting it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| I mean, we've got to do the people's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| If people can't be here, I hate it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| I mean, I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| But that doesn't mean that this city stalls and spins while we wait for people to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| So, I mean, two members aren't going to be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| So, I mean, I don't think we're getting where we need to go on it by postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| Right now, the only motions on the floor have been defeated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| so we're going to move on to another item of business unless somebody brings something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4430)|
| 1:13:58| Let me suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Actually, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Ms. Mitchell has corrected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| She's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| There is a motion to postpone, which did get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| So that's actually the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| But go ahead, Mr. Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| I was going to say, since we are looking forward to working with our colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| whoever they are that show up in two weeks, if it would help the dissenters today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| if we had seven percent until we meet with our brothers, would you go with it so we have something accomplished today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| and then can take it up as a larger collegial body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Although that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| One of the two of you would be willing to talk about it or are we just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| Mr. Swanson, just to preempt a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| that would be a substantive change if they changed off of that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| You could go to seven percent tonight as a compromise between the two positions that were set out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| But if, when you come back on second reading, you leave that seven percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| We always take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Go to some other percentage other than seven percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| That's going to be a substantive change, which will throw you back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| I hate to be an auctioneer, but if we can get that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| and then move on to the substantive debate amongst the members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| I think we would have achieved something tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| I think we have aired the philosophical questions pretty thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| And I assume that our brothers and sisters out there are listening and trying to make up their own mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| But is that, is either one of you interested in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| I'll withdraw my motion to postpone if Mr. Bailey will withdraw his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| You know, I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| But I will speak to Mr. Pavlis's comments there because towards the end of the last council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| we started having where we were making changes and adjusting our agenda based on different council members' schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4531)|
| 1:15:40| And I'm not for that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| I think if, you know, if you run for office, this is your number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| And if you're not here, it's tough luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| And one could argue that we could use this to our advantage on a routine basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| If I count the votes right, I know exactly how to operate up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| But that's not the way we've operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| We've always been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| It's been a cordial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| We've always worked with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| And it really ties into this referendum business as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| But, you know, I agree with you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| We can't start working around numbers that are up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| If you can be here, you need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| I agree with Mr. Pavlis and Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| If I had something that was my special interest that I had worked with for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| and for some reason I couldn't be here, whatever the reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I would expect counsel to go ahead and act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| If my wishes prevailed, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| If they wouldn't, it would be my tough luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| And I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Having watched counsel last year as a candidate continually postpone things to adjust around schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| I thought was very frustrating, and I made some mental notes to myself then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| So I applaud Mr. Bailey and Mr. Pavlis for bringing this out into the open tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Well, and I'll speak to Mr. DelVolpe's comment about being an auctioneer and a compromiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| I just have watched our county and our city go through the referendum process, and I've been hoodwinked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4622)|
| 1:17:12| And I've voted, I've signed petitions that once I thoroughly examined the issues, I shouldn't have signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4632)|
| 1:17:21| And I think that if you have an issue or you have a body of elected officials up here that are making the wrong decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4641)|
| 1:17:29| there will be plenty of motivation to get the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| And so I think the threshold should be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| And I also, you know, think that that would probably only be used when you have newly elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| and there's going to be four years before you can vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I mean, we get elected and we pass, we vote and we deliberate and we make decisions and we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| And if people don't like it, they vote us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| And that's the way it's always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| But I just think this, I could give, I mean, I could go back and put together different issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4679)|
| 1:18:07| where I could micromanage the budget by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| And it could be done in a good way and it could be done in a bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| But it's a bad, bad thing to start lowering the threshold to where the governing body can be overruled by a simple number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4694)|
| 1:18:28| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Well, I think the main thing is to have a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| You want to have citizen participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| However, you don't want it to be at a very low threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| And you're going to have a whole lot of petitions all the time on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| But certainly I'm for citizen participation as much as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| But here tonight we've got 5 percent, 7 percent, 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| This is something we're going to have to really think about and look at the available statistics from the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| And one of the things that's crossed my mind in all of this is that the census, we're going to have to deal with that pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4743)|
| 1:19:12| I don't know what effect that has on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| It won't on registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| It will on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Well, it could have some effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| And that's something I think we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| And as a person who did work for the election commission and comparing those signatures, it's a very tedious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4764)|
| 1:19:32| And many of them are thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| And many people who sign these petitions, they're not registered or they don't have the proper address or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| So it's a lot of things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| But this is a good discussion that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| And it's better than talking about some of the other things that we have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| That's for the birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| Mayor, I think one of my colleagues said, you know, we've had a good discussion and we've aired this thoroughly tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| And I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| I think we still have a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| The motion on the table is to approve the ordinance as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| Fifteen percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| What did I miss there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| I thought Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Well, I guess technically I should have made a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I was asking for the sense of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Would it matter to them if I went to seven percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| I heard Bailey say no, that he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| Seven percent wasn't going to ring his chimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| And I think if you're moving the question, you ain't going with seven percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| So I didn't make the motion because it looked like in a world where there's six people in the room and we need five votes, we ain't getting nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4844)|
| 1:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Charles, just if you'll confirm, the original motion is what's still on the floor because the two amendments failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4854)|
| 1:21:05| So that's back on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Ms. Roddy has called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| And so we would then take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| We're going to go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| We have to vote on calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| So the vote then is to call the question, which means we would cease discussion at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| All those in favor of that, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Let's do a roll call real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| And Mr. Swanson, does this need five as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Anything to pass needs five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| So we're back to the discussion of the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| Mr. Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Well, I will ask in the interest of moving the ball forward and make the motion that we use the number 7,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| or 7 percent of the registered voters as of January 1 of the year that the petition is certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4917)|
| 1:22:06| I think that number is a little high, but I would like to see us be in a position to work with our colleagues at the next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| And I'm willing to throw that out and see if there's been any movement on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| If not, I guess we're at a stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| We're going to go to item 12B or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| I'll say that I will second that tonight just in the spirit of moving the ball forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| I do think that that's a little high and I wouldn't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| And I understand where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| So I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Now, discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| Well, let me just throw out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Councilman, I liked your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| We spent good time talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| But it's a critical issue about how government and representative government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| And it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| And, Councilman Pavlis, I liked your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| You said it shouldn't make it so that the only people that can pass it are those people who are professionals who are going in paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| Because we realize that, I mean, if you're going to get something done, that's one way to go get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| The flip side of that is we shouldn't make it so low that anybody can go out and hire professionals and get it done, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| So there is a sense of balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| And you have to be careful of either extreme there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| Because we say, well, I mean, it's pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| If somebody gets interested in something, they go, I'll put some money in here and I'll get it on the ballot real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| and, you know, we'll take a shot that way, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| So you've got the reverse problem, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| I have a stupid procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Do you have a vote or only when there's a tie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| Not only when there's a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| I think I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| I asked Ms. Poplar that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| I don't have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| My vote can't make it five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| My vote can only solve a tie, which won't come into play tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Four to four or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Four to four it could, but it can't in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Again, I'll second what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| And that is that I really do think that this is the people's government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| And I have been on that end of trying to go out on the street and getting the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| And it's a technical petition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| You have to sort of dance carefully on the head of the pen to get the petition approved by the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| And then you go out there and there are some people that say, well, I'll sign it because I know or like or trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| But if they're not registered voters, their signature is just wasted ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| And you picture a piece of paper with 25 signatures and start getting to 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| or, excuse me, to get into 5,000 or 6,000 or whatever the number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| that's a lot of people that you have to talk to and argue your case to to get those petition signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5064)|
| 1:24:33| So I think that for the average citizen, that's a pretty high hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Now, it may be what you said, that if it's low enough, somebody with the big bucks can get the pros out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| and really churn it up so there's a danger that it's too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| But, I mean, that's a lot of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| And so I'd like to see us take a stab at 7,000 tonight and then meet with our other colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| I'll move that question and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| And we've got a second, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| So I'll see if we can get anywhere with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| So the motion on the floor is 7,000 or 7 percent, whichever is greater as of January 1st of that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5098)|
| 1:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| I'm going to go ahead and go to, excuse me, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| In the spirit of compromise, I'll support this going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Like many of my colleagues, I don't think we're at the place that any of us really want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| Again, I think we need to come up with a good balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| And historically, I feel like 10 percent is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| It's very similar to the threshold that we were under for quite a number of years in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| And if you assume a 30,000 voter turnout and you take 30 percent of that, then 10,000 is very near that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| As a percentage of registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| it's the number that citizens countywide have just approved to amend the county charter coming down from 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| Again, my number one objective is to make sure that the charter is correct so that the rules of the game are evident to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5153)|
| 1:26:01| And second to that is that we come up with a process that is not only fair to all but predictable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| and produces good policymaking and good governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| And that's what I think we're all about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| One thing I think we've forgotten in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| if the referendum or we ever agree on a number to get it on the ballot, it still has to be approved by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| And there still has to be a real sales job on those who are in favor and those who are against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| I think we have to have, as we expect voters to have some trust in us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| that we need to have some trust in the voters that they will do the appropriate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| And it goes back to something I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| If we're doing our job, then these all become moot issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| There's a motion on the floor, 7 percent or 7,000, whichever is greater as of January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| We're going to go ahead and move to the vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| One more roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| That motion passes on first reading, five to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| and will be considered on second reading at our next meeting on August 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix A subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| regarding review agencies and the number and type of copies of a final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| or administrative plat to be submitted for review certification for recording and recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| Article IV, Section 3.1, to add nursing home as a use permitted on review in the RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| RP2, and RP3 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| We do have two people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Well, I was going to see if there's a second, then I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Right now there's not a second, so we'll leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| There's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Mr. Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| I guess I'd like to hear from MPC's Mark Donaldson how we got to this point in terms of why we need to add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5294)|
| 1:28:22| to the RP1, RP2, and RP3 planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| It may be that it's a good thing that we start looking ahead as our population ages and where do people go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| and nursing homes is one of the places and destinations that we're going to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| The flip side is that the broader the menu on those planned residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| the more unlike kind facilities end up in a residential area without perhaps input from the neighbors that are being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5328)|
| 1:29:00| And so, as I understand it, and I may be incorrect, right now you can have a nursing home if you come in for a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| and get office or commercial or whatever the test is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| but you go through the actual notice and hearing provisions that allow the citizenry to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| So, Mark, if you would educate us on how we sort of why this is going into RP1, RP2, and RP3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| what's the thinking of the MPC as to why this should be in the menu for use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| It would help us understand what we're looking at here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| One of the fastest growing markets in the housing development business is housing oriented towards our aging population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5379)|
| 1:29:49| And those people who are aggressively pursuing that quite often try to put a variety of housing types within an individual development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5389)|
| 1:29:59| that cater to that market niche, including higher density, smaller yard houses, condominiums, apartments, assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5399)|
| 1:30:13| and more and more nursing homes are a part of that mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| Currently, the RP1, 2, and 3 zone districts allow the variety of housing types up through assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5417)|
| 1:30:27| but not including nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| Our R1A and R2 zone districts include both nursing homes and assisted living facilities as uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5431)|
| 1:30:47| Two requests for large RP1 zoning changes in the last several years have involved a project that involved a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5447)|
| 1:31:01| And if you are to comprehensively plan that district, we would like to do it all at once under the planned residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5461)|
| 1:31:11| rather than requiring a second rezoning step simply to address the nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5471)|
| 1:31:19| Quite literally, you could use the RP1 zone district to do higher density housing, apartments, condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| assisted living facilities but then have to rezone from whatever it was to R1A or R2 in order to do the nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5487)|
| 1:31:38| So we are simply, this proposed amendment simply adds nursing homes to the list of uses that are permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5498)|
| 1:31:49| As such, it would be subject to all of the same notice requirements that exist for changing a base zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| for the development plan approval and the use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| So it simply saves a step and allows for the coordinated approval of the entire plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5523)|
| 1:32:14| if they wish to do nursing homes as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| You're saying that they're building a little village, if you will, that has everything from single family, multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| and ultimately assisted living and nursing homes as kind of a full range of the population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| We've had two requests for that type of a project in recent years, one at Dean Hill in the western part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| and then, if you recall, Victor Jernigan's project off of Buffett Mill in the eastern part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| Both of those envisioned nursing homes as part of that mix of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| And most recently, the Dean Hill people have come through and rezoned a portion of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| and have talked about adding a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| And our response was, well, you would have to change your zoning from planned residential to R1A or R2 in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5581)|
| 1:33:11| What does that do in terms of community input to that decision-making process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| If a change of zone as opposed to an allowed within the zone on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| what does that do in terms of the citizens' rights to come in and say this is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| or bad for either the individual neighborhood or the surrounding area that's affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| The use on review has the same public notice requirements in our administrative rules as does a change of zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| So affected properties and neighboring properties would receive mailed notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5623)|
| 1:33:51| It would be posted in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| The signs would be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Everything is posted on our Web site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| The use on review allows the planning commission the approval authority rather than a rezoning being approved by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5639)|
| 1:34:08| but it also provides for a provision of an appeal of a planning commission decision to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5648)|
| 1:34:16| So there is that fail-safe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| But I guess the question, and pardon my ignorance because I'm not sure I understand yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| I see that you had like eight or so conditions that you have on Exhibit A about things you'll look at in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5663)|
| 1:34:32| I guess the question that arises in my mind is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| is the decision about whether to have it or not still on the table if it's part of a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| or have you already crossed that threshold and are you down to how high is it or how big is it or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| how does it fit in and become compatible with the surrounding uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Have we taken out one step, which is do we want it or not, and then what should it look like is the second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| Are we down only to the second question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| That's what I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| What's the effect of putting it in as a permitted use under the RP label?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| We're not putting it in as a permitted use, and that's the key phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| Within the RP1 zone district, there are uses that are permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| and then there are a second column of uses that are uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| And for those uses permitted on review, the planning commission has the authority to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| So both questions remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| The difference is whether it comes to council or not without an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Is that the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| In zoning, if it was a zoning change, it would necessarily come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| If it's a use on review, it comes only as an appeal from an objection to your all's decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| The use on review is a zoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| But the approval authority rests with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| The approval authority has been granted, delegated by the council to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| but the council has held on to the authority to consider appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| I think you've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| I guess it's time to hear from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| We have a couple of folks signing up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| I'm not sure they're both here, but Charlotte Davis is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| If Terry, I don't see Terry Faulkner, but Terry, if you're here, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| I don't see her either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| I'm sure everybody's ready to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| First, let me, Charlotte Davis, 104 Crawford Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5783)|
| 1:36:30| First, let me say that I am certainly not opposed to nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| I am retired from the nursing profession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| and am well aware of the importance of having adequate and quality facilities for the care of seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| But I am opposed to the potential proliferation of nursing homes if this amendment is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5806)|
| 1:36:54| Nursing homes, as has already been pointed out, are already permitted in Zones 1, R1A, and R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| If nursing homes are permitted in RP1, 2, and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| it will mean that the dwelling units per acre can range from 24 in RP1 to 80 in RP3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5828)|
| 1:37:19| Therefore, the size of a nursing home in a residential area could be quite large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| And should there not be a cap on the height of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| since it might be adjacent to or across the street from homes of one to two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5850)|
| 1:37:38| In an earlier discussion regarding this proposed amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| a suggestion was made that nursing homes should be part of a complex going from self-care to assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5862)|
| 1:37:51| and then into a nursing home facility such as Shannondale is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| This is a legitimate suggestion and one that should be considered, but not in RP1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| Other reasons that a nursing home would have a negative impact in a residential setting includes increased traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5886)|
| 1:38:16| including employees, families, and visitors, service trucks and ambulances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5896)|
| 1:38:24| including those making emergency calls, and increased lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| A standard regarding this proposed amendment states that the use will not significantly injure the value of adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5910)|
| 1:38:39| or detract from the immediate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| Well, if you are a property owner adjacent to the nursing home, any change in property value will be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5922)|
| 1:38:52| It was also stated that a rationale for this amendment is that the overall impact of the change is small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5932)|
| 1:39:00| in that the residential zones of RP1, 2, and 3 comprise only a small percentage of the 58 square miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5940)|
| 1:39:10| of residential districts in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Again, if you have a home in that small percentage, it can have a significant impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| It seems to me that we are getting closer and closer to a universal zone where anything can be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5961)|
| 1:39:31| Is this what we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| You will soon be considering the proposed R4 zone, and today you will be considering an addition to the RP1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5974)|
| 1:39:45| I ask that you deny this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| I don't see anyone else, so we'll go back to the discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| I'm going to go to the vote if I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190810?start=5997)|
