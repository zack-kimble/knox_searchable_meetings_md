| 0:02:15| Council, before we move on to number five, I'm looking at the sign-up sheets for the item of 12H, which is the Hollywood Road rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=135)|
| 0:02:27| There are a number of people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Typically, by council rules, you listen to three people on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| For this case, for this one, there are five individuals signed up to speak for, 12H, and six signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=155)|
| 0:02:48| Do you wish for them to choose their three representatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| Mayor, I'd suggest we, if we could, maybe have all of them have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| What was the time limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Typically, it's five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| It's five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| I'm obviously talking to other council members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| I'd like each of them to have an opportunity to speak, but maybe have a shorter period of time to get their points out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=186)|
| 0:03:13| But I just want to make sure everyone gets their chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| What would be a fair amount of time then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=196)|

| 0:03:22| So those of you who are signed up to speak for 12H, the Hollywood Road rezoning, please, if you've got written remarks, please scratch out some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=202)|
| 0:03:31| It's more than three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| We'll do three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=213)|

| 0:04:45| For the mayor's report, I want to first say that this was a milestone week for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| About 100 family members, police officers, city staff, and city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| officially celebrated the promotions of our Police Chief Eve Thomas and Deputy Chief Ron Green yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| It was a great honor to present the badges and to be able to provide some remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| to these two dedicated veteran members of our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| Cody Thomas penned the badge on his mother, our chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| and Ronald Green, Sr., a retired U.S. Army military police sergeant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| penned the badge on his son, the city's newest deputy chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Both Eve Thomas and Ron Green have 25 years' experience with KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| and they were both members of the 1993 recruit class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| Actually, there were four members of Class 93A who went on to serve as deputy chiefs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| and we believe that's unprecedented in the city's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| Two of those deputy chiefs, David Roush and Eve Thomas, were later appointed police chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| So in addition to Chief Roush and Thomas and Deputy Chief Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| the fourth member of Class 93A to be named a deputy chief was Kenny Miller, who was promoted in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| So that's quite a record for that particular class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| So I want to thank Chief Thomas and Deputy Chief Green for their years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| and I wish them luck in this new role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| So that was the highlight to start the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| On Friday, we'll finish the week on a high note with a graduation ceremony for KPD's latest recruit class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| So please join me at 4 p.m. this Friday, August 17th, at Laurel Church of Christ, 3457 Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| as we congratulate our 18 newest officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| Next week, we are honored to host approximately 300 participants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| comprised of mayors and their teams from across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| and they gather here for the fifth annual Cities United Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| We will be reflecting on and sharing ideas for successful strategies to build safe, healthy, and hopeful communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| Our partnership with Cities United has helped us develop our Save Our Sons initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| with the goal to reduce violence and create opportunities for our city's sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| So I look forward to hosting the 2018 Cities United convening here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| and I want to thank our Senior Director of Community Relations, Avis Reid, and her staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| and our communications department, and Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| all the folks who are working so hard with the Cities United staff to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| So there will be activities throughout the city beginning Wednesday, August 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=447)|

| 0:08:14| Over the years, his ministry and community outreach touched the lives of many Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| Again, that street dedication will be at 10 a.m. on Saturday, August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=500)|

| 0:09:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I just wanted to remind everybody that the second draft of Recode is out, and the first draft of the maps are also available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| You can find those by visiting RecodeKnoxville.com and review those drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| I also want to ask those who are interested in joining us, maybe that are here today and then also are watching us on TV at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=567)|
| 0:09:35| to try to plan to attend the Recode meeting on Monday, August 20th from 6 to 7 at the Dean Hill Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=575)|
| 0:09:43| That's located at 7414 Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| If you can't make that one, there's another one on August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| If you can't make the one on August 20th, you can make one on Thursday, August 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| which is also from 6 to 7 at the Tennessee Valley Universalist Church located at 2931 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| We've had a lot of good public meetings and just wanted to remind everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| especially when we had some coming out west, and hope you can join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Great. Thank you for that reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| Elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Keith Hogue to the Knoxville Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 18, Section 18-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| to prohibit amplified sound on public rights of way and public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| Okay. I would like to call on our law director first to explain where we are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Council members, in your packet you will see that in addition to the ordinance on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=645)|
| 0:10:52| that relates to this issue and dealt with amplified sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| the law department has taken into account a number of the previous comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| and done some additional research and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| and we have come up with a newly revised ordinance that was also included in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| and it would be our recommendation, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| that we substitute the new ordinance that has been prepared in lieu of the previous ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| that was submitted to city council as an appropriate measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you. And now I'll call on Bill Lyons, our deputy to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| to give more explanation on what this new one entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Mr. Stewartson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| This ordinance, we listened to the folks who had commented the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| and did a little more study, and, in fact, I reached out and discussed the previous ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| with a couple of the people who came and spoke to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| and we decided, indeed, that having it be based on amplification wasn't the best approach to this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| rather to have the volume itself, the decibel level be the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| and basically we have just refined the existing levels we already had in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| and have applied those decibel levels measured at 20 feet and clarified what that is in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| So this is now amplification is not the factor that is important here or that is addressed in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| Rather, we've kept the decibel level limits and have clarified what those are in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| and cleaned up some of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Let me just say, if you choose to go with the second version of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| rather than the first version of the ordinance, we will need a motion from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| substituting the new proposed ordinance in lieu of the previous ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| and if somebody wants to make that motion, that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Now, is that on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| It will be on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| So it will come back again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you for working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| Reading over it, I prefer the decibel level changes, but there are two sections in this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=790)|
| 0:13:18| and 18.3 seems to deal with everything that would go by the decibel level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| but then 18.4 are all of the different exceptions to those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| And to me, the exceptions to those rules really leaves it to the discretion of whoever is annoyed by the sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| going on or the activity going on, and it really makes me feel uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Well, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| I think this is typical of the way the ordinance is written in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| and allow for somebody to have noise right outside the residence or other places that cause disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| And we feel that this clause is, most of this language is already in the present code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| Anyway, the only additional word is disturbing or unnecessary noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| So there's nothing new here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| That has been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| And this is typical of the way these noise ordinances are construed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| to allow to be taken into account that that noise has directly affected somebody nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| Which is, once again, up to the person being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| This also includes drums and instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| So if somebody's not singing a song that somebody likes, they could file a complaint and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| this is disturbing noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Well, I can't disagree with those possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| but I'll say we've had these limits in place for years just like this, and we haven't had such a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| And then the drumming, if it exceeded the decibel level, would, of course, be impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| It would be disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Councilman Roberto, I was going to say, we have one person signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| I just wanted to say that I wanted to thank the administration for working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| and this clarification, I think, is a much better iteration than we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| And so I know there was a lot of work put into it, and so I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| We have one person signed up to speak on 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| That's Mr. David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you for being here, Mr. Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| As you know, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| David Hayes, 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| I just came out to speak about the sound ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| You know, it's difficult working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| It's difficult to approach somebody, say what's on your mind, have a productive conversation, and reach a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| It's difficult to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| But when we take away that opportunity and put in place of that an opportunity to call the cops to come and resolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=958)|
| 0:16:06| resolving issues that it's really just going to be resolved within a couple people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| You know, when we set a precedent of how we're going to deal with things, the city said we're going to set an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| on how we're going to deal with certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| We're leaving the opportunity for people to actually come to understandings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| Yeah, like noise, noise issues, noise complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Ultimately, we need to figure out how can we as Knox civilians work together and resolve some issues about saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| oh, we're going to cite this person, oh, we're going to call the police on these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| How can we not criminalize these people's speeches and what they're doing and work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| and be okay with being uncomfortable sometimes instead of the alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| Also with this, I want to bring up the fact that I've been a part of many protests in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| as most of you all know, protests throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| A lot of times what would happen is if you come up and the cops aren't having a good day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| they'll come up and say, oh, you're violating some noise thing, you're violating some noise thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And then usually it just takes after a couple minutes of going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| the cops lay you down and you're able to get along and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| It's not just, I'm a black person with crazy dreads, but it's not like everything I do is super militant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| I remember doing an action where it was mostly young white women, a lot of them in Planned Parenthood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and the cops came up and hassled it being like, sound this, sound that, because they had drums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| they had all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| And after back and forth, the cop was laid off and it was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| So given this ordinance, what the cops say is like, oh, but you're in violation of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| and this is more esteem, this is more reason for things to happen that don't need to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| At the end of the day, the quality of life of folks in Knoxville when it comes to sound is not terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| Passing this ordinance will not increase the quality of life enough to really warrant this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| And also the thing about street musicians and everything, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| there's going to be some street musicians, there's some folks out there that sound good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| There's some folks that you nod your head to and you're like, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| And sometimes there's some folks you're like, wow, I'm not with that style of music, would you please stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| But that's the thing about being in the community, being community together and being Knoxvillians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| you know, we've got to be able to respect people's free speech, their style, whatever they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| especially when it comes to the case of these folks making money, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Not everybody has the ability to get a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Not everybody has the ability to go to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Not everybody has the ability to be able to uplift themselves in the more traditional ways we've been told to uplift ourselves, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| So people go to all sorts of alternative economies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| And one of those is being a street musician, is busking, is playing for folks to get tips, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1113)|
| 0:18:41| And some folks already are heavily scrutinized today, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Like all it takes is the wrong brush, the wrong experience or the wrong look at a cop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| and that cop doesn't lock you all of a sudden out of the house with you all the time and saying after a while leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| you know, somebody, one person complains about you and all of a sudden like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| there's cops all around you the whole time and no one wants to donate any money because of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| things are sketchy right there, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| So we should be moving away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| We should be encouraging folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| And the last time folks would see, you know, folks from Asheville talking about the ordinance, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| Knoxville wants to be like Asheville in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| But one thing that makes Asheville cool is the street musicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| You know, people come just to listen to street musicians, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And like that's a part of Knoxville culture too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| So to put more restrictions, to give more lead way for criminalization of these activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| this is not a good look for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| It's not a good look for Knoxville and I don't think we need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| And if you all pass the other iteration, they have to go to another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| I'm definitely looking forward to looking through the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| But even after going through the new ordinance, even looking through that, I think my criticism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| my critique is still going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| So I would recommend not even like passing the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| I think we have enough information to say actually this is a move that we actually don't need in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| This is unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| People always start questioning the role of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Well this is one of those times where it's like it's the role of government really to regulate sound in this sort of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| and to prohibit and put blocks of people making money in for people's free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1211)|
| 0:20:35| It's technical stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So first actually what I need is a motion on the original ordinance, a motion to approve in a second just so we can get that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1238)|
| 0:20:46| and then we do the motion to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| That's what he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| That's what Will needs for us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| So we need to withdraw the original one that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| You can just do it by affirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Just assume there's withdrawn unless someone objects to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| I am assuming that the original is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Unless someone objects to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| So now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Okay, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| So now I need a motion to approve the original ordinance that was presented, the one that we're not recommending that you pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Now I need a motion to substitute the new revised ordinance, which again gets away, does not deal with amplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| It deals with decibel levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Motion to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| So now we're properly ready for more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| So I'm just trying to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| And I'm going to go back to in the course of being active in neighborhoods and through the course of a campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| hearing lots of feedback from people about disturbances, noises in residential areas, and police get called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| because somebody's allowed noise or continuing ongoing party, et cetera, bands playing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| whatever it might be is causing them to not be able to sleep or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| And usually it's nothing can be done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| It doesn't meet the decibel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| So that's under 18.4 was the existing ordinance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| That was already on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| It was already on the books, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| And I guess Councilwoman Sincerez was concerned that if somebody's playing noise or singing a song that I don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1342)|
| 0:22:33| I can call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| I'm just trying to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| I can call the police and say, this is disturbing my peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| I don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Will you cite them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| But in the past we've never been able to cite that successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| So I'm trying to figure out if that and how that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Because what I've heard in the past when neighborhood liaison officers talk about this, they're like, yeah, we come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| but it doesn't meet the decibel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| So I've never heard of instances where it was that's bothering me and people actually got ticketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| So I made a request to actually get a report of, you know, how many complaints are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| How many calls are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| How many tickets have been issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| How many times have police come out and measured and got nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| And I didn't get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| So I'm kind of confused as to how big of a problem is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| And in the past when liaison officers say, yeah, I came out and measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| and the decibel level isn't above the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Actually, one of the issues in the past has been having the necessary equipment to measure the decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1425)|
| 0:23:54| and the appropriate training of the officers in using that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| I think that now we have more equipment with which to measure the decibels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| and we do plan to do engage in some additional training of our officers with regard to how to use the equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| and to actually utilize the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| So it's our belief that with the additional training and the additional equipment involved in this, this will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| I mean, there's always going to be a tension, you know, between those who want to create the noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| in terms of enjoying themselves or in terms of living their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| and those who wish not to be disturbed by other people's noises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| That tension almost always is going to exist in a municipal environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| And so what we're trying to do is craft an ordinance that allows both sides of that tension-making situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1482)|
| 0:24:52| to be reasonable in their approach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| And so giving us the opportunity to measure decibels, if it's beyond the decibel level that's permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| you know, there would probably start off with a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| And then if the excessive noise was to continue following that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| then there would probably be some actual citations involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| And there would be an opportunity to test it in court to make sure that everyone's rights are being preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| in terms of how we enforce the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| But we have to have something on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And what we've tried to do is pattern our ordinance after those ordinances that have been tested in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| that have gone to court in the past and have survived legal challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| And the ones that we have seen that have done that very closely resemble the ordinance that you now have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1543)|
| 0:25:51| And, you know, trial and error, we'll try that and see if it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| see if it accomplishes what needs to be accomplished in terms of dealing with that tension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| If it doesn't, then we try something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| So as we move towards more mixed use, which is a mix of residential and craft breweries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| which is common in my area and vicinity, that's a common thing I get is the van's over there until late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| and I'm over here trying to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| You know, what's going to happen in that scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Are the cops going to get called a lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Is it not going to meet the decibel mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Or if it doesn't like the decibel mark and it still bothers them, is it a moot point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| It's not necessarily a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| What we may have to do is by trial and error determine whether we have the decibel set at the right level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| or whether we don't have the decibel set at the right level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| We have certainly utilized a decibel level that seems to be a prevalent decibel level in the ordinances that we've reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| and the ordinances that have been tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| If you have the decibel level too low, you don't accomplish anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| If you have a decibel level set too high, you don't accomplish anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| So we're trying to find that proper sweet spot for allowing people to live their lives in an undisturbed fashion reasonably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1625)|
| 0:27:15| and yet allow people who are engaged in businesses and things of that nature to engage in those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| so long as they don't do it in a way that creates unreasonably disturbing noises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| So, you know, there's always the opportunity to tweak the ordinance in the future should we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| But you've got to start somewhere and this is where frankly most jurisdictions across both the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| and the country that we have seen so far seem to be kind of centering on this decibel level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| and it has survived legal attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| I frankly don't know whether it really accomplishes what they want to accomplish or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Chief Thomas, to Councilwoman Ryder's point, is it possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| I know that we're going to be voting on first reading the ordinance this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| would it be possible for us to get the data surrounding complaints in the last maybe two to three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| or whatever is reasonable, at least 12 months worth of data maybe to all the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| for us to be able to review between now and the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| I think we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| You want the number of loud noise calls or excessive noise calls that we've responded to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| And if we could also see how many of those, what percentage turned into citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Councilwoman Sincerez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| I feel very comfortable with letting people live in an undisturbed manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| And I think 18.4 does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| I like the limitations of the 65 decibels and the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| My concerns come up with this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Even if the noises referred to do not violate the noise level standards set forth in 18.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| To me, that leaves discretion on do you want this person to be quiet or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| And you can use this to quiet someone, whether they're within the decibel level or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| or even if they are within the decibel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Well, there are certain noises and disturbing things that you deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| And, frankly, that's going to have something to do with enforcement discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| And we recognize that, and we're going to err on the side of trying to enforce it in a reasonable fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1787)|
| 0:29:57| If you don't do that, you don't have the opportunity to deal with issues that need to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1797)|
| 0:30:05| So, again, we're trying to kind of follow the example of others who have gone before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| and that's how they have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| And if we find that that doesn't work for us, then we change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| It just seems to throw a wider blanket than we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| That would be one person's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| There are other people who feel like we haven't cast as wide a blanket as we need to cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| Trying to hit the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Councilwoman Ryder, and then I'll call on Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Do you want to go ahead, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Actually, Councilwoman Singh-Perez, the part that you're questioning, if I'm reading that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| that's already part of the ordinance that's on the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| I just wanted to make sure that that's not what's being voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| What I was going to say is Councilwoman Singh-Perez's point is that the word disturbing is added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| That's the part in red, though my copy is black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| The line after that, even if the noise is referred to, do not violate the noise standards, level standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| My light is on to clarify that I understand that this exception only applies to horns and signaling devices on vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| steam whistles, exhausts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| My husband's car is a violation, I'll go ahead and tell you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| Drums and other attention-tracking devices, animals, birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| So my dog is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Sound trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| My children are, too, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Vehicles and pneumatic devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| So it doesn't apply to people's voices or singing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Do I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| I think you do, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| If you don't mind me responding to Councilwoman Ryder, the use of any drum or other instrument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| or device for the purpose of attracting attention by the creation of noise to any performance to show or sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| So that can cover a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| And I realize that this isn't what we're voting on, but I don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| You are, in fact, voting on the change that would add the word disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| But beyond that, the rest of it is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| I think you were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to vote for the revised ordinance that we presented to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1948)|
| 0:32:38| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1961)|

| 0:32:43| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| And the motion passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| That's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1968)|
| 0:32:58| 9B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 3, Division 2, Section 4-131 of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1978)|
| 0:33:15| City Code so as to amend certain distance requirements to coincide with newly enacted state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Is that an old light, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| 9C is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $1,500 from Parks and Recreation Department funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| and donating the same to the Boys and Girls Club of the Tennessee Valley to be utilized toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame dinner and induction ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Tool Design Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| LLC, for an amount not to exceed $150,000 for the Broadway Corridor Improvement Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| I just want to say I'm excited to see this project moving forward and the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| up and down the Broadway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| There's been a lot of feedback and a lot of work since 2013, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| And one of the big pieces of feedback for the area is how dangerous it is across there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| at Hall of Fame at Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| So looking forward to the public process as this moves along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| I can't see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| The vote didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I just want to ask Mr. Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| So what do we hope to get out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| What's the intended path?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| We talked about it earlier, but what's the intended path that we get out of spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| this money for this design review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| The intended outcome is to have some, to develop and explore some alternatives specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| for the Hall of Fame Broadway intersection that would make it less of a barrier, hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| not a barrier at all for pedestrians and cyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| As you all are aware, I'm sure, it's basically an interstate interchange in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| the city, which just really does not fit very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| It's dangerous and scary for a pedestrian or a bicyclist to approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2140)|
| 0:35:51| It also doesn't serve the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| You can't turn onto Hall of Fame if you're going north on Broadway, and you can't turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| left off of Hall of Fame onto Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| So there's a lot of issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| We'd like to explore some alternatives, take them to the community, and get them approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2165)|
| 0:36:17| basically get our strongest one approved, and that would go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| Part of the process will also be to analyze the technical details of how that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| It wouldn't go into full design, but ultimately we should end up with a proposal approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| by the community that solves a lot of the problems of the intersection and the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| immediately to the north there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| Have a proposal to move forward to funding in later years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| I think it's one of the broken major intersections in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Would you get a price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Would you get a typical budget that would move forward then, like a budget number that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| would be added to the street projects, capital projects on down the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| That would be part of the product for this contract, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2235)|

| 0:37:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| The 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with SmartWorks Partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| to perform program management and permitting services for small cell attachments within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| the city for an amount not to exceed $60,875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| So, Mr. Hager, I'm going to go back on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| So explain what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| We're actually outsourcing the permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So if I wanted to get a permit to add a small cell device onto one of our now utility poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| I would actually contract through this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Yeah, this company has already analyzed opportunities for installing this kind of equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2299)|
| 0:38:28| and the kind of legal constraints that we have for permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| So this contract would give them, well, they would basically be supplementing our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2312)|
| 0:38:42| in making that process happen, doing the legwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| They would still be overseen by city staff, but they would do a lot of the labor involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| so we wouldn't have to hire anybody to do it, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| And at this point, we don't really have a good idea of how many we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| because we're only permitting the subset of poles out there that have lights on them that we own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| and we don't know if that's going to be the preferred alternative to these companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| or if it's going to be down their list of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| So it's an annual contract that we don't know exactly how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| We've estimated it based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Yeah, and it's basically an on-call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And that's one of the advantages of forming it out is that we don't know how much time it will take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| so they'll deal with the staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| So it says that we're piggybacking a contract in place for the city of Hendersonville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| So how did that come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I might defer to Boyce, who is out there, on some of the details on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| but there are a lot of opportunities that we have for using existing contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| so that we don't have to go through our purchasing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| I don't know what the limits on that are, but Boyce can enlighten us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Yes, sir, Boyce Evans, purchasing agent for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Yes, state law enables us, gives us the authority to piggyback off of another local government's contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2412)|
| 0:40:21| as long as, A, we review it here in the city, which is me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| and say they competed at this open and fair and, you know, in the same manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| pretty substantially similar to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| And then we have the services that we procure off of the contract are substantively the same as that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2438)|
| 0:40:48| I thought it was the city of Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I'm forgetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Down in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Hendersonville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Okay, Hendersonville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| And I'll blend together there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| But anyway, the services are substantively the same and the manner that they competed it out are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2456)|
| 0:41:04| So that was the way to do it in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| We don't do a lot of piggybacking, but we do it particularly when time is kind of the essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| and it is right now because we've got a barrage of entities that are wanting to start getting small cell devices set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2488)|

| 0:41:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2492)|

| 0:41:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| It's on a roll tonight, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| I had too much caffeine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| So, Bill, we do get, I mean, this is a number of those spaces in the SunSphere under lease, and it's in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2518)|
| 0:42:10| I'm assuming it's in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| You're telling me it's in the lease that these are responsibilities of the landlord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| fix the elevator and other physical improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| We're getting some income off of this, too, at the same time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| We're getting over $40,000 a year in income, plus some utilities are paid up to a certain amount as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| and it's in obligations to those tenants but also to ourselves because it's the excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| We're very concerned about the excess to the observation deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| which is difficult right now because of problems with the elevator as well as for the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| We have some vacant space there now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Do you think this will make it more leaseable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| The whole space has been highly challenged by the condition of the elevators for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| Even though it's expensive, it's something we really need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| You think it addresses the number one concern with that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2581)|

| 0:44:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| The 11H as a resolution authorizes the mayor to request the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| to perform project management services related to three separate projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| Ed Cothran Pool Resurfacing Repairs, Fulton High School Tennis Court Resurfacing Repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| and Harriet Tubman Park Tennis Court Resurfacing Repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| for a total amount for all three projects not to exceed $610,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Okay, Mr. Law Director, would you like to explain what we need to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Yeah, we've got another amended version to consider tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| It really hasn't changed that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| It's still $610,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| It's still work at all of these locations that you have seen before, and it's still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| If you looked at the background on the AIS, that's really the work that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| It was kind of confusingly stated in the agenda summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and so what you have is a revised agenda information sheet that kind of fixes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| so that the agenda summary is no longer confusing, and also more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| in the resolution itself, in the caption of the resolution itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| it sets out the work that is actually being done for the $610,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| It's still set out separately, as you can see there, but in order to have this completely correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| our preference would be that you substitute the revised, the amended version of Resolution 11H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| for the one that was in your original packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| So if someone is willing to make that motion, we would be grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| It's not really an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| It's a motion to substitute the revised 11H for the one that was previously furnished to you in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| Motion to substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| It's really the same work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Motion to substitute revised amendment package 11H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Okay, I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I'm going to ask Will just to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| This is a resolution authorizing the mayor to request the public building authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| to perform project management services related to three separate projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| One, Ed Cothran pool resurfacing repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Two, Fulton High School and Harriet Tubman Park tennis court resurfacing repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| And three, Harriet Tubman Park clubhouse and playground addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| for a total amount for all three projects not to exceed $610,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| 11I as a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply jointly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| with Knox County for an Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Award of $154,568| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| from the U.S. Department of Justice for improved operation of the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| and if such application is approved, authorizing the mayor to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| 12A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| appropriating the sum of $110,000 from the Historic Preservation Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| and donating the same to Knox Heritage for its Vintage Properties Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| to focus on historic preservation work in the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I just wanted to thank Dr. Lyons, Mr. Brace, Covenant Health, Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| leaders from the neighborhood in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| This is all part of, I talked about this at a previous meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| really a process of assuring that our health care needs are being met both in our region and in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| and that we're addressing some very real and important concerns in a neighborhood that's important to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| So I was wondering, Dr. Lyons, if you would mind just talking a little bit about what's happening with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2932)|
| 0:49:01| Certainly, and I want to also include Becky Wade, who's been incredibly helpful on this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| and she's actually implementing the ordinance that we want to make sure she's involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| in the stewardship of the Historic Preservation Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Thank you, Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| What this is going to allow is for Knox Heritage to be the agent to help to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| to affect the movement of two houses and do some other work as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| that are affected by the expansion of the Covenant facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| We have identified two sites and the hospital is participating also in paying for some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| And this will allow both for the houses to be moved and will also allow for the site to be prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| for them to be accepted by their new owners and then they will be put back into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| So we will move from a stalemated situation that has been there for years to productive use of the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| and then in private hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| So we feel very good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| And we haven't totally given up on the third house, so that's a serious challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| But the two of the major houses we do have taken care of with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| and Knox Heritage will be our agent to help do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| And we'll be using funds already put aside for historic preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| just putting them into this use on this occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| So we're going to vote on this and we've got an issue about another one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| We have to make sure we did it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| So this is on 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you for the explanation of what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| On 11H, we voted with Mr. Wallace made a motion to substitute the new version for the old version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3054)|
| 0:51:04| and the vote that was taken on that was in favor of substituting the new version for the old version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| We didn't then vote to approve the new version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| and so we probably need to take an extra vote on 11H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| with the motion having been made to substitute the new one for the old one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| Motion to approve the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Do we need to do that on the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Well, let's do that one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| We want to make sure we've got this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| A motion to approve the one that was substituted for the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| That's the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| I need a motion to approve the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Motion to approve the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3120)|

| 0:52:08| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Passes again 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| 12-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| 12-B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $1,750 toward the sponsorship of IMES Nature Center's Symphony in the Park annual fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3143)|

| 0:53:50| from Mixed Use Special District SC-5 to high-density residential for property located on the northwest side of East Young High Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3230)|
| 0:53:59| northeast side of Chapman Highway, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Councilman Lawless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| You're going to draw a breath there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| So I guess my question is, so you're going to eliminate the access out onto Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| That's been the recommendation, right, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| I just wonder if those other businesses will have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| We cannot eliminate it in talking to, excuse me, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3263)|
| 0:54:34| MPC does not want the access to be on Chapman Highway, and Elmington does not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| They will plan that on Young High Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| However, that access to Chapman Highway services other property owners, and there's really no way we can close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| But we will not be using that for access to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| So you won't be, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| That's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Other properties use that access now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| But the apartments won't have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Well, technically they'll have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| We haven't quite figured out how to do it, but we will certainly comply with MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| We cannot close it or block it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| But we will not use that as access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| It's not going to be your primary entrance, but it'll still be an ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| That'll all be on Young High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| But it'll still be ingress and egress out of that site on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Well, is that going to be subject to final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| That's not the way I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| The zoning we're asking for is a planned zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| If the sector plan, the one-year plan, and the rezoning are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| we go back to MPC at that time for a use on review, which is basically site plan review and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| We'll be working with them on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| We've discussed this with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| It came up after that restriction was put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| And MPC understands that we cannot legally close that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| I just wanted to say that I'm excited about this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| and I think John Shepard is here from Edmonton Capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| They've done a really great job of working with community development, working with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| working with neighborhood groups to sort of answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| and make sure that this project is understood by the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| Anybody who's been following what's happening in South Knoxville, you may be aware there's a lot going on over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| and property values are rising, as they are in other parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| So I really appreciate that we are being proactive about finding places that are close to amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| including public transportation, grocery stores, places where people can walk and have recreational amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| This particular site is adjacent to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| and I think that the developer has been working very closely with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| and with the neighborhood to assure that all of those things are connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| I also want to note that I'm not sure if council members saw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| but I just wanted to make sure it was in the record that the South Woodlawn Neighborhood Association Board of Governors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| sent a note of support for this project today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| So that came across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I think Will sent it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| So I think that speaks to how well this project has done as far as working with the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3459)|
| 0:57:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| I'd also like to piggyback on that and say that Ellington is also working on the project on Martin Mill Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| and has also worked closely with Lindbergh Forest and other neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And I just want to praise Lindbergh Forest Neighborhood and South Woodlawn for stepping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| and recognizing that affordable housing is something that we need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| We have wealth that's come in because of a lot of the urban wilderness and the south waterfront development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| and they recognize that there's room for everybody in Knoxville and in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| And so kudos to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| And it helps when you have a developer like Ellington who is willing to work so closely with the community to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| All right, so we have now to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| So, Arthur and John, you've signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| Is there more that you want to say now or just answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I think we're here for questions only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Okay, I do have somebody that has questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Kenneth McBride, are you here, Mr. McBride?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3533)|

| 0:59:16| And you have up to five minutes, and I'll set the timer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| My name is Kenneth Alan McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| My address is 114 East Young High Pike, where I have been residing since the middle 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3563)|
| 0:59:33| I just have these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I have provided a copy of these questions to John Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| He and I had a brief conversation, and I mentioned to him that this is not an opposition, and I'm not vehemently opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3580)|
| 0:59:51| I just have these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Here they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Question number one, is Edmonton Developers the same promoted at our district citizen meeting attended by our city council person, Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3594)|
| 1:00:03| Your name or are you representing Edmonton Capital Group of Nashville regarding the 121 East Young High Pike construction project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3603)|
| 1:00:12| Number two, what are your specific plans and drawings for ingress, egress, and pedestrian traffic regarding this proposed object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| Number three, is your plan still to develop 130 to 170 Section 42 apartments on this proposed site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3621)|
| 1:00:32| Number four, Mr. Hunter Nelson declared this project to be a public-private housing complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| Is that still true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Number five, are there tax credits, bond issues, housing vouchers, Section 8 applicants, et cetera, involved with your proposed project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3642)|
| 1:00:54| Number six, has Edmonton Capital Group made any consideration of the devaluation of the very nearby properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3654)|
| 1:01:03| and the terrible impact it will have on this small group of taxpaying citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| Number seven, who pays the cost for less than full occupancy regarding this complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| and will Edmonton manage the housing units or will they be dealt to a non-profit corporation like KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3677)|
| 1:01:26| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Kenneth Allen McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3688)|

| 1:01:33| I brought extra copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Could council receive these already or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| If you'd like to pass, maybe, Avis, would you mind grabbing this from him and passing those to council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3706)|

| 1:03:19| Edmonton CGLLC, applicant second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| Mayor, before making a motion on this, I wanted to maybe hear from the folks that were going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| and maybe have some opportunity for some questions first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| Here's our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| We'll start first with those who are for, who have marked that they are for this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| and it will be in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Louise Gorenflow, Aaron Bickneys, Arthur Seymour, John Shepard, Adam Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3825)|
| 1:03:56| And then we will hear from those who signed up against, David Williams, Stacey Veron, Amy Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3836)|
| 1:04:06| Mary Elizabeth Yates, Mary English, and Bob Cronick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| So that will be the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| And as counsel agreed earlier, I'll set the time for each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| You have up to three minutes, and I'll let you know when you're at about one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Will will get that from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Ms. Gorenflow, if you'd please state your name and address for the record, and you may begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| My name is Louise Gorenflow at 2306 Sunnywood Lane, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| I appreciate this opportunity to speak in support of the rezoning necessary for the affordable housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| by Elmington Capital Group on Hollywood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| The Elmington Capital Group appears to have complied with all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| for the development of 110 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| The building will not require a waiver of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan as a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| It will not disturb the slopes with the highest gradient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| And NBC has determined that the property could accommodate 130 units, 20 units more than planned by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| NBC has determined that the additional traffic will not have a significant impact on Hollywood Road's capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| and will not overburn the neighborhood schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And people living in the affordable housing also need affordable transportation, which is available near the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| Because our current zoning and the recently released draft recode Knoxville zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| discourages the development of small multifamily housing developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| Developers of affordable housing have no option but to build in the few remaining spots available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3945)|
| 1:05:53| If zoning excludes the development of small multifamily housing from essentially all residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| then we have to cite the construction of large multifamily housing in the slivers of land where they are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| Knoxville, along with most of the larger cities of our state and nation, is in an affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3967)|
| 1:06:16| The Elmington project offers an important lesson in the midst of the recode Knoxville process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| of how exclusionary zoning blocks construction of needed small multifamily housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| I urge you to approve the needed rezoning of C4 to RP2 for the Elmington Capital Group's development project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| I also urge you to consider within the recode Knoxville process allowing, by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| the development of small multifamily housing affordable housing within the residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| that band our transit corridors, leading to the many benefits envisioned by transit-oriented development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Okay, next is Erin Vickneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| And you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| My name is Erin Vickneys, and I live at 1905 Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| I'd like to speak about the need for affordable housing and urge everyone to support this rezoning so that the new housing can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| I'm someone who is a low-income person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| I work in health care and food service and child care, and I know that if I were looking for a house right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| I actually wouldn't be able to afford either where I live or probably anywhere in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| I've helped a number of friends who are all trying to move recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| and the prices of renting housing anywhere near the city is about double what it was maybe eight years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| when I was looking for a place, but I've lived somewhere about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| So I am grateful that for now that's still stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Another person's life I guess I'd like to show you is I'm a mentor through the AMACHI program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| which is like big brothers, big sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| And so I have been mentoring the same little girl for eight years now, although she's not little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| She's taller than me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| She was five when we first met, and now she's 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| So I've watched her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| Not only has she become taller than me, she's also become not just a volunteer gig but real family to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| So she's like a little sister, and her family is all family to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| But they are in a situation where the mom cleans two different jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| She cleans at UT during the day and at Target after they're closed at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| She's had these jobs for years, and she's a hard worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| But she has three kids at home, some kids who are grown, and then stepkids who live with her sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| They move about twice a year due to the lack of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| They usually are in a place for a little while, and it works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| and then it's hard to either keep up with the rent or the places that they can afford are not safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| or are substandard because of landlords who aren't paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| This is the first time that after having to move out, they actually had to be in a motel for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| And I think that shows the changes that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| So all these kids in one motel room all summer, they finally got into a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| but not in time for the kids to be in school on time, which is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| That's kind of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| They switch schools often and have to miss the first day of school waiting for a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| So I just want people to think about that's the situation, that's the kind of people who need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| Mr. Seymour, did you want to say anything or answer questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| And Mr. Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| If I may very briefly, Mayor Arthur Seymour, John Shepard and I are here on behalf of Elmington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| What you have before you tonight is simply a rezoning application on this property on Hollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| There's been a lot of discussion, I know, about traffic and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| We cannot get to those issues until the property is rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| Right now it is zone C4, which is a very general commercial district in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| It's the broadest commercial district you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| It does not require site plan approval, any public approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| All you do is meet the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| So before we can deal with traffic issues, water issues and other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| we have to have the property zoned from C4 to RP2 as recommended by the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| and we're here asking you all to do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| Mr. Shepard, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| State your name and address for the record and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| May I reserve my time for the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| I can call you after all of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| And the opposed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| Would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Actually, no, you need to speak during this process and then council members might call on you to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| I'm John Shepard, 118 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| I'm here on behalf of Elmington Capital, the developer of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| And I guess I would appreciate the comments that were just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| and I would like to say that we understand the concerns that some of the neighbors have voiced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4269)|
| 1:11:20| and it's our desire to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| So we understand that their homeowners or renters or small business owners are raising their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| and so there's a change that's being proposed for their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| and they very rightfully have questions about it, and it's my job to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| So I'd like to very quickly just go through a couple of the primary issues that have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| in the several community meetings that we've participated in so far and how we intend to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| The first one is the pond, the historic pond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| We don't have any plans to eliminate, pave over, or otherwise get rid of the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| In fact, we want to preserve it and restore it and honor its historical significance with a marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| Flooding on Hollywood Road has come up several times, particularly in winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| That's a concern that we've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| As part of our site plan approval, if we're successful here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| we'll actually be required to construct stormwater detention measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| that not only our development will not be permitted to make the flooding problem worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| we'll actually be required to improve the current flooding situation on Hollywood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| If permitted, our development, through the use of permeable pavers, underground detention systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| other kind of stuff that is frankly above my pay grade from an engineering standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| will actually improve that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| Density, that's an issue that we've heard a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| And in response to that, we've actually reduced the proposed density request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| from 30 units an acre to 24 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| We made that change at the MPC stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| With respect to traffic, as Arthur mentioned, we're performing a traffic study right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| MPC did a preliminary traffic review and determined there would be no appreciable impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| or worsening to the traffic situation on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| With respect to slopes, again, under C4 zoning, there's no hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| What we've agreed to do is put aside basically half the site in a non-disturbance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| and restrict our development to just the lower half of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| With respect to sidewalks and other kinds of public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| we want to be in a walkable, vibrant neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| and so we absolutely propose to construct new sidewalks or improve existing sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| in whatever manner that MPC recommends or requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| And as I said, Council may have more questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| And now also for the development, Adam Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Mr. Hughes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| My name is Adam Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| I live at 1119 Alexander Street, Apartment 1, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| I'm coming here to speak in support of this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| because Knoxville is in affordable housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| Right now we have over 2,000 families on the waiting list for Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| When you actually receive a voucher, only about 50% now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| used to be around 33% of people who get that voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| can actually find a landlord who will accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| I believe this year alone, based on my conversations with folks in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| we have lost over 700 units off the Section 8 voucher list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| so we are in the middle of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I live in Old North Knoxville, so I can only talk about what I see in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| I think it's not accurate that you can separate this into individual neighborhood issues, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| I see a lot of folks in my neighborhood without homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| my neighbors who would qualify for vouchers but are unable to find housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| I have friends who've had to leave Knoxville because of skyrocketing rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| Our population is rising, and we do not have enough affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| to stabilize our neighborhoods and to protect low-income residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| I do understand that there are concerns about how this affects neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| but these issues are going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| People aren't stopping moving to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| so we need to think about how we can spread that equally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| so all neighborhoods are able to take on a share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| So please, build affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Build it in Pond Gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Build it in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| Build it wherever you can, and do whatever you can to support affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| because right now, none of us are doing enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| We're going to hear from the folks who signed up against us, beginning with Mr. David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4552)|
| 1:16:04| You know the routine, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Mr. Williams, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| I'm honored to go first for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| That's unusual for Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| For the record, I'm David Williams, 505 Hollywood Drive, for us old-timers, Drive Not Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| I'm president of the Pond Gap Area Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| And as we said before, Hollywood traffic is a mess now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Please don't make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| And there are a multitude of potential problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Some have been mentioned, like flooding, security issues, and loss of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| I want to talk about the loss of community for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| I received an email from a young architect going to the University of Tennessee and his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| And he's going for his master's program in architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| He states, we support your cause to keep the apartment complex away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| We live in an apartment complex and do not enjoy how they encroach on neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| and we wish someday to get the heck out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| We support your cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| The Pond Gap has been and is a diverse community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| Amateur baseball games were played in the area in the 30s, 40s, and 50s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| that brought black and white residents together to not only play together these games, but be spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| It was quite common for families to come on a Sunday afternoon with a picnic lunch and watch the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| Unfortunately, in that time period in our history, that was a very rare sight in the bad old days of segregation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| Jack Neely, Knoxville historian, praised us about the racial harmony and camaraderie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| My roots run very deep within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| I'm fourth generation, and this feeling of community spirit, this racial harmony and goodwill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| is our gift to Knoxville, the state, and the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| Please don't take that away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| Almost 20 years ago, the MPC, acting on our wishes in their tremendous amount of wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| said the pond property should be made a nature area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Unfortunately, we couldn't get the city to sit down with us to go over how this could come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| Now, think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| Nature area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Pond gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| That's where we get our name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| What a wonderful legacy for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Something we can leave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| This is what the pond should be, and that's what my neighbors agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| We judge societies by how they treat the youngest members, the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| It's a sobering thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| In conclusion, in the Holy Scriptures, our Savior said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| verily, verily, to indicate a statement that was coming that was of important truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| I state to you now, verily, verily, don't take our neighborhood away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| The apartment project, I feel, will do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| I now ask you most humbly, acting on the behalf of my pond gap neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| and friends of pond gap far and wide, reject this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Please reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Next is Stacey Barron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Did I say that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| Barron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| Barron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| You have up to three minutes, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| My name is Stacey Barron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4757)|
| 1:19:26| I live at 617 Hollywood Road in Knoxville and have for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| first as a renter and now as a homeowner, I'm proud to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| I am not David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4776)|

| 1:19:44| When all of this stuff came about, I started talking to my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| I've gone door to door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4789)|

| 1:19:53| I've talked to them via email and a website that I created to see what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| What do you think of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| What are your thoughts about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| In all, I've talked to about 130 of my neighbors in the last month since the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4802)|
| 1:20:10| We have very serious, very valid concerns about this building project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4810)|
| 1:20:18| I'd like to address, before I talk about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| I would really like to address the subject of workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| You all know what that is, right, because you work with it all the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| We didn't know what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| How would we know what that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| We just work every day and come home and do our thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| We didn't have any idea what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| So we asked questions, got a lot of I don't know answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| and the more I don't knows we heard, the more loud our questions became.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| But I want to make it clear that asking questions is not equal to objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4847)|

| 1:21:13| That's us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| We know who we're talking about, and no one knows that life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| and no one knows those struggles better than we do because we live them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| To reframe our objections as being objections to workforce housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| rather than taking them seriously for the objections that they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| for our safety when we pull out of our driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| for small children who are going to walk up a blind hill to go to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4897)|

| 1:21:46| to take all of our objections and make them about workforce housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| instead of safety and security and the, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| to make them about that instead about the suitability of this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| very constrained piece of property is really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4923)|
| 1:22:11| it's really a disservice to those of us who are for the first time speaking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| against something that's happening in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| We have absolutely valid concerns which have not been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| And really the few answers that I've seen via other people's emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| that went to other people rather than to us, the answers I have seen are not satisfying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| 10,000 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4954)|

| 1:22:42| which, by the way, the city owns, and you say, sure, it's all going to be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| I didn't even say what I wanted to say, which was this property is not suitable for this density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4971)|

| 1:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| We had to back to MPC for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Mayor, is it possible to give a little extra time since she hasn't finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| I know we agreed on three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| Could we give another 60 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Do you think, Ms. Barron, do you think you could get it done in 60 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| I'm just really nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Would that be okay, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| I'll make a motion to add 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| There's no second, so it fails for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| Ma'am, please be ready in case there are questions from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| They could call on you if they wish to hear more, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5017)|

| 1:23:46| Ms. Midas, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Amy Midas, 5015 West Summit Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| Thank you for allowing me to address council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| I am speaking this evening on behalf of the Forest Heights Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| We are immediately west of Pond Gap neighborhood and less than a quarter mile from Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| The Forest Heights Neighborhood Association board unanimously voted last night to support Pond Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| in their opposition of the RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| We support the city in their efforts for workforce housing in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| but like Pond Gap neighborhood, we feel the level of density allowed with an RP2 designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| is incompatible with the small one-story World War II-era cottages that line Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| I know the city charter legally binds city council to making zoning decisions based on the conformity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| of the one-year and the west sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| so I want to identify a few issues that we found in assigning an RP2 designation to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| The one-year plan states that medium density residential is for developments primarily residential in character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| from densities 6 to 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| The table on page 10 of the plan, which is included in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| it shows that medium density residential category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| the residential zones permitted are R2, R1A, RP1 at 6 to 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5101)|
| 1:25:09| RP2 is not included as a permitted zone in this MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| It is listed as a high-density residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| and this application for the amendment was denied at MPC last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| Furthermore, the most recent west city sector plan specifically addressed this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| and states on page 21 that the properties along Hollywood Drive, this property, and Garnett Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| are zoned General Commercial and Highway Arterial Commercial C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| However, there is no direct interstate access to these points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| and the areas are surrounded by low-density residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| and it is recommended that these areas be zoned to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| On page 40 of the sector plan, it says that these low-density residential is compatible with RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| at densities of less than 6 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| The hilltop and ridgeside protection plan also agrees with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| at a density of 5.7 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| This property at Garnett, the property at Hollywood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| those were all recommended low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| In Rico, Knoxville, the Garnett one is recommended for RN1, the lowest intense density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| In Rico, Knoxville, for this property, it's recommended RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| I don't understand what the disconnect was with the city sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| and why they listened to the one versus the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| but we feel like just now and in the future, this property needs to be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| It needs to be less than 6 dwelling units or around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| at least more compatible to the hilltop and ridgeside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| I hear MPC staff say all the time that when it comes to rezoning property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Ma'am, you need to conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Anyway, we ask you to decline the application for RP2 for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| Sorry, I know it's hard for everyone to fit in within the three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| but typically we only allow three on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| Okay, next is Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| Is Mary here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| There you are, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| You have up to three minutes, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| I'm here as the president of the Bearden Village Council speaking on behalf of a number of our members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| who, when asked whether they favored RP1 or RP2 for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| everybody who replied, they had a yes or no opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| Everybody who replied to this said yes, RP1, no to RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| Now, what I want to mention is that we are not opposed to having affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| whether it is the type that Stacy described, which is already there in a lot of Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| but also larger buildings that is directed specifically towards affordable workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| We're not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| This site does not seem appropriate for the scale that is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| Forty percent of it is buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| Sixty percent of it is basically goes up to above 40 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| So what we would recommend is that you remand this to the MPC for consideration of RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5324)|
| 1:28:56| Do not approve RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| It's not appropriate, first of all, to zone to a particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| Zoning stays in place even if Elmington Capital cannot make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| So rezoning to an appropriate zone for the future, not just for this project, makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5351)|
| 1:29:20| And actually, I hate to say it, but they probably could do it with RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| But it's really a mistake to try to put a high-density zoning in a small lot that's 5.1 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5367)|
| 1:29:38| and only two acres of that is buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| Okay, and our last speaker is Bob Cronick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Cronick, please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| Bob Cronick, 3636 Tallaloon Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| I'd like to talk about if this is approved and what ought to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| from the perspective of a person who spent ten years in the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| I developed a community school at Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| I haven't heard the school mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| I would like to tell you that the school is a key point of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| You heard the word community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| You heard the word diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| We speak 25 languages in that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| We celebrate diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| So for me, the community and the school is intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| We have troubled communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| We have troubled schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| So one of the first things I think we can do with this is think about prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| Your predecessor used to send officers to eat dinner with my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| Please bring them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| It was a great experience for the officers because it's nothing better than seeing a 6-foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| 3-inch man with a tattoo be intimidated by a 10-year-old child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| But they learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| One of them came with his siren on from Easttown Mall because he didn't want to be late for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| Secondly, I think it's all systemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| All these things are intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| We rank 34th in the nation in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| That's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| We're not opposed to this on that ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Certainly we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| But I would ask that you take the school into consideration and that we look at things systemically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| whether it's law enforcement, medicine, whatever supports that we can offer through that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| Pine Gap has almost become a victim of its own success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| We are a destination community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| People want to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| Everything from wonderful restaurants to diversity to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| And I will tell you this, I've been to this rodeo once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| and that's when my university tore down the marriage student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Because I worked at UT, it was my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5514)|
| 1:32:01| Well, I had to deal with a lot of unhappiness during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| So I would ask if this happens, that you come to Pine Gap School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| We're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| My coordinator, Karen Holtz, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| She'll welcome you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| I always drop it in her lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| And we'll have meetings, discussions, and we'll see that democracy works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| It's a little messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Thank you for the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| Okay, that's the end of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| My name is Mary Elizabeth Yates, and I was on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| Oh, I am so sorry, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| Thank you for telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Again, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| Pull the mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| And you can also lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| I'm Mary Elizabeth Yates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| I reside at 715 Forest View in the Pine Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| I'm at the very top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| And I want to echo everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| Everybody has spoken more eloquently than I'm about to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| But I really don't get this about why it's okay to change what's already working in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5590)|
| 1:33:22| The only thing that I would suggest about this property is that it be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| There are six apartment housing different varieties along Sutherland Avenue in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5609)|
| 1:33:38| There is not a park within any capability of getting there by foot or bike or scooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5618)|
| 1:33:50| There is nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| There is nothing for the children in the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| There is no place to go sit and listen to the birds, the hilltop, where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| We have the wood thrush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| And if anybody knows about wood thrushes, they're usually in very dense, woodsy areas way out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| not right beside Interstate 40, above this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| It's a beautiful space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| And to add housing to it, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| We need more of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| I'm not opposing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| But there is a much better use of this property for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| The whole area around here than to put families in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| And nobody has spoken to the pollution that comes off Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| I live at the top of Interstate 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| And I am grateful for every green leaf that is between me and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| And any, any of the foliage that will be taken away is going to be a disservice to this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5692)|
| 1:35:05| because every green leaf helps with the pollution that comes off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| And the noise of the interstate, I'm protected from it a little bit, but I hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| I just pretend it's water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I think about all the people coming up and down the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Some are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| Some are sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| It's just humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| But we do not need to take that special space away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5723)|
| 1:35:30| Add more concrete, more drainage problems, more noise, more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| just for a select group of whoever lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5736)|
| 1:35:45| And I thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| Some of your faces are very familiar to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| I would like to report that the neighbors upon Gap, Sutherland Heights, Historic Sutherland Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| voted to support RP1 for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Again, I apologize for missing your name on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| I spoke up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| I'm glad you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| I've heard from a lot of my constituents about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| and I know this has been a process that's been going on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| And I share a lot of the same concerns that you had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| and I think we'll hopefully address those and some questions that we can get answers to this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5791)|
| 1:36:42| I think to start off, maybe Director Wade, do you think you could come up and just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| I know one thing I was particularly proud of that was talked about in the against portion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5807)|
| 1:36:54| it seemed pretty much universal that opposition here is not about affordable housing or about workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| And that's been the case that I've heard from folks when I've spoken with them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| So I feel really good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| But maybe you could address a little bit about what the situation on the ground actually looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| with regard to affordability in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Yeah, I'm here in favor of the rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| because this will enable the development of very much needed quality rental housing that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5849)|
| 1:37:38| We feel like this developer is a quality developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| We've worked with them for a number of years on another project that's underway right now, Southside Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| And when they approached us in May of this year about potential funding for the two developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5869)|
| 1:37:58| the one south at Young High Pike and Hollywood Drive, which they're combining together on the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5878)|
| 1:38:07| That's kind of an important issue that when they're going for their tax credit financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| they want to do both projects together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| So they approached us with an application for funding, which we hope to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| And we will be filling a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| The reason we wanted to support this is because we feel this is a great location for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5906)|
| 1:38:34| This is vacant, unused land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| It's privately owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| I know there were some comments about this should be a park and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| Well, someone owns this and somebody desires to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| It's currently Zone C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| So, you know, turning that into housing is an ideal use for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| It's close to amenities, shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| It's close to jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| It's close to public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| It's near a quality community school that currently has over 200 spaces for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| Their ideal capacity is 534 students, and they're currently at 316.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5953)|
| 1:39:24| I'm speaking about Pond Gap Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| Also, we looked at the data for this region, for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5968)|
| 1:39:36| Within the 37919 zip code, there's 6,035 renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| Of those, 43% are currently cost burdened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| which means that they are paying more than 30% of their income for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| Additionally, there's another 190 households that are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| So there's need even within this community for quality, affordable rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=5997)|
| 1:40:05| This has been mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| but in 2011, UT demolished 780 units of affordable housing on Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6007)|
| 1:40:16| More recently, the former Prestwick Ridge Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| they're now called Mountain Brook, they converted to market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| and that was a loss of another 136 affordable units in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| Our intention is to support this development with affordable rental development funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6031)|
| 1:40:39| It's to meet one of our high priority needs in the community development department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| and a policy priority for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| Thank you, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| Mr. Frost, if I could ask you, what, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| Mr. Seymour said that we're dealing with a simple rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| I want to make sure that everyone knows what exactly we're voting on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| so if you could address that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Well, what before you is to rezone the property from a C4 use to a planned residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| Planned residential use is a little bit different from your traditional residential use like R1, R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| because there's the planned element with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| It's meant to be more structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| There's some guidelines that apply to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| So that's the determination that's being made with this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Ms. Brooks is joining us from MPC, and so I have some questions for you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6108)|
| 1:41:57| Where are we in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| You know, is this the very beginning of a process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Is this the middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Is it the end of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Where are we in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Amy Brooks, representing the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| The rezoning is the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| As Mr. Frost just said, the next step, if this is to be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| they will be required to submit a development plan to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| and at that time the next set of review will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| Okay, and that next set of review is the use-on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| The use-on review, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Is it possible for counsel tonight to give some direction to MPC about concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| that have been voiced by the neighborhood and folks in the community about various issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| to make sure that those are reviewed and addressed in the use-on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| Sure, we'd be happy to take additional thoughts on things that need to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| as part of the development review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| But those would be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| If we make those comments, those would be addressed in the use-on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| Depending on the specifics of the request, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| And this may be for you, and it may be for Mr. Hagerman, or Director Hagerman, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6189)|
| 1:43:21| There was some initial very general look at traffic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| and of course we're going to get much more specific saying this passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| and there's a traffic study that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| but were there any indications about the impact of traffic with this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6215)|
| 1:43:45| There were some quick rule of thumb looks at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| just sort of give you a general scope of the impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| 2016 count data for Hollywood Road is 8,648, which is moderate for a two-lane road like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6239)|
| 1:44:09| It is not particularly congested until it gets up in 15,000, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6249)|
| 1:44:19| This project, of course that depends on some of the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| The intersections will be the critical factor in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| and schools are generators of delay and congestion just because of their nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6266)|
| 1:44:35| So down at the end of this section of street, there's an impact to the way the traffic flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| It has nothing to do with the amount of population here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| But count data for Hollywood Road is 8,648.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| This project would generate roughly 790 trips per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| and of course that's distributed out through the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| So that's what, 8%, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| It's not zero, but it's not huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Is Hollywood considered at capacity as a road at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| I have not heard any complaints about congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| I'm sure that there is some delays at peak times at the signals at the two ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| I have not heard any concerns except right around the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| That's the only thing that I've heard much about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| And then, Ms. Brooks, if this was to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6346)|
| 1:45:55| and council was to give some guidance to MPC on things they wanted to have addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| there is an avenue for this to come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| If it's, if the, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| So once the, I mean there is an avenue, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| so if the commission approves the use on review, it can be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| And that would be the avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| And that appeal would come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| And if council was not satisfied with some of the conditions that we might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| or not conditions, if council wasn't satisfied with some of the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| that we wanted to make sure we're paid attention to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| council could vote it down at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| I think I definitely want to let other council members speak too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| But I appreciate everyone, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| And I want to also thank the members of the public who came this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| It's not easy sometimes to stand up and talk about things in a forum like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| And I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| And for some of you, I know it was the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| But this is ultimately your city council, so we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6436)|
| 1:47:17| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| I just need to, I'm not sure who to address this to for a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| One of the ladies who spoke and actually sent us an e-mail with pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| brought to our attention the retaining wall that had some significant damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| Now with that, does that factor into the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| or is this something separate that the city, we would just need to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| I would, I won't speak to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| As far as I know, it doesn't really factor into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| It is almost always a private property issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6471)|
| 1:47:59| The retaining walls are nearly always at the edge of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6479)|
| 1:48:06| or on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| There are very few throughout the city that are on right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| that are city responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| So I know one in particular that we've gotten complaints about on Hollywood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| We went out and made sure that it was not on right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| They have been put on notice that it is theirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| and they're responsible for fixing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6513)|
| 1:48:36| But that is left at the discretion of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| as to whether or not they would repair that or replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Since it's off right-of-way, I'm not sure about the details there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| Certainly, since they're on notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| and they're clear about liability if it did fall down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| but the codes and zoning folks would be the ones to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| if there was enforcement to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Other parts of town where there's walls that fall down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| and don't cause other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| the limit of what we do is clean the pieces off of right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| If I can comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| Ma'am, wait until a council member would have to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| Just hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I will call on you, ma'am, to just add a point of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| regarding this particular retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| Add a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| If this is not on the city's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| then why has the city come and done repairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| I've lived here 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| At least twice I've seen city out there doing repairs on this wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| You can see a picture of one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| What we will do is, because all council members received your email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| we'll actually forward that and get more clarification as it relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| You're welcome, and thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| I've lost my train of thought here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| Well, one of the things in looking at this that came up to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| was that this property got zoned C-4 in 1987, and it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| I had someone pull that report today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| It was recommended by MPC for C-6, and it went C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| There was no neighborhood opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| and it was for someone who wanted to put many storage units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| And I don't think that that's something that would benefit the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| and I would hate to see that or something similar come along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| and tear out the entire hillside and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| So I'm glad that it is as it is at this moment to have this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| I wanted a couple of things to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| There's a billboard there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Is that billboard in the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| or is on the property that you are, I'm assuming, contingent to purchase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| What's the story with the billboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| Whose is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| The billboard is on the property that we have under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| The rights to retain the billboard would stay with the current property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| So the billboard would stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| We wouldn't have any ability to take it down or remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| And then to clarify, this may be a question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| So there's a little bit of discussion coming at council members today about RP1 versus RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| The request for this particular rezoning was for RP2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| but then it was passed with the condition of 24 units per acre, which is RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6704)|
| 1:51:54| What differences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| There's no height differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| There's no – I can't seem to find any differentiation between RP1 and RP2 outside of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6717)|
| 1:52:05| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| So RP1 is up to 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| RP2 is up to 40 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| And RP3 is up to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| So that's the differentiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| So I guess maybe you could answer or Mr. Seymour, why would we do –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| what's to gain or why are we in the position and why would folks ask us for RP2 versus RP –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6741)|
| 1:52:27| why have we got an RP2 with a condition that in essence makes it an RP1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| I can't quite figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| The original request for the rezoning that the commission received was up to 30 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| So it would have fallen into the RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| Could it not have been changed to RP1 at the MPC meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| It could have been, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| So instead they just conditioned it and in essence made it an RP1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| It's an RP2 with a condition for 24 units per acre, which is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6774)|
| 1:53:03| One way half does and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I'm just trying to make sure because there was some communication to us that there was a height difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| and I can't find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| I've had our attorney, Frost, look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| There's nothing – there's no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| So I have a follow-up question to that and then I just have some comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| So this is a question for John Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| Just based on that question, would there be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| would you have any objection to a rezoning to RP1 versus RP2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| if RP1 accommodates the density that you've already agreed to under the conditions approved by MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6822)|
| 1:53:52| Yeah, I don't want to get out of my lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| I mean, you know, I refer to the MPC folks on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6834)|
| 1:53:58| what other kind of changes come along with making that kind of a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| I mean, I will say that we obviously – it's in our interest to ask for the lowest density –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| lowest intensity zoning that would accomplish our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| And so if – we're not asking for RP2 just sort of frivolously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6854)|
| 1:54:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| So if there would be no substantive change to what we could do as far as height or setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6865)|
| 1:54:34| or lot coverage, surface area, I'm just – I'm hesitant because there are so many sort of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6874)|
| 1:54:43| provisions that go along with that that I would hate to say stand up here right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| before having looked at it, agree to that, and then realize, oh, that's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| You know, now we're sort of a month behind where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| So that's sort of my initial reaction to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| We're here on first reading tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| and we're asking for approval based upon the MPC recommendation, which was for RP2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| Between now and two weeks from now, if we can look at it and RP1 takes care of our issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| we'll communicate back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| And I assume on second reading you could – Charlie, you can bring it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| Yeah, you could change it on second reading, and you could bring it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| But that would be a substantive change, so they'd need to pass it on emergency for that to be the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6932)|
| 1:55:41| I just think that with the – I mean, the zoning follows the property and not the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| so that would be something that could be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| And I also have some comments, but I think –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Well, I'll ask my question out loud if you want me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| Well, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| You had your light on, and then it went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| Can we just clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| We had a past zoning issue several months back where –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| Oh, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Where there was a C4 that came to us, and we thought C3 –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| there were enough of us here that wanted to say C3 was better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| I may be remembering incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| But nonetheless, we were told we couldn't down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| It had to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| And we sent it back to MPC with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Am I remembering incorrectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| It would depend on whether or not the issue had been considered at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| If you were sending something –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| if you were coming forward with something that hadn't been considered at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| then it would need to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| But it's very clear in the record of this case that MPC considered a planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7004)|
| 1:56:52| at 24 units – 24 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| That means they considered that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| And so it wouldn't have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| It would go back to first reading because it's a substantive change going from R2 to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| But it wouldn't have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7034)|
| 1:57:15| I just have a few comments because there certainly has been some very good dialogue, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| about this very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| This is just a really challenging issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| And I know that those of you who have served on council for six-plus years now have faced this issue many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| I would say that we're going to be facing this more and not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| Developable – developable, if that's the right word – and available land in city limits is very sparse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7057)|
| 1:57:45| There's not a lot of it available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| And so pressure to increase housing density is actually only going to continue to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7069)|
| 1:57:56| as we try to figure out how to accommodate a growing population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| When you add to this the increased cost of construction materials and labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| residential developers are in a bind, whether they're trying to develop affordable housing or just develop housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7087)|
| 1:58:16| Because of those costs, it's a financial gain of figuring out how do we build to make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7096)|
| 1:58:24| with adequate number of units and beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| And then you add to this that there's a national trend that is sort of out of Knoxville's purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| that is really creating a growing low-income population in communities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| So I know I've received correspondence from many community-minded people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| who I know are not opposed to workforce housing, people who are the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| I really enjoyed those statements earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| I haven't heard that there's opposition to workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| It's just a change, and it's a change that's going to continue to affect our city and our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7141)|
| 1:59:08| There are concerns about density, traffic volume, neighborhood character, and those are real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| However, we need to grapple with this as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| If we value affordability, where will that housing be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| Where are we going to put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| There's not a whole lot of land left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| Do we want to concentrate that only in certain parts of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| which sort of leads to additional segregation by income, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| Do we want to put it in areas where there aren't amenities and there's not infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7179)|
| 1:59:46| I think these are challenges that we're going to have to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| Just thinking about South Knoxville and Fort Sanders, the areas I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7191)|
| 1:59:58| what I would consider traditional workforce housing, very much like the housing stock in Pond Gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7198)|
| 2:00:05| that housing is selling now for more than double the price it was five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| It's no longer within reach of people who are sort of in that workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7212)|
| 2:00:19| So I'm concerned that Knoxville's low-density, detached home residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| will become affordable only to people who are in the upper income brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| And so the things that we value about these neighborhoods, their diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| could potentially go away if we don't sort of get on the front end of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| that there is affordability within those neighborhoods where the land exists to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| So I just wanted to make some of those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| Oh, is this thing working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| I just wanted to make a comment for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| It does feel, and I understand where folks are coming from when they say this is a very small parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| to do this kind of development, but what I don't want to encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| which has happened in my area and my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| is tearing down smaller houses and cobbling those parcels together to make large parcels to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7277)|
| 2:01:25| Because, as Councilwoman Welch just said, we have a limited number of parcels and land to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| and yet we are in this position where we lost 780 units here and 800 units there for different, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| places that accepted vouchers, on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| And so we need to be really cognizant as we move forward, as we zone things, as we discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| that we recognize that that happens in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| It's happened in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| We had a demo permit just issued the other day to complete a two-block area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| or a full block area almost in my area where I guarantee you down the future is going to be a high rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7319)|
| 2:02:08| and a high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| And what we lost were our shotgun houses that were our workforce housing for the mill that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| So I want to see more efforts to protect those houses and keep them residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| And to do that, you know, I have to acknowledge that this is a place that we've got to be able to put some density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7340)|
| 2:02:28| where we can so we don't lose those other houses at the same time down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| Mr. Shepard, I know you and I had a chance to talk just before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| but would you be open to a public meeting when your paperwork is turned in to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7362)|
| 2:02:49| so that the neighborhood and the community involved can see the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| and be able to review it prior to the MPC meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| I have listened to a lot of the concerns from the neighborhood, from the community around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7382)|
| 2:03:10| I walked with Ms. Varon in the rain and reviewed the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| and I think this is an important issue with having affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| and it's obviously a difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| It comes with challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| But ultimately, I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| I want to make sure that all the concerns that were addressed by the community are going to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| so I'm going to direct that to MPC here in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| Let's give this a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| It's at the very beginning of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| Let's see what comes of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| Let's see what the site plan looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| and make sure that it's consistent with the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| I think the very legitimate concerns that the neighborhood has made here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| So I'll come back to you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| The concerns that I heard that I'd like to be considered by MPC if this motion is to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| would be to consider the impact on traffic and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| Safety was mentioned multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| I think what we were talking about was traffic safety there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Consideration of site distance as would be impacted by the hills in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7457)|
| 2:04:26| which may make it difficult to see traffic as it's coming and going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| which would also be in effect to traffic and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| Consider a deceleration lane and a turn lane to improve traffic and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7474)|
| 2:04:40| and to consider that the development is suitable and compatible with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7480)|
| 2:04:47| And with that, I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| I've appreciated the comments and appreciate Mr. Roberto's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| I plan on supporting it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| You know, it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| Listen to the concerns of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| I really respect the passion and interest and care of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| And so I thank everybody for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| I think sort of where we're coming back to where we started, we're looking at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| rezoning a parcel from C-4 to essentially what it looks like as RP-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7519)|
| 2:05:26| I know it's RP-2 is what we're voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| But I think that's a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| You know, C-4, there's a lot of things that I think that could be developed on this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| that would really detract from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| And I think the opportunity we have now for the neighborhood and for council is to work with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| that's working with the city on a number of projects to really make it something that will be an enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| through the use on review process, an enhancement to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| and address some of the issues that have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| So I just wanted to say my thoughts for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7570)|

| 2:07:42| Sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| There's lots of rezoning happening in my district right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| so I support this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| I just wanted to see if anyone from JMS Investment is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| Are you Mr. Sude's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| Is that the correct pronunciation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| Sude's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7675)|
| 2:07:56| Close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7676)|
| 2:07:57| I've heard it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7677)|
| 2:07:58| I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| I didn't mean to get that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| We had an opportunity to speak yesterday, so I appreciate you being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| I appreciate the phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| certainly down zoning from industrial to residential is completely a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| I know that you and I talked briefly about just the amount of student housing that's kind of coming on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7701)|
| 2:08:22| And obviously you all know much more about how to do the market analysis on that than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| I'm just curious if you had any thoughts about, you know, if for some reason, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| I know the neighborhood is very interested in sort of increasing the diversity of residents, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7713)|
| 2:08:40| and sort of bringing in more adults and people who are in the workforce, not to exclude students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| but just to increase that diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| Did you have any thoughts about sort of how to market if for some reason this housing didn't fill with students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| And just want to let you know, too, when you asked the other day kind of what our thoughts were for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| student housing is the initial thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| We're two blocks away from the hospital as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| We believe we'll be able to accommodate anybody in the medical field, travel nurses, doctors, anybody else in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7747)|
| 2:09:15| Google Maps has it at about a three-minute walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| So we feel like we're pretty well positioned to really welcome anybody in the community to house in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7758)|
| 2:09:25| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7765)|
| 2:09:26| Thank you so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| And I appreciate that because I really do think that this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| people are not necessarily always seeing it for what it could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| which is a very walkable, centralized neighborhood that is accessible to a lot of amenities and a lot of workplaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7775)|
| 2:09:42| So thanks for putting some thought into that, and thank you again for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| Happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7792)|

| 2:09:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| 12L is an ordinance to rezone property located on the south side of Grand Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| east side of 19th Street, from I-2 District to R-2 District, subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| Sean Suttis, applicant, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7814)|

| 2:10:17| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| 12M is an ordinance to rezone property located on the north side of Cherokee Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| north of Eddington Road, from R-1 District to R-P-1 District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| at a density of up to 5.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| Land Development Solutions, applicant, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Mayor, I believe that there are some people who are here to speak on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| and I'm wondering if we could hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| First, we have Kathy Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7845)|
| 2:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| Kathy Scott, 4233 Wells Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| Eddington Road has flooded eight times between June 28th and August 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| to a point where cars could not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| This did not happen before these complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| these many complexes were built on Cherokee Trail and Eddington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| It has slowly been getting worse for the past 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| as more and more developments have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| The creek floodwater drains into a creek on Eddington Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| which is a tributary of Goose Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| It is already mandated that the dirt going into Goose Creek needs to be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| under the total maximum daily load for siltation and habitat alteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| in the Tennessee River watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Goose Creek is also already coated with polychlorinated biphenyls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| Impermeable asphalt runoff will also add polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| These are compounds that do not break down easily in the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| so they have to be physically dredged to be removed from the waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| Because they are carcinogens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Another development in this area will only add to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| In the near future, water may be a huge asset to East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| For this reason, I have submitted a complaint to TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| When the road floods, cars are forced onto narrowback roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| that are not suited for through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| Cherokee Trail is already closed on many days for the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| due to electric utility work to serve these developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| which makes it very difficult for people to get to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| especially the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| What will happen to traffic when they do significant repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| on the crumbling sewer system on South Knoxville's busy streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| including Cherokee Trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| Except for the repair done when raw sewage started to leak into Mary Vestal Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| there have been only spot fixes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| Is it wise to add more complexes in the area before utility repairs are finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7980)|
| 2:13:07| Especially since these developments cause the water tower to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| which ruins the view south for many residents of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| I think the developers should at least be asked to make the changes needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=7996)|
| 2:13:21| for the sewer upgrades before they build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| This out-of-state real estate investor does not care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| They got this land cheap, and they know they can roll over the system here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| They circumvented the hillside and ridgetop guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| by getting a permit to use the land as a dump site for fill dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| from their property down the street called Knox Ridge Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| Now that they have changed the slope enough to suit the engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| they want to build on unstable fill in an area where there is already a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| with too much dirt going into our waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| I put it to you that these engineers who approved this plan have already made mistakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| in calculating the amount of runoff and placement of the ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| This company's other development, Knox Ridge, is made of man-made cliffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8050)|
| 2:14:19| tight housing units, large swaths of pavement, and little vegetation to absorb the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| Given this and the possible instability of the dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| I think it's zoning to remain what it is, R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| Every time this company builds a complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| they form a new limited liability corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| They are after short-term gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| These apartments are very expensive, much higher than the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8083)|
| 2:14:52| I'm going to have to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| And they do not care what happens to our area in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| The puppet masters who are doing these developments are untouchable from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| We have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| In the words of another famous real estate developer, I've never gone bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| Once this is approved, the complex that goes up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| is almost nothing that could be done for violation, pollution, or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| If major settling causes a mudslide or something similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| who will be responsible for the cleanup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| The city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| The builders should at least have to pay for the soil to be tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| and compacted before building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| If you have driven on Cherokee Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| I hope you can imagine coming around a bly curve and seeing a pedestrian in the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| because there is no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8141)|
| 2:15:47| If there is a car in the other lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| you have to slam on your brakes to avoid a fatality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| and hope the person behind you is paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| Ma'am, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| We also have Mr. Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8162)|
| 2:16:09| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria Avenue, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8173)|
| 2:16:19| Just to finish up on her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| because of the total development situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| at the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| I think the council should consider somehow enacting at least a 90-day moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| to allow testing of the soil that has been brought in for this apartment or complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8195)|
| 2:16:45| The one thing that is visible to the eye, the runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| every time it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| if you see something that you've got a lake literally on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| you cannot pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| That's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| And it needs to be addressed immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| And one of the problems is in Goose Creek, Baker Creek, Williams Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8225)|
| 2:17:14| we've had this problem with pollution before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| And we don't need to go through it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| So if you would, I would want you to consider at least a 90-day moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| get an independent testing group in to deal with and get those results in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8247)|
| 2:17:34| and have that come before MPC and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| And if the results don't come back favorable, kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| Another thing I want to address also, which I originally wanted to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| October 16th, Tuesday, 830 in the morning at the CAC Annex on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8270)|
| 2:17:58| you have scheduled a recode informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| Sir, Mr. Roach, if you want to talk on something different from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8282)|
| 2:18:07| you'll need to come back at public forum to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| This is a separate issue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| We'll add your name to public forum if you want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| So we're still on this item, which is 12M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| Those were the only speakers that I had, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| Did I miss anybody who wanted to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8311)|
| 2:18:32| I was late to the meeting and wasn't able to get my name on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| My name is Rusty Bax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| I'm representing the owner, the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Please state your address as well, and I'll set the timer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| We have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| It's Rusty Bax with Land Development Solutions, 310 Simmons Road, Suite K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| A couple items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| This project does not drain at all toward Eddington Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8338)|
| 2:19:07| It drains totally to the back of the property toward Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8347)|
| 2:19:14| Please refrain, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| I'm shaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| But we appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| NBC took a look at this project and recommended approval based on the vote of 12-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8359)|
| 2:19:29| We think it's a smart project to go to the RP zone because it gives NBC a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| an opportunity to review the plan after we get the opportunity to survey the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8375)|
| 2:19:42| and appropriately design the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8382)|
| 2:19:52| We've submitted it under the RP, the low-density residential zone, which is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8392)|
| 2:19:59| There is an opportunity to ask for a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| which many of the properties on the other side of Cherokee Trail have a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| and we've chose to keep it the lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| It should have minimal impact on traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| And, again, the drainage, we would take care of any of the detention that would need to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8413)|
| 2:20:21| and water quality that the city requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| In addition to that, the fill that was placed on the property was tested as it was put into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8424)|
| 2:20:32| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8438)|
| 2:20:39| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8439)|
| 2:20:40| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| I have done a lot of background on this, and thank you, Mr. Baska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| I was able to speak with him earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| I've spoken with some neighborhood representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| I actually do have one question for Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| Can you tell me, Amy, does this proposal meet the guidelines of the hillside and ridgetop protection plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8457)|
| 2:21:08| The analysis that was completed for this project resulted in a maximum density guideline of 2.65 based on the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8468)|
| 2:21:25| So the proposed density as requested by the applicant is 5.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| So, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| The recommended density is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| Mr. Baska, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8502)|
| 2:21:44| The staff also did recommend the 5.9 units per acre for the project due to the other developments that have occurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8504)|
| 2:21:54| That would create 22 lots on this small track of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| I've talked with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| We think that he has a need to be able to build a certain number of units to make this project make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8524)|
| 2:22:13| We thought that we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| We thought that maybe we could reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| We don't think we can get the 22 units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| We might be able to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| We think we can get 16 units in there, and that would be 4.9 units per acre, and they could live with that, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8542)|
| 2:22:31| That would be a reduction in the total development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| If it's okay, I'd like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| I'm ready to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| So, I've reviewed the record closely on this and spoken with staff at MPC, looked into the criteria in the hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8564)|
| 2:22:57| certainly driven those roads for years and spent considerable time over the past couple of weeks just checking out the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| and the neighborhoods around the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| So, this is a little bit different, it seems to me, from some of the other information sheets and packets we get from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8587)|
| 2:23:17| The concerns about this site were pretty strong, and I share them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8597)|
| 2:23:23| I have some concerns from MPC and citizens regarding the roads and infrastructure around the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8603)|
| 2:23:32| I have some concerns about traffic safety, and I think the density would adversely affect traffic safety beyond an acceptable range in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8612)|
| 2:23:45| I also don't believe that there should be a departure from the density recommended in the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8625)|
| 2:23:53| I believe this proposal is not compatible with the neighborhood and surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| and that it will adversely impact the neighborhoods and the surrounding area as well as the roads and traffic safety of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8638)|
| 2:24:07| and I'm therefore making a motion to deny this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8647)|
| 2:24:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| I guess my question is for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| So, the MPC recommended to approve it at 5.9, but the hillside and ridgetop would only allow for, what was it, 2 point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8661)|
| 2:24:32| So, I guess my question is, why is the MPC recommending something that's against the hillside and ridgetop plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8672)|
| 2:24:41| The staff, you know, provided the analysis and did acknowledge that with strict application of the density that the guidelines would recommend 2.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8681)|
| 2:24:55| There was some consideration taken to the existing slope characteristics, the looking at adjacent sites and what had been approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8695)|
| 2:25:09| Sorry, is that me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| You know, the recommendation was that it was consistent with adopted plans for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8713)|
| 2:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| So, I guess the hillside and ridgetop plan is sort of just, I guess, what's been referred to as a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8723)|
| 2:25:31| It's not something that MPC staff has to follow in terms of making recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8731)|
| 2:25:37| It is a guide that we do look at as a key piece of information to inform recommendations that are made by staff and presented to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8737)|
| 2:25:45| One of the other considerations for the site is the clearing and grading that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| And so, I believe that's another element that was taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| And with the stipulation that no other, that they would, you know, continue to take a look at the steep slopes and protect what's, you know, remaining there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8755)|
| 2:26:08| And continue to staff with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| I'm sure some of the concerns as Council Member Welch raises well, so I'll be supporting the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8772)|
| 2:26:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| So, back to the same discussion we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| We're here to change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| They're going to come back to you with the site plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| So, that part's still on use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| I can't hardly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| I don't think that 20 units is going to dramatically change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| I don't know how we could get into the number of traffic that that creates and what the traffic is there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8811)|
| 2:26:59| And look, is that a percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| But I'm not guessing that 20 units is going to impact the traffic at a percentage that wouldn't be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8821)|
| 2:27:10| I mean, I think you have zoning all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| It's in a, where property on both sides of it and across the street is zoned for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| This is what kind of set the precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| I can't really see valid in denying it where, you know, when you've got it all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8842)|
| 2:27:31| So, I think it's, I don't know how you say enough's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| And when property around it has already zoned it and it's already built and started being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8855)|
| 2:27:43| So, I can't, I'm going to vote for it and see it go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| Let him come back to MPC with his site plan just like in the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8868)|
| 2:27:55| And, you know, can continue to modify it if changes need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| So, I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8879)|
| 2:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| Councilwoman Welch, would you like to call on Ms. Scott again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| Yes, Ms. Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| This has been a mistake since the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| They have put students on an island where there are no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| There is no cat bus access and there never will be because the road is too windy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| And there is no safe way to walk or bike on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| And who in their right mind would they think that's a good idea for student housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8905)|
| 2:28:31| The problem is, is that people walk on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| It's not the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| People walk on this road and it makes it very dangerous because of the blind curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8923)|
| 2:28:44| But I think, you know, 20 units is not going to impact it in a degree that makes it significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8924)|
| 2:28:52| Those are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| They're already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| The traffic, the people, the people walking on the road, the lack of that is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| It's pre-existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8939)|
| 2:29:00| We have a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| Councilwoman Ryder, are you going to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| I just want to say I'm voting with Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| I'm not looking for applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| I spent a lot of time going over there and getting backed up at that interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I wasn't on this council, as some of us weren't, when a lot of these things were approved and developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8955)|
| 2:29:22| My husband goes over to work there every day, and every time I go to an appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| it's nearly a rear-end collision trying to get off and get there, in addition to all the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| Of course, I'm a little biased towards a lot of the UT development that's going there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| but I'll tell a quick story when we talk about the bus thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| I actually had a babysitter for my kids that lived over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| and she had a minor fender bender right after she moved over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8981)|
| 2:29:47| And she couldn't get anywhere because you're landlocked over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| You can't walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| I guess you can get an Uber, but you can't get a bus out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| And I don't quite understand when we're driving for a more walkable community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| where we're stockpiling students over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| and the ridge and hillside development over there with some of those retaining walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9002)|
| 2:30:08| just is unattractive in the least, and I don't quite understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| I guess I do have a question for engineering that's maybe not pertaining to this exact rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9013)|
| 2:30:19| but when we have discussions about zoning and we put confidence in stormwater plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9019)|
| 2:30:27| that are going to come as part of the concept plan and the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| and I don't know because I haven't verified it with my own eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| but when folks are saying that we have flooding over there that we didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| before a lot of these developments went in, I want to have some confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9038)|
| 2:30:43| and I've asked Vice Mayor Saunders in the future if we could have either a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9043)|
| 2:30:49| or one of our dinners be about stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| That comes at us constantly, and I don't feel that I'm an expert on stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9051)|
| 2:30:56| but I need to have some confidence that it's dealt with in a valid manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9056)|
| 2:31:02| and I just don't see how that is happening everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| So I don't know if I put that in the form of a question, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| Well, we would be happy to provide whatever information you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| whatever workshop or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| We'd certainly be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| If you're asking about this particular area...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| This particular area in a general whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| if past stormwater plans haven't dealt with the stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| then how do we have the confidence to allow more development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| when it's kind of past the tipping point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Part of the complicating factor up there is that a lot of it was developed in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9097)|
| 2:31:42| that has somewhat less stringent standards than the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| Much of it's still in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| There was at least one development up there that was developed in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| and then got annexed after it was done or close to done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9115)|
| 2:32:01| So there's various layers of complexity in that stormwater question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| but we certainly do strive to meet the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9126)|
| 2:32:13| and if you talk to a developer, they'll say that we're really mean about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9133)|
| 2:32:20| I do know that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| I've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9143)|
| 2:32:26| So if it seems that because something was done to one standard but then annexed later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9146)|
| 2:32:32| is there an opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| At what point do we reassess and say, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| What was implemented with that plan didn't work, and how are we going to go about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9157)|
| 2:32:43| I mean, obviously we had that issue, I guess, at Prosser Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| where we had a major project there to deal with flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| So is that something that gets triggered and happens in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| when an area gets developed inadequately with stormwater plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| Yeah, a lot of that was mostly our property and or roadway flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9173)|
| 2:32:59| so that became our project to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| A situation like, well, Eddington Road where it floods is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| so it's not our project to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| We'd be happy to work with the county on whatever it is that can be done about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| but much of the drainage area to that section of road is also in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| Okay, so it's not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9203)|
| 2:33:24| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| So we have a motion and a second to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9212)|
| 2:33:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Which of the noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| The denial passed as seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9219)|
| 2:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9226)|
| 2:33:47| Council, we are now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| We have been sitting here for over two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| I need to call a very short break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| and then we'll come back as we have about 20 minutes of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| I apologize to those who have been waiting, but maybe you've got a chance to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9240)|
| 2:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9270)|
| 2:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9300)|
| 2:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9330)|
| 2:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9360)|
| 2:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180815?start=9390)|
