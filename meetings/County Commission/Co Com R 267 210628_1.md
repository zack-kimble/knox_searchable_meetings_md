| 2:15:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| Mr. Andrews, if you would join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| I'll give you just a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| I want to make sure I understand this, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| Currently, a recovery house is not allowed in any zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| that is applicable to the town center district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| It's not allowed in the EC03, the Carter Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| And you haven't been able to check to see if there's any OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| in any of the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| As far as it being two separate properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| could they not just simply go back and re-parcel it to one track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8183)|
| 2:16:31| I mean, yes, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| You mean go through the platting process and one lot it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| Would it then count as two facilities or one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| If they were to try to open up a separate facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| they'd have to come back through the use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| If this was to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| they'd have to come back through the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| And their use-on-review for the first facility was granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8209)|
| 2:16:53| conditioned upon this sector plan change allowing OB, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| The request is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| There's very specific conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| I'm happy to read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| So the recovery housing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| which includes both the subject property at 8535 Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| and the adjacent property at 8537 Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| shall not have more than 40 clients that reside or are treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| The use-on-review approval for these two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| shall be considered as one and not split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| into two separate recovery facilities with different operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| And there's some other conditions associated with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| So they're conditioned at a maximum of 40 for both parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8249)|
| 2:17:34| 40 for both, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| Is that each parcel or a total of 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| Total clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| The 40 clients that reside are treated at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| 8535 and 8537?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| So they couldn't put another 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Even if this were to proceed, it would be maximized at 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| No, they'd have to come back through the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| So they could if it was granted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| I think there's some other probably building restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8276)|
| 2:17:59| associated with the number of clients to be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| It might kick it into a different category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| outside of recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8287)|
| 2:18:08| I'd have to consult with Knox County Codes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| What's the total size of both tracts together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8292)|
| 2:18:18| 8535 is 1.78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| I'd have to look up the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| It's roughly a similar size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| Roughly slightly over a three-acre tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| Three and a half acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| It might be a little bit smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| Thank you. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| I've got more lights on, but I'm going to just take a quick minute to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| Mr. Anders, if you'll give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8322)|
| 2:18:45| just take a few minutes to give us your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| My name is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| I live at 8501 North Ruggles Ferry Pike, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| And I'd be glad to reserve my time for the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Yeah, I mean, it's up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| of whether or not you want to address this or that or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| Just a point, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| If this item fails, the next item is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| I think your commissioner is encouraging you to speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| I'm here today in opposition to this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| for the next item, actually, rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| And while the homeowners in our community recognize the need for such facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| we feel that this location is not fit for this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| nor for the residents they will serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| The location is in close proximity to Carter Elementary, Carter Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| Carter High School, and many of our community feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| that alone is not in the best interest of our students that attend those schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| and we request that this request be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| And also, one thing that hasn't been discussed, along with the other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| is public transportation is not available to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| And there's also some wording in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| that public transportation for recovery houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| should be within that same 1,320 feet, one quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| And there are only just a very limited number of eating establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| within walking distance of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| And the current location for this recovery center is ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8423)|
| 2:20:31| They're on Loves Creek Road, certainly within the 1,320 feet of Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8431)|
| 2:20:37| where it has public transportation, many restaurants in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8437)|
| 2:20:42| job opportunities with Loves and the coming distribution center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| And those opportunities, the residents could certainly take advantage of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| I'd also like to note that this is not a mandatory attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8452)|
| 2:20:59| These residents can go and come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| There's no restrictions on them to go and come as they please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| It's my understanding that they can't make them stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| So we recognize the need for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| and I'm sure that this operator does a good job at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8478)|
| 2:21:26| We just feel that this is not the proper location for this recovery center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| and we're in the midst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| We're a newly formed Ruggles Ferry Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| and we're dead set on making our community what it used to be several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8495)|
| 2:21:41| when we had a Hellman's and a Cardin's and some of the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| It was a destination place, and we are working hard to bring it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| and we would appreciate your consideration and denial of this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| I'm going to go back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| I was just wondering how many community meetings were there to discuss this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8521)|
| 2:22:11| I'm sorry, I missed your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8531)|
| 2:22:12| How many community meetings did you all have with the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| or your neighborhood organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| We had none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| So there was no discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| You just knew about it because it appeared on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| There was no pre-discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| It appeared on the agenda for the MPC is when we learned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| Okay, and that's when you all formed your neighborhood association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| And at that meeting, the last MPC meeting where the USOM review was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| we did discuss with the operator our opposition to it, a very civil conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| There was no anger, nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| but we were very disappointed that they were not letting the community know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8566)|
| 2:22:52| what their plans were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| There was also some discussion that they were trying to account for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| and their time during the day and evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| and there was a lot of unaccounted for time that the residents had no activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8581)|
| 2:23:09| or couldn't be accounted for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| And so we have many concerns, many concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| And at the least, we asked for a postponement on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| just to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| The way we understand it now, we are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| So is there a compromise if there was community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| that everyone can sit at the table and talk about it for it to be approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8615)|
| 2:23:41| I'm not sure, because the recovery center, we are just as adamant that it's not a fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8621)|
| 2:23:50| for our community as they are that they say it is a fit for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8630)|
| 2:23:56| So I'm not sure that with what we know now that that would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8636)|
| 2:24:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| I was on the same track as Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| Do we have any meetings about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| I'm going back to the distance from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| That's already – do we know what the ruling is on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| And then I know you don't have a ruler right now to measure it all out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| but how does that currently play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| We have the measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| You do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| It's 883 feet from the corner of the house to the corner of Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8674)|
| 2:24:42| It's 883 and a half feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| And the rule is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8686)|
| 2:24:53| That's KGIS structure to structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| That was my main concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| Even at that middle of the school to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8704)|
| 2:25:09| it was less than 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| Amy, did you get the answer to that before Mr. Snowden comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| and answers the next question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| To where that is in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Yeah, the end code and if it's 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| I have not been able to find it in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| We have a reference to how close the facility should be to a bus or transit route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| or as an alternative, the applicant can submit a transit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| but I have not been able to find any reference to the 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| Meaning you haven't found a restriction that's 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| So where did that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| I'm not sure where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| It's not part of our staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8748)|
| 2:25:49| Mr. Snowden, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| I think it may be that there's, in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| there are, what is it called specifically, supplemental regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| One of those is recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| and there's others that I think that this lady is quoting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| requirements for location of operation of pain management clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| has the 1,000 foot rule that she's referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| The one for recovery housing does not have that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8784)|
| 2:26:25| So that's a different part of the restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| Thanks for the clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| I know we're on sector plan, but is the operator here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8799)|
| 2:26:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8806)|
| 2:26:54| I don't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| Commissioner Bussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| We have people come in here with property and regular PR zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8820)|
| 2:27:04| and other zonings, and they're coming into neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| and they have community meetings over and over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| and try to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| And right here we hear that there was no community meetings at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| within that community, and then all of a sudden it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| Were there any discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| And that's what we've always asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| What did you do before you got here to make this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| to take care of some of these problems or questions that the community had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| Well, that wasn't done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| and that was done by one of our agencies that we depend upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| to help us along to get compromises together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| And I'm not sure that I could support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| without that community involvement at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8872)|
| 2:28:02| Mr. Beeley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| If I may have the last word on this, and I am prepared to offer a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| We all know these are hard, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| Land use issues are the hardest thing we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| And, you know, there are people that I respect tremendously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| that want to see this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| I cannot support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| And I go back to what Commissioner Schoonmaker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| the Carter Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| If we have hopes for the Carter Town Center, this is not the right start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8917)|
| 2:28:43| And I know the Carter Town Center, four way in, has seen its better days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| That's true of every town center along the old U.S. highway system, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| That used to be a really important junction between 11, 70, and 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| The interstate's changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| Some of those areas are coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| and I believe have the opportunity to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| Mr. Snowden can tell you, and I won't put him on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| but when he asked me very early on in my term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| what's an area in the 8th District that you see as a potential town center development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| and the first one I named was four way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| I do have hopes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| I believe they can come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| Honestly, I think the Carter community feels unseen and unheard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| And I have a problem with that as the 8th District Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| So I move that we deny this request for the text amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| First by Commissioner Buehler to deny 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| Is there further discussion on item 78?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| Okay, seeing none, all those in favor of a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=8995)|
| 2:30:02| Just want to make sure we say it out because it's like a yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| So this is a motion to deny 78 sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9007)|
| 2:30:10| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9010)|
| 2:30:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9013)|
| 2:30:16| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| I didn't see any, I didn't hear any nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9026)|
| 2:30:28| So that's a unanimous denial of 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| Amy, what does this do to the previous zoning that was before planning in the month of May, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9035)|
| 2:30:45| Are you referring to the next agenda item that's before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| The first recovery house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| What does that do to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| The property at 8537 is already zoned OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| So they can't have the recovery house there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| Just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| You said the previous property was already zoned OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| When you did the town center, was that a grandfathered zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| We think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9075)|
| 2:31:16| I think it's been there for, we think it's been there for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9076)|
| 2:31:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9080)|
| 2:31:21| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| So 78 is now done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9086)|
| 2:31:29| We'll move to 79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| Madam Clerk, if you'll read the caption, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| This is item 4-L-21-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9093)|
| 2:31:38| It's a request of Will McCartin, Robert Vaughn, for rezoning from A, Agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| to OB, Office, Medical, and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| The property is located at 8535 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| Parcel ID 6221101 in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| Is the applicant present on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9114)|
| 2:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| Was the applicant notified of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| We put in a, we send them a, I don't know, I think it's a yellow, bright yellow sheet of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9131)|
| 2:32:18| And we also notify them via email as part of the staff report as well, letting them know the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9142)|
| 2:32:23| I mean, it's been fairly well precedent by this commission that if an applicant's not present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| we push it back a month as a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Is it even applicable since we didn't change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| and the sector plan doesn't allow for the zoning change within the town center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9159)|
| 2:32:46| They had originally requested office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| We had recommended denial of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| The proposed plan designation they requested was office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| So, I mean, you could move forward with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| but it would still need to come back to Planning Commission if you all wanted to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| for reconsideration of the sector plan amendment that they had requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| and had been recommended for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| Commissioner Bealey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| Well, I mean, I'm not going to move for denial if the applicant's not present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| but I think we should be voting on what's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9200)|
| 2:33:23| not on what they thought they might have wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| And I will point out that as the 8th District Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9207)|
| 2:33:30| I have not been engaged by the applicant at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9210)|
| 2:33:35| Commissioner Skidmarker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Mr. Law Director, based on the situation that we're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| can we just go ahead and vote to deny this since they can't really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| delaying it 30 days is not going to do anything because we've already denied the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9226)|
| 2:33:52| I think the Commission has discretion to defer it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| but if they're not here, the Commission can decide on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| And you can vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| I want to point out, though, in our rules in Section F it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| if the applicant is not present when the item is reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| the item shall be placed on the Commission agenda for the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9248)|
| 2:34:11| The item shall be placed on the agenda for the following month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| for the applicant's failure to attend only once automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| If the applicant fails to attend subsequent zoning session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| the applicant shall be deemed withdrawn unless the Commission votes otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| So our rules state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| Commissioner Biggs, and then I'll come back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| Ms. Brooks, do you send basically reminder notice to Will McCardin and Robert Vaughn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9272)|
| 2:34:38| because of this to show up in 30 days for next month's meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9278)|
| 2:34:43| We can follow up with them, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| Typically when someone doesn't show up, we will follow back up with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| and remind them again that they need to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| In that, will you tell them the denial of this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| or will you just, in case they're not even watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| would that be information you'd make them privy to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| We can share that with them, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| Commissioner Smith, then I'll be back to Mr. Beeley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| Amy, am I correct in my assumption that since we didn't change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| the OB zone, that that wouldn't be a function we could legally do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| Correct. It's not allowed in the EC03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| And if we were to deny OB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9318)|
| 2:35:24| I know there are rules on how soon you can come back to MPC and Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| Would that, any other zoning, be considered different enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| to be able to come back within a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9333)|
| 2:35:38| For the same use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| They would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Different zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| So they want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9343)|
| 2:35:44| If next month they show up and we turn down OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| could they come back two months later and request office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| Yes, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9352)|
| 2:35:53| Or they could request PC or some other zone, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| But neither of those zones will allow for a recovery house, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| I think what, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| I think what you're getting to is the property owner still has rights to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| certain things with their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| So if we denied it, they still have rights to do other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9373)|
| 2:36:17| just not this one particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| But if we moved it, then they could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| we may be back in the same position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| Commissioner Bealy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| I was struggling a little bit with precedent because I don't recall us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| ever hearing a zoning item that could not be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| in that particular sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| I mean, maybe the applicant's always here and they just withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9397)|
| 2:36:42| I don't know how we, the mechanics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| But these are always paired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| And when the sector plan one fails, the zoning one is just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| I think what everybody's trying to get to is it a deferral or withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| a denial, because certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| some of those have different contingencies on what can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| and can't happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| I don't think anybody in our commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| we've always wanted to give the property owner optimal rights to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| to do something differently if this didn't work out, but that versus being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| But I think Ms. Brooks is saying if this was to be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| they could still come back under different options to apply for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| different zoning that might be an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| It could even be a medical office building instead of a recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9443)|
| 2:37:28| You know, there's lots of other options that they could choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| They just wouldn't be able to come back and request the OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9456)|
| 2:37:37| But I want to make sure, right, they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| But I just want to make sure if this is deferred for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| it's still going to be OB on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| They can't change what they're requesting between now and July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9465)|
| 2:37:48| No, they would have to come back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| They'd have to withdraw and come back through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| We don't have a motion currently on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| Would somebody like to make one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| According to our rules, we don't even have that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| It's just courtesy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| According to the rules, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| Unless you want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| Then they can choose to withdraw it or go back through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| and go through it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9495)|
| 2:38:16| So, I mean, that is how it's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9496)|
| 2:38:20| We can vote to suspend the rules and do something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| but that has been our precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| Amy, can they come next month if we defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| Our rules say that we're going to give them 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| Could they come next month and request office at that time and say, well, OB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9512)|
| 2:38:37| They would probably have to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Just confirming to make sure with the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| You guys are good, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9522)|
| 2:38:43| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9524)|
| 2:38:45| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9525)|
| 2:38:46| So they did request office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| See, they've already requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| And the recommendation was to deny office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| So their original application is for office, not for OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| No, OB is the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9542)|
| 2:39:03| And office was the plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| I think we need to move to next month and make sure we got our ducks in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9547)|
| 2:39:12| And make sure it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9552)|
| 2:39:13| Okay, so we don't really need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| With the applicant not being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9555)|
| 2:39:16| we can refer to Section F of the County Commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| and push this to the next month's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| and hopefully between now and then we can get some further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| I think our rule says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| But what we typically do is when somebody's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| we bump them to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| And then at that point we usually make a vote to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| Yeah, I don't think that, I mean, if they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9575)|
| 2:39:38| I don't see the purpose in waiting 30 minutes when they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9578)|
| 2:39:48| What does the body please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| Ask after the meeting if they showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| If they haven't, we move it to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| We will skip this item for a moment then and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| Where are we, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| So we're going to hold on 79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| Can I make one statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| I want to understand what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| This is deferred until the next month's meeting, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| It may be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| If the applicant doesn't show up in the next 20 minutes, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| And then they could come back and ask for the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| which we're hearing is not even allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| or they could withdraw, kind of go back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| and go back through the process as some other kind of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| or do something completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| Sir, the first part of this, the sector plan was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9636)|
| 2:40:39| Say again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| Sir, the first part of this, the sector plan was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| And we can't act on the zoning because the applicant's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| And in our rules, we just push it off to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| But when they come back next month, the zoning they're requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| is not allowed in the town center plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| So it really kind of forces them to go back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| or come back with another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| In the event that it does go to next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| I would invite the commissioners to go out and observe this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| and take a look at it, and that may help you make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9669)|
| 2:41:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9676)|
| 2:41:17| I believe we're on 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9677)|
| 2:41:18| Yes, that's item 5-A-21-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| Request of Clark Crossing LLC for South County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9682)|
| 2:41:27| from LDR Low Density Residential portion only to GC General Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9687)|
| 2:41:32| located at 7628 Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| parcel ID 137225 portion of in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9695)|
| 2:41:40| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| Okay, if you would come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| state your name and your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9704)|
| 2:41:52| Brad Westbrook, 43 Woodstock Street, Roswell, Georgia, 30075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9712)|
| 2:41:59| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9722)|
| 2:42:03| Hang with us for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9723)|
| 2:42:04| Ms. Brooks, recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9724)|
| 2:42:05| Planning Commission recommends County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| GC General Commercial because it is a minor extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| of the existing commercial node around the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| of Chapman Highway and Governor John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| as well as changing conditions in the area by a vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| Mr. Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Hey, Mr. Westbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9742)|
| 2:42:23| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9743)|
| 2:42:24| Talked to you on the phone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| Good to see you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9745)|
| 2:42:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9746)|
| 2:42:27| Can you tell me what you're going to do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| or is that still a top secret?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| I mean, everybody knows where the Old Duck and Donuts is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| right across from next to Freddy's and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| That's basically deserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| It's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| So they want to extend commercial there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9762)|
| 2:42:45| so there will be parking in other areas there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| which will be a big improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| Plus, we've got a red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| Plus, we can hopefully get some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| with the engineering on access to the Old Duck and Donuts site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9773)|
| 2:42:59| And I hate to say that other building right beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| We're still in negotiations with some of our tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| so unfortunately we can't disclose names at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| but I think they'd all be welcome additions to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| We welcome you all out there, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| If there's no discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| I would like to make a motion to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| for South County Sector Plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| from LDR to Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| to GC General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9811)|
| 2:43:32| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9812)|
| 2:43:33| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| We'll move to number 81, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| Stick with us, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| It's item 5-C-21-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| It's also a request of Clark Crossing LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| for rezoning from agricultural portion only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| to CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| The property description is the same as the previous item I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| Hey, applicant, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| Brad Westbrook, 43 Woodstock Street, Roswell, Georgia, 30075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9840)|
| 2:44:06| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| Ms. Brooks, your recommendation, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| Planning Commission recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=9851)|

| 2:49:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| If you would hold on just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| RA Low Density Residential zoning because it is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10206)|
| 2:50:09| with the sector plan and surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| by vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10211)|
| 2:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| Sir, we'll start with you and the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10213)|
| 2:50:14| If you want to just tell us about your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| and then we'll hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| Basically what we're doing is we're rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| We're applying for rezoning to convert an existing family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| into a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| We had originally submitted our building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| received approval from Knox County Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| and then later on a complaint was filed that because of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10233)|
| 2:50:38| of agricultural we were not permitted to have a duplex there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10238)|
| 2:50:42| because of the two-acre rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10242)|
| 2:50:44| which we'd already gotten about 60% through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| until one of the neighbors had filed a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| Then it went back to Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| and Codes was basically what you need to do is you need to have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| rezoned because you're going to have to go back to RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| and do a use-home review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10261)|
| 2:51:02| So that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10263)|
| 2:51:04| Hang with us for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| Ms. King, if you would state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| My name is Patty King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10269)|
| 2:51:10| and I live at 320 Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| I am speaking for the resident that is directly across the street from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10275)|
| 2:51:16| Their residence is 5512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| Her name is Summer Roderick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| and I will be speaking on their behalf as they have small children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| and were not able to attend tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| So the issue they're having with this, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| is it's directly across the street, and if it's a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| they're supposed to be like a 75-feet driveway to both houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| If that was to happen, first off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| it would go into their property right directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| Second off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| there has been rumors that this is going to be turned into a halfway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| house, which for that neighborhood, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| because first off, not only are there kids there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| but there's a lot of elderly people in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| and none of the neighbors want this house to be transformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10324)|
| 2:52:08| When they started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| the neighbors were not notified on what they wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| They were not notified on this new agriculture changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| None of the neighbors want this to become a duplex because of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| that they have so much going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10347)|
| 2:52:32| There's rumors that the taxes haven't been paid on this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| or this land in over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| There's also rumors that, again, it's a halfway house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| The person that lived there before had their kids taken from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| and they are part of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| So the residents across the street and the residents around do not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| this to be switched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| Hang with us for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10375)|
| 2:52:56| I'll let you, Mr. Mellon, if you want to address those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10376)|
| 2:53:00| Well, we are the builder on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| I have regular contact with the homeowner who lives out of state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| and the idea of a halfway house, I mean, there's just no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| I mean, county codes has our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| They approved them over a year ago, and we had to delay because of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| and then once we started back, the complaint was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| But neither here nor there, the plans are on file for exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10402)|
| 2:53:26| It's two separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10406)|
| 2:53:28| Basically, the house was rather large in order to be a single-family rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10408)|
| 2:53:33| and what we decided to do and applied to do and got approval to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10413)|
| 2:53:37| was to convert it into two really nice duplex units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| to where we could bring, you know, utilize the property more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| because it is an investment for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| But at the same time, it's not halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| I mean, the infrastructure, the plans would never even lend themselves to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| and why would we put $200,000 worth of remodeling into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| to turn around and make something that could never be used as a halfway house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10439)|
| 2:54:02| I mean, it's just not even realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| Now, as far as taxes, I do not know the tax situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| because I do not pay the taxes on it, but I'm simply the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| Ms. Brooks, is there anything that you can provide relative to the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10453)|
| 2:54:18| about the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| No, we have not reviewed the plans specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| or I'm not familiar, excuse me, with the tax situation either of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| Again, we're just considering all the uses that are allowed in the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| Mr. Sodney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| Yeah, the gentleman is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| The house is quite large, and it was my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| are you doing like one level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10480)|
| 2:54:42| or is there going to be one level for one resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| and the other level for the other resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| So it's my recollection that the plans in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| complied with what this gentleman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| I don't know who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| I did get an opportunity to check on the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| They have been paid in full, but I do think there is some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10502)|
| 2:55:05| If you all look at your map on page 5 in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| the 5501, which is directly behind that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10509)|
| 2:55:13| that's actually a parcel that is located in tax sale 23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10513)|
| 2:55:18| at the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| That is a larger parcel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| So maybe there might be some confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| There's also some acreage that goes with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| So just letting you know that after looking further into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10528)|
| 2:55:32| that's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| But the property taxes are paid in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| I want to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10544)|
| 2:55:49| This gentleman says that he submitted plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| and got approval on a permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| Did his plans show it as a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| two different levels with two different entrances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10558)|
| 2:56:01| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| I was actually trying to pull up the original file permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| because I believe you're correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10565)|
| 2:56:08| but I'm trying to verify that, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| Okay, if you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10570)|
| 2:56:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10571)|
| 2:56:12| The plans were submitted, just for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| the plans were submitted with as-built versus proposed drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| and the site plan was submitted also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| and it was personally drawn by me with the ag zone on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| on the plans, and they were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| as you can look through the code's records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| as to zoning and as to the plans themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10590)|
| 2:56:37| Commissioner Daley is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10597)|
| 2:56:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| Did your plans, just to follow up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| your plans did say duplex on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| They showed two separate drawings with a master upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10607)|
| 2:56:50| a master downstairs, the kitchen upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| the kitchen downstairs, the separate entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| I don't know if the word duplex was on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| but it was pretty much obvious what it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| Well, I could see codes thinking that that's one building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| I mean, until inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| Jim, did you understand, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10629)|
| 2:57:10| Did you understand the question about 75-foot driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10630)|
| 2:57:14| I necessarily did, and I went out and looked at this complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| or this concern, and looked at the general road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10638)|
| 2:57:22| This gentleman's property, or this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| is fairly near Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| and the road from their location to Tazewell Pike is suitable for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10648)|
| 2:57:34| as far as width, I think it was like 17 or 18 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10654)|
| 2:57:37| so for the additional trips that this would generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| we felt like there was adequate infrastructure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| from a roadway perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| Ms. King, where did you get the 75 feet from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| I know that you're coming late to the game on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10669)|
| 2:57:52| Yes, I just got all this information yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10672)|
| 2:57:56| My friend knows that I come and speak to you guys quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| and she asked me to speak to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10680)|
| 2:58:03| on behalf of the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| She got that from another resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| that has been doing all the research for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| because, like I said, that neighborhood is full of elderly adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| and young families with young kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| and so what they understood is for it to be a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| it had to have two driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| and they had to be 75 feet apart from each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| to be able to get into the duplex standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| and the concern of the neighbor directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| is that 75 feet, because that would put it into her driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| and her yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| And that is the person I'm actually speaking for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| because she has lived there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| She knew the people across the street when she moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| She has met the owner of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| She has not met with you, I do not believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| but she has met the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| The owner has a bunch of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| and said that when they bought the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| they said that they were going to use that as a vacation home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10750)|
| 2:59:13| That is why they bought that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| and then the construction started without them knowing about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| and that's why I'm here tonight speaking on their behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10759)|
| 2:59:22| is because, again, they were not notified of any of the zoning meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10762)|
| 2:59:27| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| Well, you'll notice on duplexes, we go home there at Crenshaw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10769)|
| 2:59:34| and Martin Mill, how many driveways have you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| Yeah, I know. It's one. I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| But like I said, this is what has been brought to their attention in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| so that's why I'm speaking on their behalf today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| And again, there was no notification to any of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| about the zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| Unfortunately, the way I look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10792)|
| 2:59:54| I know it's in Commissioner Durant's district there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10794)|
| 2:59:58| but it's in the urban growth, and the only concern I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10798)|
| 3:00:04| but it's in urban growth, though, so, you know, changing the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10804)|
| 3:00:10| goes with the land forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10810)|
| 3:00:12| Oh, yeah, I know that because of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10812)|
| 3:00:15| That would be my only concern, but being in the urban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| it would be hard for me to vote no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| Commissioner Stiff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| May I say one other thing, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10826)|
| 3:00:27| We, since the first day, and this has been a protracted process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| because one of the things when we first started it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| we first pulled the permit, we could only work on parts of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| because the rental agent had moved a family in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| and we wanted the rental family gone as badly as anybody else did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10842)|
| 3:00:47| to be quite honest, because it is so hard to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| what needed to be done with them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| Then COVID hit. We couldn't get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10851)|
| 3:00:54| They finally just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10854)|
| 3:00:56| I think they were trying to get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10856)|
| 3:00:58| So I understand the neighbors' concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| and I think a lot of the animosity or maybe the bad feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| is the neighbors that were there, and they were terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| I mean, I'll just be the first one to admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| I didn't rent to them, and we tried to get them out as soon as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| and they finally just had to leave because they left, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| without the eviction moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Well, I mean, I want to make sure we focus on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| I'm sorry, my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| I want to just make sure we sort of stay on track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| The thing is, and where I'm going with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| is I have met the neighbors to the next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| and I've seen the lady across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10890)|
| 3:01:33| I've waved and spoke to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| I mean, we've tried to leave those doors open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| because any time that we're in an area doing a remodel especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10897)|
| 3:01:42| we're going to have to be sure that the people around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| you know, there's got to be that interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| There's some things we can't avoid, some things we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| and we try to take that step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10910)|
| 3:01:52| We have tried to leave an open door, and even at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10912)|
| 3:01:57| I tried to discuss the lady that had the problem with us and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10917)|
| 3:02:06| and I said, listen, bring me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| if there's something you need me to do with landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| if there's something you need me to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| if there's things, ideas that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10932)|
| 3:02:14| that will make this fit better in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| even though we're basically at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| We're not in the back of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| If there's things we can do, tell me, and she just walked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| So I think whatever we do there, they're not going to be satisfied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10952)|
| 3:02:36| Reading the comments, there's a comment that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10956)|
| 3:02:41| is US Home Review in agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| Can you put a duplex on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10964)|
| 3:02:50| It's under an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| Well, it says feed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| You got an acre, and then I see one place where it's calculated at nine-tenths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10975)|
| 3:03:00| Is that the reason why you can't have a US Home Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| to get to the duplex in the agricultural zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10983)|
| 3:03:07| Our understanding was Zone A required two acres for a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| according to the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| And we didn't know that, of course, until the complaint was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| and it just got past Knox County codes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| or we'd have never started this until we did the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| if we had known that it wasn't allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11004)|
| 3:03:26| We submitted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11006)|
| 3:03:27| They were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11007)|
| 3:03:28| We proceeded in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| I think everybody did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| I don't blame Jim's guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11013)|
| 3:03:34| I think you get a set of drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| and there is a good possibility that somebody does put a set of stairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| on the outside to an upstairs on a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11020)|
| 3:03:44| Quite often people do that with decks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| and I don't know how your drawings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11026)|
| 3:03:49| It could be coming in to the second floor onto a large deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11029)|
| 3:03:53| not just a normal front stew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11033)|
| 3:03:58| The upper level, it has an existing porch that we removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11038)|
| 3:04:03| and it's got an 8-by-12 deck that's about three foot off the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| and three to four foot off the ground, it's the second entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11046)|
| 3:04:09| But it was an existing entry we just replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| The property was, even though there was, I guess, one resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| it had the two kitchens already, the kitchen upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| the kitchen downstairs, the bathrooms, the separate water heating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| I mean, it was, for all intents and purposes, a duplex at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| It just had a continuous staircase inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| that brought the upstairs and the downstairs together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| whereas that's been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| And your plan showed that eliminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| Oh, yeah, the proposed, and we've already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| We've already framed and closed the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| and divided the upstairs and the downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| The only way you get in the bottom is through the entrance where the driveway is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| and the only way you get in the top is through the entrance where the driveway is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11089)|
| 3:04:53| Okay, and the two acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| Minimum two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11098)|

| 3:05:02| This your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11102)|
| 3:05:08| That was going to be my question as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| because I was looking at the duplexes being permitted and the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11110)|
| 3:05:19| With that, I move that we recommend approval as written by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11119)|

| 3:05:57| That's why when the complaint was filed it was such a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210628?start=11157)|
