| 2:12:29| And, you know, there was a quote, you know, that I forgot it was in some of the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| But, you know, people are moving to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| They like it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| And then are we going to change it into a place that people want to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| So, you know, those are my thoughts, and I am going to support this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7965)|
| 2:12:53| Who was next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| Council Member Ryder or Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| I mean, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| I'm not going to support the appeal because I feel, and I'll just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| I feel like I need to defend the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| The one-year plan here states duplexes should be allowed where one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| or more of the following conditions exist, and we just passed the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| So if we think it shouldn't be one, we think it should be five or four or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| then that's where we should have struck it and we should have changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| This lot is definitely a buffer between residential and non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| It is, there's a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| It's residentially zoned, but it's not a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| So I don't think that the Planning Commission bent any rules by applying that as a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8019)|
| 2:13:46| Now, we haven't given them a definition of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| and I do think they're a little creative in figuring out the density part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| But it is also, I just want to be clear, Mr. Frost, this is not a rezoning request, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8033)|
| 2:14:00| The lot is R-N-1 and the lot stays R-N-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Okay, I wanted to ask someone else besides Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| So our zoning code says, as Vice Mayor Smith said, that R-N-1 is predominantly single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8047)|
| 2:14:16| but we don't have any strictly single family neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| It says predominantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| This is one or two blocks off of a pretty major street that cuts from Middlebrook to the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8061)|
| 2:14:31| and it's 19,000 square feet, and our zoning code, without a zoning change, allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| with a special use review, a duplex on 15,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| So it has plenty of land to meet our standard, our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| It is allowed in the, R-N-1 allows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| It's in the land use tables, low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| and also we all just sat here and unanimously voted for R-N-5 next to a church next to R-N-1 on a much smaller street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8092)|
| 2:15:03| And I think when I compare and contrast the two, and I stand behind my vote of my other one as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8103)|
| 2:15:10| that I feel that it's in harmony with and matches it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| And I understand where people, you know, people buy into a neighborhood expecting one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8114)|
| 2:15:21| but the church is from 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| I looked at the aerials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| This was all farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| It's progressively changed and progressively changed and progressively changed over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| and it's still lot, large lots, and it's still zoned for 10,000 square foot lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| and it's still zoned for 15,000 square foot minimum for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| It meets the standards, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| I don't think the planning commission overstepped in their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8147)|
| 2:15:53| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| I agree with a lot of what Councilwoman Ryder just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| I'll say I just wanted to add that I think that Councilman Thomas's comments around how this should be very careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8159)|
| 2:16:12| about special use within any neighborhood I think is spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| Also lean, though, on this side towards another favorite saying of yours that I think each parcel is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8178)|
| 2:16:25| and I think this is an opportunity that I think is unique and that doesn't detract from anything in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8185)|
| 2:16:33| And I also think, you know, I've heard from a lot of people I know in West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| and I agree with their sentiment that it is a predominantly single family home neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| It has been that way for a long time, should remain that way, and I think the zoning allows for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| But I do think when you weigh that these four aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| and I think Councilman Fugate made a good point that there's four aspects that the planning has to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| Some of them are contradictory or seemingly contradictory to the woods and shelves and haves and should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| So I think that's why the planning staff looked at this on the whole and said this makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| The parcel next door may not or the parcel down the street may not, but this one particularly makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8229)|
| 2:17:16| So I just want to say that special use is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| It should be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| It should be very heavily scrutinized, and I think this one has been to a necessary degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8240)|
| 2:17:29| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| Yeah, I'll just briefly add, I suppose, that I'll kind of underline my concern about the kind of the slope that we're heading down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8251)|
| 2:17:41| as far as the lack of respect for existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| I think we need to be very careful about this, and I will reiterate my desire that developers look at available property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8268)|
| 2:17:59| where they can build without having these zoning fights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8279)|
| 2:18:08| because the zoning fights are one of the most divisive things in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| And as long as developers keep building carte blanche where they think they can get a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| we're going to continue to have these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| And it puts property owners against renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| You get issues about race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| You get issues of income versus low income, and we get that almost every time that we have a zoning thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8310)|
| 2:18:40| We heard that all through the stuff about also ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| You know, we heard about redlining or this or that or how some people who own houses are against renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8324)|
| 2:18:52| you know, low income versus high income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| These kind of zoning issues are divisive in this city, and they breed cynicism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8335)|
| 2:19:04| And I think we should take a hard look at continuing to try to develop in areas where you have to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8344)|
| 2:19:15| You know, let's go to areas where the zoning fits what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8355)|
| 2:19:22| And I think that's mainly what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| And we can keep going down this, and we'll keep having divisive fights like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| but, you know, I'm just one voice, but that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8371)|
| 2:19:38| Just a point of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| This is not a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| This is just a use on special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| It's a distinction that I think is important to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| Well, I think in general it's not a really, really important distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| because I think we're talking about making exceptions to rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| where the rule is established in a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| and they have to come in and get something changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| So I would respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| Technically, you're right, this is special use and not rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| but my general comments were directed toward having developers to have to change something that is set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8413)|
| 2:20:22| in order to build the way they want to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| Mr. Brotherton, I thought I saw you waving your hand that you wanted to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| so I'll bring you down so you can tell us what you wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| I wanted to piggyback on, as he's coming down, what Council Member Thomas said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| There are design options out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| He held up the picture, which you probably can't see from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8447)|
| 2:20:50| of the proposed development for the duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| but there are design options that, as you drive by, would actually look like a single-family house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| and would not obviously be something out of the ordinary when you drove through a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| We've seen that as we had the discussion about the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| so I'm just putting that out there that those exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| and this one, the design is very different from what the surrounding homes look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8473)|
| 2:21:19| Go ahead, Mr. Brotherton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| You were talking about the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| You kept talking about how big it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| Nobody ever spoke about how the shape of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| It's very narrow in the front, which is the main part, and in the back it is an L shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8489)|
| 2:21:35| There's a 33-foot section all the way across the back that's not buildable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| that backs up to the vacant lot of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| As far as this being a buffer, how can you say this is a buffer to a vacant field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8503)|
| 2:21:51| It's a field where they play soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| It's basically a flood zone, and there's houses all around it, all around the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| There's no need for a buffer for those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8518)|
| 2:22:01| Why do we need a buffer at this particular lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| It's just silly to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| You're really stretching the rules here when the rules are pretty clear as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| I mean, you know, it's like we read you the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| The one your plan says has to meet one of these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8537)|
| 2:22:20| It meets none of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| I mean, if you're going to break the rules, why have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| I mean, it makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| I went around with a petition, you know, talked to all the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| I talked to 250 neighbors, and I finally just quit because we kept getting postponed, postponed, postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8556)|
| 2:22:42| It didn't matter because everybody was signing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| I mean, I maybe had three or four people that chose not to sign because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| they just didn't want to sign for whatever reason, but that's probably a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| We're talking about the law, and the law says, you know, it doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8576)|
| 2:23:04| It doesn't meet the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| So how can you say it does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| I mean, you're breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| I mean, that's the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| That's what we've all lived by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| The only other thing I wanted to mention, you know, I appreciate all the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8600)|
| 2:23:25| was just to clarify the motion because a lot of times when we're doing these appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| it becomes very convoluted, like what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| So just so you know, with the motion that's on the table right now with the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| it's a motion to approve the appeal, which would overturn the special use decision that was made by planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| So I just wanted to make sure everyone was clear about what we were voting on when we get to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| I think that planning did the job that they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| It's RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| There was a special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| Criteria was met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| We also, we keep, I know that we put rules and regulations in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| and it's our job to define those and make things fit into it in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8655)|
| 2:24:22| But we seem to not be thinking about the big picture of our housing situation at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8662)|
| 2:24:28| They are interconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| I'm not saying just make every place open for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| But this went by all of the rules that they were supposed to do, by all of the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8674)|
| 2:24:41| And I understand people don't like change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| But as Councilwoman Ryder was saying, at one point this was agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| Things are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| And I think this is a very small change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| We're talking about, when I'm saying that we need to see this in the big picture of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| all we're doing, what, we need 15,000, 20,000 units in order to start getting things affordable around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8700)|
| 2:25:08| We're talking about instead of one unit, two units of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| It's a very small step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| But it's these small steps that we need to keep in mind that all of this has gone into creating the problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8715)|
| 2:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| Well, I know you've got a lot of concern about the housing shortage, obviously, and I totally respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| This is not going to, obviously, solve the housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| I mean, I am looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8740)|
| 2:25:44| And to continue to undermine existing neighborhoods with these, what you think are incremental changes that are going to start eating away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8744)|
| 2:25:53| you know, at the harmony of the neighborhood, the sense of community, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| The bigger picture is all this blighted property that's not being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| We continue to try to solve the housing shortage by shoehorning density into neighborhoods that are already dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8765)|
| 2:26:15| And you can do the math, and we're not going to solve the housing shortage that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| The bigger picture is to get really proactive and creative and put our energy into developing all this blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8779)|
| 2:26:28| We've talked about a lot of it's on the corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| Get it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| You can build more than a duplex in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| So when I oppose, I suppose, or have concerns about what we're doing here today, I think we're not looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8797)|
| 2:26:53| And I think this is not progressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| This is backward, in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| We're trying to do stuff the way that we've done it years and years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8818)|
| 2:27:03| A lot of the cities that have done this, people are fleeing those cities and they're coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8823)|
| 2:27:10| And then are we going to change our city to the type of the city that people want to flee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| We can do something different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| We can do something creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| It won't be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| But going down the path we're going, this is not progressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| This is old school stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| This is the stuff that we've been doing unsuccessfully in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| If we really are serious about solving the housing shortage, we will change our paradigm of thought and start doing something creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8851)|
| 2:27:41| And then other cities might say, look what they did in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| I don't want to do it like Minneapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| We've got a great city in Knoxville and I don't want to see us blow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| And what I'm asking for is for us to do something outside the box, not crazily outside the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| but really start looking at available property where we don't have these fights with neighborhoods all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8879)|
| 2:28:07| I think all of us would get on the same page if we took blighted property and put it back on the tax rows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8887)|
| 2:28:15| and you could build more density there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| And it would be inside infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| A lot of it is where infrastructure already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| So, you know, I'm not like being stodgy about kind of protecting, you know, a particular old way of looking things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8903)|
| 2:28:32| I'm looking ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| I'm looking at something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Council members, I just want to say I appreciate planning staff's analysis and recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8917)|
| 2:28:44| That's the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8924)|
| 2:28:45| And I appreciate planning commission's lay review of this and their unanimous support for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| And I just want to say I think that the proposed duplex is consistent with the city's overall housing plan towards more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8929)|
| 2:28:58| It's one small step, as Ms. Singh said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| Council member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8940)|
| 2:29:02| And I'll go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| Respectfully, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8945)|
| 2:29:13| I felt that you were really talking down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8953)|
| 2:29:21| That's the feeling that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I think that at one point we're talking about we're breaking rules and then at another point we're talking about doing the same old thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8963)|
| 2:29:32| Which one is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| Are we just going rogue or are we going by the process that we put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8973)|
| 2:29:38| And that process, it's not that I'm not saying this is going to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| I'm saying a whole bunch of these, the blight, the corridors, all of these, it's a both and all the time situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8984)|
| 2:29:54| I think it went by the process it's supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| I think the process is too stringent and would like to see more outside of the box thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=8997)|
| 2:30:03| But this is very much in the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| We did it the way we're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| Sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| I'm going to go to Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| I turned on my mic to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| And I could say 15, but I'm going to spare us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| Charlie, I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| And so I'm not going to respond to some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| I think some of them maybe we just need to debate it over a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| Maybe we have to bring our attorney, but it won't be regarding something we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| Here's what I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| For those who are here for the appeal and not for the appeal, I think it's really important that I say that this would not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9035)|
| 2:30:45| This would not be here as a change if it was not here for an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| And I'm not knocking anyone for bringing it here for an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| I just want it to be really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| This is allowed in RN-1 as a special use, which, by the way, Ms. Brooks, I know it's not your fault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9055)|
| 2:31:02| but I would like to go back to the title of use on review from the old code, shame on Cameros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| I don't like the word special attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| Use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| We are reviewing a use that is allowed as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| It is not special, and I think it deserves it by calling it special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| So I didn't turn on my mic to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| I still have three minutes, so I can preach about it if I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9081)|
| 2:31:24| I have a lot of feelings about Cameros, and that's a whole other topic, so I'll stay germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9084)|
| 2:31:32| I'll just close by saying I'm a little saddened that we're talking about duplexes the way that we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9092)|
| 2:31:40| and I probably shouldn't go deep into that, but I do not believe duplexes will be our undoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9100)|
| 2:31:46| I believe just like you do that our blighted, vacant corridors need to be in use and everything on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9106)|
| 2:31:56| If I won the lottery tomorrow, guys, I'd buy them all, and they'd all be in use, and, boy, they'd be alive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9116)|
| 2:32:02| and they'd be jazzed up because I'd have enough money if I won the lottery to get the folks that are holding them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9122)|
| 2:32:09| and won't sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| Many of them don't even live in our community or our county, and we've talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9130)|
| 2:32:17| So I'm going to have to agree with Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| It's a both, and let's just make this a confessional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| I don't like the design of what you proposed in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| Sorry, Mr. Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| I'll be happy to redesign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9149)|
| 2:32:30| I know some wonderful architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| There might be one or two in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| There's one in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| I just threw you under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| You should go use him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| It might cost a slight bit more, but also couldn't you build the same thing if it was single family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| And I think that's the thing is there aren't design standards, and there aren't an overlay that would dictate that you couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| So I'm not voting against it because I don't like your design, because that's not what I'm being asked to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| I'm not voting for it because I know we need 15,000 units of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| and every day someone's begging me for a place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9182)|
| 2:33:05| and I do not believe it's going to bring the ruin of anyone's neighborhood for a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| So again, in closing, I turn my mic on to say this is only here because it's an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9191)|
| 2:33:17| It is not part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| It would have never come to us, but for it is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| I'd just kind of like to close this out by saying I think all of us are passionate, and we love our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9208)|
| 2:33:35| and we want to do what's best for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| I think we as a council are people who have different opinions about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| That doesn't mean anyone on this panel is good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9225)|
| 2:33:48| We just have a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9228)|
| 2:33:50| That's called governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| I struggle with this one because I agree with everything that's been said, every bit of it on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9232)|
| 2:34:02| I think my struggle with some of this is that basically what we have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9242)|
| 2:34:09| as I interpret it from the Planning Commission, and I'm not saying it's right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9249)|
| 2:34:14| but basically the argument that that is a buffer means that every single family home on that side of the street is a buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9254)|
| 2:34:24| and I'm not sure what they're buffering other than the other side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| So that's one of my concerns about that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9270)|
| 2:34:34| But other than that, I'm calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| Is there a second for the motion to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| All those in favor for the motion to call for calling for the question, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| The motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| I'm opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| The motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9292)|
| 2:34:53| I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| Carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| I mean, our chair could have let you know that, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9298)|
| 2:34:59| Do you want to re-vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9300)|
| 2:35:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| The motion's been made to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9302)|
| 2:35:04| Passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| So the motion on the floor that Councilmember Roberto made was to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9305)|
| 2:35:14| And by approving the appeal, that means denying the property owner the special use to build a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9314)|
| 2:35:22| Does everyone understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| A yes vote means denying the duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| I think we need a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| Councilmember Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| Did you call me first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Councilmember Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| I vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9354)|
| 2:35:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9355)|
| 2:35:56| Councilwoman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9356)|
| 2:35:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9357)|
| 2:35:58| Councilwoman Helsley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| Councilwoman McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9366)|
| 2:36:07| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9369)|
| 2:36:10| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| The vote is four in favor, five opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| The motion to grant the appeal fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| We need a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| So now for the lawyers to be satisfied, we need a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| That's what they say, to hold up in court and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| Does someone who is one of the five who voted against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9392)|
| 2:36:37| I'll make the motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Motion's been made to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| All those in favor of denying the appeal, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| All those opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9411)|
| 2:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| I think the votes are the same, five-four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| Councilmembers, do you want to take a recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| Let's reconvene at 845.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9431)|
| 2:37:12| We're back in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9432)|
| 2:37:17| We'll move on to item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| I think we have a quorum, so we'll move right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| Lindbergh Forest Neighborhood Association to award a micro-grant in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9446)|

| 2:37:38| Move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9460)|

| 2:37:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9469)|

| 2:37:53| First person signed up to speak in favor is Karen Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9473)|
| 2:37:59| Ms. Adams, if you could state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| Also, thank you for serving on Planning Commission, as a side note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| Thank you so much, and thank you for all of your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9485)|

| 2:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| My name is Karen Adams, and I live at 211 Druid Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9490)|
| 2:38:17| I am surprised to say that I have lived at that address for 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9497)|
| 2:38:22| I didn't ever expect to be able to say that, but I love the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9502)|
| 2:38:28| and I'm so excited that over the last year we have worked to restructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9508)|
| 2:38:33| and really refocus our neighborhood association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| I would like to thank Councilman Smith for his support and help with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| and Debbie Sharp from the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| who has also been a real help in our reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9525)|
| 2:38:52| I would like to ask for your support this evening for this micro-grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| to help Lindbergh Forest Neighborhood Association continue to strengthen our efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| specifically to get greater engagement from our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| and also to help us with the investigation of the historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| Another person has signed up to speak in favor of Item 11A, Michael Fuller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| Mr. Fuller, if you could state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9559)|
| 2:39:22| Thank you, Honorable Mayor Kincannon, and thank you, Councilman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9562)|
| 2:39:26| and the rest of the Council members for hearing us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| I am here to speak in favor of this micro-grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| I was recently elected to be the president of the Lindbergh Forest Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9574)|
| 2:39:41| Unlike Karen, I'm a recent resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| I just lived in Lindbergh Forest at 312 Chamberlain for the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9585)|
| 2:39:53| However, I did grow up in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| I moved back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| My recollections of South Knoxville and Chapman Highway were not particularly great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| That used to be the Smokey Mountain Market, Kaz Walker's, and Uncle Easy's Pawn Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9603)|
| 2:40:11| But fortunately, through Google Maps, I found this wonderful little jewel called Lindbergh Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9611)|
| 2:40:18| And as Karen said, we've been reengaging the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| and there's a significant amount of interest about putting together a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9622)|
| 2:40:29| We've had Lindsay Crockett from the city come speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| and she was just wonderful in giving a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| So we will use this grant money to really try to engage the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9635)|
| 2:40:42| to build the support or to get their ideas and their thoughts about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9642)|
| 2:40:50| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9650)|
| 2:40:56| So we had also a couple from Forth and Gill come speak to our meeting last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| who went through the process, Bob and Melinda Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| So we've done some of the steps to get through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9665)|
| 2:41:09| but the really tough work is ahead of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| because it's the people who don't attend the meetings that we really need to reach out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9671)|
| 2:41:17| And so to make it much more easier than the process that you just went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| we're hoping we can do that in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| It won't be difficult, but it does take work and engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| So I do hope that you'll support this micro-grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Thank you so much for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9692)|
| 2:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9696)|
| 2:41:37| Council, that concludes people who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| I just want to heap some praise on Mr. Fuller and Ms. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| and to Mr. Hume if he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| You know, leading a neighborhood association through a certain chapter takes a lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| as many people up here can attest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| and particularly those that pick up the baton from the previous leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9715)|
| 2:42:01| It takes a lot of energy to reignite them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| and I was delightfully surprised by how many people were at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9723)|
| 2:42:09| and you all got a good thing going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| So I'm happy to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| I was struck by the small size of this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| and wondering why it needed city council approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| All grants that come from the city go to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| Procurements have a threshold, but grants are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| All grants of any size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| Okay, thanks for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| Is that correct, Mr. Evans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| I'm sorry, I should have let you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| Yes, ma'am, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| If it's a grant to somebody, it needs to be approved by the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9763)|
| 2:42:48| but procurements, like you said, there's thresholds involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9774)|

| 2:44:35| Thank you, Mayor, City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| My name is John Lawhorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9877)|
| 2:44:38| I'm with the firm of France McConnell and Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| and I am the lawyer who provides legal services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9881)|

| 2:44:52| My predecessor, who learned at his knees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9892)|
| 2:44:56| did that for 25 years before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| My firm is honored, truly honored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| to represent Knoxville Area Transit and the Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| And I can tell you personally, once you represent a client for 30-plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| that client becomes a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| And I am personally committed to transit in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| and to the transportation services in this city, as is my firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| So you've got a long agenda ahead of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| and I just wanted to introduce myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| and if there's any questions, I can certainly answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9928)|

| 2:45:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=9936)|

| 3:00:44| before second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| OK,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10849)|
| 3:00:50| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10850)|
| 3:00:52| for a project like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10852)|
| 3:00:59| when when planning is reviewing a project like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10859)|
| 3:01:10| are there concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| are there considerations taken when there are those limitations like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10872)|
| 3:01:17| railroad overpass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10879)|
| 3:01:20| Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| Currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10883)|
| 3:01:24| we don't know exactly what the applicant will end up doing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10888)|
| 3:01:29| It's already zoned are in for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| And so this request is to align the sector plans with the zoning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10891)|
| 3:01:36| they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10896)|
| 3:01:37| So if they were to come in for any kind of special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10899)|
| 3:01:40| we would take into consideration other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10900)|
| 3:01:44| And depending on what they proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| city engineering might also get involved as well as plans for unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| And so when we have a property zoned for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10911)|
| 3:01:56| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10916)|
| 3:01:57| medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| but the I know in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| it says we think that maybe because it's near another park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| they just put parks and refuges in here as a designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| Is that what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10930)|
| 3:02:12| Does that seem correct to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10932)|
| 3:02:13| Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10933)|
| 3:02:14| Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10934)|
| 3:02:15| I don't have that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| I was wondering the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10937)|
| 3:02:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10938)|
| 3:02:19| I think that could be potentially the rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| And also the property to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| just to the north there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| was the Alfred Buffett's homestead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| And so that could have been another rationale to place that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10949)|
| 3:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=10954)|

| 3:14:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11653)|
| 3:14:14| That being said, two years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11654)|
| 3:14:19| our brothers in blue are at DEFCON 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| They have 70 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11663)|
| 3:14:26| We're at like a DEFCON 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11666)|
| 3:14:30| We had like 12 currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| but we don't want to get to a DEFCON 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| in the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| I became a firefighter not for financial gains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| Like Scott Dorcott, I always wanted to be a firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11684)|
| 3:14:51| Just an angle, fourth generation firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| They didn't do it to become rich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| We love helping our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| We answer the call every time we get the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11702)|
| 3:15:07| We work 24-hour shifts, seven days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11707)|
| 3:15:12| 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| We can't put calls on hold, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11714)|
| 3:15:18| We simply answer them every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11718)|
| 3:15:21| Part of the problem is record inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11721)|
| 3:15:24| For the past two state of the cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11724)|
| 3:15:28| the impact of inflation has been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11728)|
| 3:15:32| the impact on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11732)|
| 3:15:36| This issue isn't unique to just the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| It affects the employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| We also are competing with other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11742)|
| 3:15:46| and we have some individuals leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| to start their own businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11748)|
| 3:15:50| just to support their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| I believe once again, it's time to boldly take steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11754)|
| 3:15:59| to improve our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| Salary increases are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| I think in a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11767)|
| 3:16:08| we're gonna do another compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| But if we take steps now and that study come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| you're at 1% of the market because of steps that you all took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11774)|
| 3:16:18| give yourselves a pat on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| I look forward to working with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11781)|

| 3:16:37| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11799)|
| 3:16:40| You have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11804)|
| 3:16:45| My last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11805)|
| 3:16:46| Vinny Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| Anastasio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11808)|
| 3:16:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11809)|
| 3:16:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| Sorry, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11811)|
| 3:16:51| I had to be correct. Sorry, I mispronounced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| Yeah, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| 21 Locust Street, apartment 1011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11813)|
| 3:16:54| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11814)|
| 3:16:57| Okay, y'all were talking about duplexes and all that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11817)|
| 3:17:00| I got a suggestion just popped in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| Have you guys ever thought about putting duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| on Industrial Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| Okay, because there's no property over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| There's a lot of vacant lots and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| and that would cut the housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11832)|
| 3:17:16| And Ms. Mayor, I am hoping in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| that you approve for paving on side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| especially Baxter Avenue, left-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| because I went down there on an ETHRA bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11846)|
| 3:17:30| and it's like bump, bump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| because there's so many patches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| Also, on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| okay, KB tore up next to Ace Hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11858)|
| 3:17:42| Okay, I asked the guys from Ace Hardware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11862)|
| 3:17:46| are you guys going to pave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| Because they put a water line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11869)|
| 3:17:50| Okay, they told them that's up to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11870)|
| 3:17:55| you know, the property owners, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11875)|
| 3:17:58| Okay, now, my main concern is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11878)|
| 3:18:01| is that when KB tears up a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| okay, they don't call the contractors, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| And then we, as residents who are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11889)|
| 3:18:13| because this happened up on Walnut Street and North Bind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11893)|
| 3:18:16| they tore up the water line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11896)|
| 3:18:18| and, you know, I spent six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11898)|
| 3:18:23| trying to get them to call the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11903)|
| 3:18:24| They finally did, because you had trolleys going over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11904)|
| 3:18:28| and it created a hole the size of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| I'd say about 12 feet at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| Also, there's also been a concern about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11914)|
| 3:18:39| you know, housing shortage and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| Yeah, that's true, but the problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11923)|
| 3:18:46| is that where do you, as a city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11926)|
| 3:18:50| draw the line when it comes to housing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11930)|
| 3:18:53| Because a lot of duplexes are being put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11933)|
| 3:18:56| There's not enough housing for low-income families, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11936)|
| 3:19:01| And there's not enough housing for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| who have low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| And the city council really needs to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| as a whole in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11948)|
| 3:19:11| And also, when it comes to snow removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11951)|
| 3:19:16| the side streets need to be a priority, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| not just the main streets, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| Because when you had the snow last year, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11961)|
| 3:19:26| especially like Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| there's a lot of people that go down Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11969)|
| 3:19:32| and I was surprised nobody got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| there were no accidents over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| on Jackson and Broadway, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11977)|
| 3:19:41| Also, the street that connects into Richard Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11981)|
| 3:19:47| that was never paved, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| That was just left pure snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| I mean, there's cars that still go over there, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| And then you got a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11995)|
| 3:19:59| that are coming into Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| and they're looking for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12001)|
| 3:20:04| and a lot of them cannot pay for condominiums or duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12004)|
| 3:20:11| because of housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| And that has to be a number one priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| for the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| because with your growth plan and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12019)|
| 3:20:23| it's gonna cause a major concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12023)|
| 3:20:26| with people that are moving to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12026)|
| 3:20:29| and they have families or in the low-income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12029)|
| 3:20:34| and they're gonna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12034)|
| 3:20:34| hey, we're gonna end up in a hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12034)|
| 3:20:37| for the rest of our life with our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12037)|
| 3:20:40| and then when we look at housing in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12040)|
| 3:20:45| or we're looking at an apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12045)|
| 3:20:48| it's not gonna be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| because houses are gonna continue to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12050)|
| 3:20:53| rents are gonna continue to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12053)|
| 3:20:56| and it's gonna cause a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12056)|
| 3:21:00| Me, I'm in low-income, I live over Selma Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| and I'm happy I got a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12064)|
| 3:21:07| because I'm a success story from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| I was in the mission in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12069)|

| 3:23:20| of city council, you know, that's not really relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12200)|

| 3:23:52| Like they're doing all this stuff in Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12232)|
| 3:23:55| like they're providing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| for like weapons guidance systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12236)|

| 3:24:04| but anyway, AI is terrible, don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12244)|
| 3:24:07| It's used a lot by Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| they've got data centers in Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| They really do support the occupation there, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| And y'all are just like, you know what we should do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| We should throw a ton of money at these guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| like ludicrous amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| Instead of like, I don't know, picking somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| Like there's gotta be like a billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| data companies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12264)|

| 3:24:27| Maybe pick something local, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12267)|
| 3:24:28| Like we got UT, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12268)|
| 3:24:30| Bunch of computer science students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12270)|
| 3:24:31| They can probably cook something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12271)|
| 3:24:34| What else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12274)|
| 3:24:35| Oh yeah, when y'all like voted down our resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12275)|
| 3:24:39| or actually didn't even like second them in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12279)|
| 3:24:43| which like what harm is it to like vote on something, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| Like ain't that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| That was kind of lame of y'all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| because like that was some pretty important stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12289)|
| 3:24:52| Like there's all sorts of terrible things going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| in the Middle East and Palestine specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12294)|
| 3:24:56| and y'all are just like, oh but it's not a local issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| And then you go and give money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12299)|
| 3:25:00| to companies that support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| So it's kind of hypocritical, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| Kind of silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| That's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12307)|

| 3:25:58| Imagine yourself in a war zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12358)|
| 3:26:02| and you're with your child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12362)|

| 3:26:12| gets airstriked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12372)|
| 3:26:14| Which is already derelict, gets airstriked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12374)|
| 3:26:18| And your child is caught in this airstrike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| There's dust flying everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12382)|
| 3:26:25| It covers your clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12385)|
| 3:26:26| It gets in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| It gets in your nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12388)|
| 3:26:30| You can't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| And all you're thinking about is your kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12391)|
| 3:26:34| Where is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12394)|
| 3:26:35| Is she okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| You turn around, and you see her lying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12397)|
| 3:26:41| splayed out, belly cut open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12401)|
| 3:26:46| from your collarbone to your pelvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12406)|
| 3:26:52| And you see her organs on display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12412)|
| 3:26:56| You can identify her liver, her stomach, her intestines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12416)|
| 3:27:01| And she's still breathing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12421)|
| 3:27:02| And you say, oh my God, I have to get her to a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12422)|
| 3:27:07| You pick her up in your arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12427)|
| 3:27:11| You carry her as if she is a dead body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12431)|
| 3:27:12| because she is on a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12432)|
| 3:27:15| And you push her together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| trying to keep everything that is vital inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12437)|
| 3:27:20| trying with all of your might to keep her alive enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| to get her to a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| that is already terribly under-equipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12446)|
| 3:27:31| because of the blockade that is going on in your country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12451)|
| 3:27:36| So you run through the rubble of the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12456)|
| 3:27:39| because this is not the first airstrike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| that has happened in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| And you run to this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| with your little girl in your arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12465)|
| 3:27:46| and she's still barely hanging on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| and you're wishing desperately for her to cling to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=12468)|
