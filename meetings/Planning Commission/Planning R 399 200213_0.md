| 0:01:30| and in the handout is the meeting schedule of these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| For matters that are forwarded to the county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=95)|
| 0:01:41| the applicant must be present at the county commission meeting at which the request will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=101)|

| 0:01:56| I would also like to refer you to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning's outstanding website, www.knoxplanning.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=116)|
| 0:02:06| for an online agenda and additional information on this and future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| Today's meeting will be conducted in the order of the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=131)|

| 0:02:19| After each item is called, I will read the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=156)|

| 0:02:47| The opposition also will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| If either side wishes to rebut, you will need to reserve time from your allotted five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| If you plan to speak on an agenda item, please sign in when you're at the podium so we have your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| Speakers should limit their remarks to the facts of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| and should avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=195)|
| 0:03:23| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item are asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| You will need to state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=216)|

| 0:11:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| And before we begin today's agenda, I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| I'd like to, on behalf of all the commissioners, thank Andre Canty for his service on the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| He was on for a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| He was appointed late last year and then had a job opportunity in Kentucky with Communities United.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| And so he's moving away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| His service to the commission and to the city as a whole is certainly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| He was involved in a number of organizations, including 100 Black Men of Knoxville, and served his community well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| His service on the commission, again, is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| And we'll miss Andre and the perspective he brought to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| So, again, on behalf of the commission and to the community as a whole, we'd like to extend our thanks to Andre for his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=769)|
| 0:12:59| So we are starting today's meeting with Agenda Item Number 10, Rezoning Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| The applicant is Stephen Nabe, Valiant Enterprises, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| And I apologize if I've mispronounced that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| The location is north of Tazewell Pike and east of Jacksboro Pike on the west side of Fowler Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| Approximate size of the tract is 0.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| The current zoning is RN1, Single Family Residential Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| The zoning requested is RN3, General Residential Neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry, and vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| The staff recommendation is to approve the RN3, General Residential Neighborhood zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| because it is consistent with the sector plan and allows construction of small-scale housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Sir, would you like to come and address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| If there's no opposition, I have nothing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| That's a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| I read in here that the applicant wants to build nine townhomes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=855)|
| 0:14:25| I looked at that last night, and that's a small street in a busy neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| that's just small, single-family houses on fairly large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| I just wonder about nine townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| It's not ñ it is the ñ it would look good if they had two townhomes ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| or not two townhomes, two homes in there rather than nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| If you look at the map, there's no high density in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=902)|
| 0:15:11| It's a scene that is way out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| And I'll try to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| We understand it's introducing a new type of housing into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| It's an area that under the zoning prior to January 1 of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| would have allowed a lot greater density with a lot fewer design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| The previous zoning was R2, which allows 24 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| or actually a bit more than a greater acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| We also were charged by the city council with the new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| into finding appropriate places for smaller scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| what we call missing middle housing, housing of this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| That's approximate to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| Even though this is a small street, it's within 100 feet or so of Tassville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| which is a major arterial in the city close to services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| and seems to be an appropriate place for this smaller scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| I realize it is a change in the existing development type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| but it is a development that would be reviewed by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Engineering, city engineering may want to address the street in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| and the ability to access that number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| Depending on what the applicant ends up submitting for a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| we may actually require that the road be widened to allow for two-way traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| So we would look at a minimum roadway width of 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| What is the roadway there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| I believe it varies as you come off of Tassville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| but a little ways into Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| It's about 12 to 13 feet wide approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Ms. Poche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Just a point of clarification, the applicant hasn't stated that he wants to build nine townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| That's just the maximum that would be allowed by the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| We don't expect that nine would be able to be built due to site constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| but the applicant can answer the number he has in mind more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| We haven't received a development plan for it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Our expectations were to get the zoning approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| and then spend the investment on engineering and site plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| and come up with a plan that is also cohesive for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| We also intend to speak with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| and make sure that they're in agreeance and concurrence to the best that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| With R and 3, this is a question for you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Will the concept plan or will the plans come back before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| Not before commission, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Will it come before planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| It will be reviewed by planning staff, engineering staff, plans review, inspection staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| pretty much a full gamut of staff review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Commissioner Smith, you did hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| The road question, he answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| My question was just consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| It's just a little neighborhood tucked in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and I was reading where nine townhomes, I thought, that ain't going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| That's way out of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Engineering is going to determine a lot on what's feasible on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| The lot closest to Tazewell Pike has some sewage and drainage setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| which is going to realistically alter the density to what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| It's also our intent not to alter the neighborhood in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| It's going to enhance the neighborhood in terms of property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| because what we're intending to do is probably three-bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| two-and-a-half-bath townhomes with garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| which should, in my opinion, improve the general neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| based on what's currently there in the general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I understand we're not voting on nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| We're just rezoning, but since it was in the write-up, it's got my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| And what we try to do is let the commission know what the maximum permitted by the zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| As Michelle said and as the applicant said, a lot depends on the engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| the site design, and the site constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| So, Gerald, this concept plan does not come back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| That's part of the recode that did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| And, again, under the zoning prior to the new zoning ordinance, the R2 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| the density permitted would have been greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| No plan review would have been required by the Planning Commission under that zoning either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| So even with the R3, I guess it would be considered a down zoning from the zoning prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| to the adoption of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| That's one case in point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| When we purchased the lot several years ago, it was zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| and I guess as part of recode, it got switched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I am in total agreement with Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| I went out there and the road really had me worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| It's just so narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| And also I feel whenever this board makes a decision on rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| the regulations do state that we look at the characteristic of the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| And I think reading that, I was like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I went, oh, my gosh, nine townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| This is going to be totally out of character with this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| But I trust that you will look at that and keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| I'd like to ask City Engineering if the easements are in place to widen Fowler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| or does that still need to be secured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| I think without a survey, it's hard to say definitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Just measuring on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| it looked like there was about 26 feet of what looked like right-of-way out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| So there appears that there's enough space to create a roadway surface that would meet the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Yeah, I'm okay with up to nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| because I think we're just saying that you have the flexibility to see what works best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| and we're giving you a range like we would in a PR zone of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And as long as the road is going to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| and that was the only thing I was concerned about, if improvements have to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| you won't be allowed to move forward without those being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| I do wish that I didn't understand that we don't get to see the concept plan again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| I would feel a lot better about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| And in light of the fact that I think we're given this zoning, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| I guess it just doesn't come through here anymore, but I think it would be good when we go through at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| that we see it again when it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| And again, keep in mind under the prior zoning, it wouldn't have come through here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| The prior zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Or to allow multifamily for this number of units without review by the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| But we are granting a new zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| We are giving him a higher density zoning, so that could have been a caveat of getting that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| The conditions can't be attached to zoning under the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Gerald, what zoning options are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| We still do have planned residential in the city, or is there no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Okay, that's only county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Only county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| What options are there as far as zoning with review by commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| Is that only when there's special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Only if it's identified as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| For example, in the R1 and R2 duplexes are a special use, so it would require review by the plan, we have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| That's good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| In the R and 3 zone, townhouses are a special use, so those would have to come through the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| So I'll say this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| In addition, if they decided to create lots, they may have to come through concept plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| But townhouses in the R and 3 do have to go through special use, which does come to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I'm trying to forget the pain of the new zoning ordinance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Everybody's happy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| This is going to be a learning experience for all of us as we continue to learn the new zoning for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the R and 3 general residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the R and 3 neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| I think that everybody's ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| We look forward to seeing you at the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| Agenda item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Applicant Scott Davis, Masana Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| The location is the west side of Thompson School Road adjacent to Wheat Meadow subdivision east of Coppock Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1499)|
| 0:25:09| The approximate size of the tract is 43.83 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| The zoning requested is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| It is currently vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Density proposed is one to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| The staff recommendation is to approve planned residential zoning with up to five dwelling units per acre because it's consistent with the northeast county sector plans LDR low density residential designation and is near Gibbs schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1533)|
| 0:25:51| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| The applicant, Scott, do you want the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I see three of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Have you folks, is there more in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| Do all three of you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| So do you want me to give you a heads up after about two minutes or a minute and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Madam Chair, I'm sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Due to the amount of correspondence that we all received, could we increase that to ten minutes for each body, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| Or would you like to do three minutes per person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| So it will be three minutes per person on the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| And then, Mr. Davis, you will have a total of nine minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| Thank you very much, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| If there's opposition that wishes to speak, your time is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| I'm here on behalf of Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| I'm going to just add a couple of comments and questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| One, this development is one that I've challenged the planning commission and applicant and stuff to consider something maybe a little bit more unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| possibly an agricultural conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| This is located out in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| And the idea of taking the houses or the residential units, clustering them in one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| and then leaving a bit of the acreage undeveloped as an easement needed over to agricultural purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1653)|
| 0:27:42| that could be an interesting way to, like, help the character of the community out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| and preserve that kind of sense of place that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| It's something that's new for Knox County, but I think that's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| and something that we actually challenge the development community to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| and look about how to embrace as you're looking at development out in the more rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| The second one is to consider not only, you know, I know there will be a few people who talk about local traffic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| but this one is located pretty far out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| There's really only about two ways that traffic moves into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| It either goes into Emory Road to the Interstate 75 corridor, and that's a very congested intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| We know there's TDOT plan to improve that, but, you know, that's a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| The other one is going down Tazeville Pike, and it looks like there's a fair number of trips that will be generated by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| I don't know, you know, what the traffic model is for this particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| but if you're talking about adding a few thousand more cars on Tazeville Pike after the cars that have just been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| you know, that may be approved for Beverly Road recently, that's an issue that I think you need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1723)|
| 0:28:52| Those are the two main ones that we wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| The third one is to remember that, you know, rezoning is a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| It's not a right, and so, you know, think through these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| as you consider the best way to rezone and the appropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Is there someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Adam Thompson, 7643 Cotton Patch Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| And have you already written down your information on the sheet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Okay, if you'll do that, and the clock won't start until you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Okay, sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| It's just so that we know, have your information for our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1768)|
| 0:29:39| Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Can somebody raise the podium a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Sir, right to the, yes, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1785)|
| 0:29:53| Isn't that fancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| It is fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| Yeah, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you for noticing that, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| It's Adam Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Thompson, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| I live off of Thompson School Road in Harbison Plantation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| And so I just wanted to start out and say we appreciate the opportunity to have this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| regarding the development and growth within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| As volunteers and fellow citizens of Knox County, we appreciate your all service and dedication to responsible growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| which allows new residences and businesses to live, work, and play in our areas that we've grown to love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| and call home, while maintaining the culture, beauty, and atmosphere that has made our rural communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| so attractive to folks who want to call Coryton home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| While Knox County Commission has suggested higher density developments be located near amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| like schools, like our new middle school there in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| we don't feel like this should be a cookie-cutter approach to every situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| It simply cannot work in every community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| I know we've heard from several neighbors, commuters, and parents with children who would be affected by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| But after Tuesday's agenda review, I don't believe the scope of these concerns were fully realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| And since my time is limited, I'll keep this to two of our biggest concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| which is traffic congestion that pours into substandard, narrow roads that destroys property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| risks safety to drivers and pedestrians, and compounds already existing congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| and are already cramped schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| First, this development would be the fourth and largest subdivision on the one-and-a-half-mile stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| of Thompson School Road from Carnes Drive to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| It would add an estimated 2,100 trips per day to this confined area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| This traffic would be traveling to Knoxville to work, as well as the Gibbs schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| like Mr. Murphy just mentioned a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| However, we're caught in the middle between a flood of commuters and parents getting their kids to and from school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| and that's where the alternate Carnes Drive-Barker Road route debacle comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Carnes Drive is a severely narrow, unpainted, single-lane drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| lined with driveways, mailboxes, and trees with two 90-degree turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Motorists are constantly required to drive into our yards to avoid oncoming traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| or stop in our driveways to allow others to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| The most recent closure of Thompson School Road forced this route to be the only access to Tassel Pike and our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| That two-month closure alone further destroyed the shoulders of this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| and made muddy disasters out of our yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| The residents on this road have been incredibly tolerant, but they've constantly voiced concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| about students and commuters speeding down this road to avoid backups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| at the intersection of Emory and Tassel Pike and the school zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| This is a dangerous shortcut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| The development is located only one-tenth of a mile from Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| Google Maps actually suggests that Carnes Road is a faster route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| than Thompson School Road to Emory Road to access the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| Which route do you all think that they would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| The adverse effects and consequences of this development on traffic, safety, infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| and private property are too great to allow such a high density in this already congested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| The other approach is looking at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| They're rapidly reaching capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Obviously, they're not quite there yet, but they're rapidly getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| And the recent addition of our middle school has been touted as a magnet for young families with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| That has been incredibly true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Many wonderful families have joined us in calling Coryton home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| However, while the middle school is new, it's already at 60% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| While that doesn't seem alarming, according to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| our elementary is already over 90% capacity and just added a 7th, 4th grade classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Those 4th graders will be the middle schoolers by the fall of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| Likewise, our high school is also over 80% capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Northeast Knox County has the highest inventory of undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| If we allow higher densities inconsistent with existing developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| we'll too quickly overextend our resources, our utilities, our infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| and destroy the quality of life that made Coryton such an attractive place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| We humbly request that you limit this residential development to 3.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| to make it consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Or if you like, if it would be possible to possibly postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| until we have a chance to speak with a developer, see what other ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| I know Mr. Murphy brought up a couple interesting ones as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| But there's also pictures that we weren't able to get into this presentation of Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Just because we can't bring you to Carnes Road, we're going to bring Carnes Road to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| But we just ran out of time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| We have one more person that would like to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| And, sir, have you written down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| Yes, I'm at the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Okay, awesome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| I'm Jimmy Darrell Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| My land is right behind the old Jack Davis farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| Now Don has it, their son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| My land is right up behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Is it to the north or to the south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| From where that is, let's see, the Dan Butler is below me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| My road is Majors Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| I'm at 7710 Majors Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| My farm, I've got nine and a half acres, and it comes right up to the back of the Davis farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2132)|
| 0:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Probably about, from where that is right there, there's probably about 150 feet or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2141)|
| 0:35:53| I was just curious where in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| I'm in the very back side corner of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Okay, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| So it's on Dan Butler's side where he has cattle too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| I want to know if this would hurt our land because I want to stay agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| It's always been agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Well, we moved out there in the 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| We've been out there a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And I've got a farm and barns and everything right close to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2179)|
| 0:36:27| You know, what kind of housing or whatever they're going to put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| because I don't want to worry about people coming over and trying to steal my stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| because I've got my delays and I hate to see them trying to get them through that cow pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| Yeah, Scott Davis, P.O. Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| I may need to lower this for me since it's short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Now, I appreciate y'all's time and I respectfully request approval per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| And as y'all may or may not be aware, the county has made significant improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and continuing to make improvements to Thompson School Road at East Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Major interchange work being done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I don't know how much, but quite a bit of money has been spent there to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| And Thompson School Road is a very, it's a lined road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| It's a good street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| And I don't think there's a lot of threats on Thompson School Road where this will tie into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| I'll go ahead and answer any questions y'all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| Commissioner Peston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Hi, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Doing very well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Have you met with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| It seems like that you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Until I got here tonight, I had had no communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| No one's called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| No one's emailed me or texted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I did not know I had opposition until tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| You know, as we've all, a lot of us have stated in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| that usually when you, you know, when the developer meets with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| and you guys sit down and collaborate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| that not only do you almost always come out with a better design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| but something that everybody can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| So I would like to see you meet with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| That's sort of been our stance for the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| So do you have an issue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| I never have an issue with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| but that burden shouldn't fall on me as the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| If I do not know there's opposition, they have access to my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| They have access to my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| They have access to my text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| And if we don't know we have opposition, I don't know who to reach out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| I do try to contact, in most cases, the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| But if we show up the day of the meeting and have no idea we have opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| there has to be some burden on the opposing party to make contact with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| if they're opposing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| And the adjacent homeowner, did he reach out to you, sir, Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| So I still will stand by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| I'd like to see him meet with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| And I'm always welcome to do so, and I'd never oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| I try to do the, if I know I have opposition, I try to make sure I contact them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| I meet with them when and if I know I have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| Mr. Green, I know that several years ago the planning department put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| that when there is a developer making an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| that there is several pieces of information that is given to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| and one of them is a flyer that indicates the strong suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| that the developer meets with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Is that information still provided to applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| We still have that flyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| I don't know if we give it to Mr. Davis every time he comes in because he's a repeat customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| but that information is still available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| Also, Mr. Davis, do you ever check the planning commission website before the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| Because there is always a listing of any correspondence that we've had on any particular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| And I know that requires you to actually go to the website and look for that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| but we've been receiving correspondence on this for going on about two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| and a lot of correspondence on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| So I'm surprised that this was the first you'd heard that there was opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| But that being said, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I'd like to clarify that staff's recommending five dwelling units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| but all the neighborhoods around it are developed, were approved to preclose that same density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| and most of those were built out at about 3.4, 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| Five dwelling units per acre approval doesn't mean you're going to end up with five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| It really does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Topography, sinkholes, everything else, it probably is not going to yield anywhere near five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| but that's up to the engineering and that's something we look at at a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| That being said, I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential zoning with up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| There's a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| to approve the rezoning with up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Commissioner Smith, you had your light on, and it's on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| I wanted to speak to the reaching out to the neighbors issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| I don't know if it even matters now, but I just think it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| as I've been in his shoes and I've been on the resident end also, and it's really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| there's postcards that are mailed out with rezoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| It's signed, and it's hard for a guy like anybody who's applying to do something with land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2524)|
| 0:42:13| that is not really out of the ordinary in that area that's adjacent to similarly zoned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| but, I mean, how do you reach out to people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Do you just go door to door and ask people if they have a problem with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| It really, I think, I don't know, but I feel like if anybody sees a sign go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| they probably will call the commission, get the name of the developer, and call them, because I do know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| there's hundreds of people that live around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| and I don't know how I would have gone about seeking to, you know, if nobody calls me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| do we just walk around and ask, knock on doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Yeah, I get it that it's a lot easier in the city where there's established neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| but there's neighborhood associations that are in place, and I get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| and perhaps there are no neighborhood associations out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Mr. Murphy, I think that you might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| I mean, Mr. Murphy, he's here a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| He's with the Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| I know that they know who Mr. Davis is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Maybe he would have called them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| So there is a Quariton Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| Mr. Thompson is one of the major representatives of that alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| That's a fairly newer alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Northeast Knox County does have kind of a lack of neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| We find organizing out there is a little bit tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| I will just speak to this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| When you're a community member, you see the postcard go up, you write an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| you hope somebody reads it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| A lot of these people have never been to a planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| This was Mr. Thompson's first time speaking in front of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| And a good job he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| Familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| My point is, though, you're familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| I mean, did you call Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| I've got a full-time job, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I've got a lot of stuff on my plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| Sometimes it's like yesterday when I finally get a chance to go through that lengthy agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| That's just how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| We're citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| We're volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| We're not developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| And we're here at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| Commissioner Eason first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| She had her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I am concerned about the five dwelling units per acre, whether or not that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| I am interested in potentially seeing something that's not cookie-cutter traditional neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| And I like the suggestion from Mr. Murphy of starting to look at something like the agricultural conservation developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| in our rural areas that would allow a concentration of the houses and then still preserve some open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Commissioner Griff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| We're talking about up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| And as Art Clancy said, that doesn't mean he'll get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| If we vote, you can still talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| I mean, it's not like it's all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| You can meet and talk and see what their ideas are and see how you go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| And we still have the concept plan in stage where we can communicate with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| That's what it's about anyway is a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy to approve the PR zoning with up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| That was seconded by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| And is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| That was a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| And we look forward to seeing your concept plan when you bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| And I'm sure that you're going to get with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| And if you guys can all exchange contact information, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| We are on to agenda number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| This is a rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| The applicant is Ben Mullins, OBO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| On behalf of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| On behalf of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| Gregory Jones and Stephen Owsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| The location is the west side of Wise Springs Road, north of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| Approximate size of the tract is 42.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| 42.01 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| The zoning requested is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| The existing land use is agricultural, forestry, vacant, vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| No specific density proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| But the staff recommendation is to approve the planned residential zoning with up to one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| because it is consistent with the northeast county sector plan for A, agricultural and hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2851)|
| 0:47:39| And it is consistent with the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Okay, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Again, we have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| How many people actually want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Did I see two hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Three hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| That are in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So as before, we have received quite a bit of correspondence on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Did I see three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Somebody said four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| There were three opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Four that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| So we're going to go with ten minutes for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| And, Mr. Mullins, you will have ten minutes also to make your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| That would be dividing each of your up to two and a half minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| So, Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| One of those that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| And, again, remember just not to repeat the same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| If you have new information to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| And so I will just kind of give you a heads up when you're at two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| And have you written down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I just want to say, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| this is probably everyone's first time to be at one of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| So I can't promise you that you won't hear duplication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| This is our first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| My name is Kathy King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I live at 4915 Wise Spring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| I have lived there for 34 years, but I live next door the other 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| So I've been a resident for 61 years in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| I want to just first say that I think, probably speaking for most everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| we do not feel that the community has adequately been informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| nor has the applicant given enough notice of the proposed intended changes to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| I just heard the information a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| Yes, I received my little card about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Yes, there is a sign posted at the entrance to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| but if you look at me as a person that's never dealt with zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| and I'm just trying to figure out what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| I called Ms. Liz on the phone, spoke with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| and tried to get the appropriate information from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| I understood that this is where I come to tell you that I'm concerned or opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| I was not told, hey, contact the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| The other thing is because of the rainy weather, because of the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| because of no schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| I do not believe that anyone has really had an adequate opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| to see the sign posted on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| And to my best of my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| only the people in the community that have land connected to that received any notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| No one else was informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Basically, our concern, just a few concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| is we understand there was a part of a potential boarding house, boarding home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3048)|
| 0:50:55| So we're not sure what exactly boarding homes mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| That's new to our concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| We're pretty much all agricultural in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| so we've lived in farms, cows, horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Those kind of things are what we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| So we don't really know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| The other concern we have is the one dwelling per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Now, I know that sounds like a big thing, but out there where we're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| everybody I can at least speak to that lives on Y Spring Road in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| has had septic grain field issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Most of us, more than an acre or an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| have had to put in a second drain field or extend our existing drain fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| So that land does not perk well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| We have a lot of wet springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| So that is a great concern for us in regards to the septic part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| There is a sewer line that runs through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| but it's our understanding we cannot connect to it because it's full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| because of the detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| So I think it goes below the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| So that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| I did want to let you know that you're at about two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| The other concern is the slaughterhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| That's an old area of the slaughterhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| There was a slaughterhouse there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| There was block homes for some of the workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| There was no inside facilities at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| So there's a question about possible toxic and or waste in that soil there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| and has any of that run off to the ponds and caused contamination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| The other thing is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| Within the last year and a half, just between my house and my neighbor's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| we've had three accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| We've lost mailboxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| I've had a stack stone mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| I've lost it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Ecological impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| What's going to be the ecological impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| We have deer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| We have turkeys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| We have bobcats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| We have all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| What's going to be the ecological impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| So basically my request is to request a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| until we can get this young lady's idea of meeting with a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| and working with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| And there is another person that wishes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3188)|
| 0:53:20| And, sir, have you written down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Okay, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| My name is Burt Farmer, Jr., 4733 Wise Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| I've been around 70 years there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| The speaker before me has basically covered everything I was going to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| The other thing is she's mentioned about the slaughterhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| I do know that the old slaughterhouse did have asbestos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| and it was actually bulldozed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| Any impact studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Anybody know of any impact studies been done as far as ecology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3240)|
| 0:54:08| environmental, or wildlife?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| We'll make sure that that question gets asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Also, I request a postponement until we can see a planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| an actual planning of what's going on in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| And, sir, if anybody has any questions, they'll call you back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| So don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| One thing that I did want to mention, Mr. Bomerich, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| We're not going to be seeing any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| because right now we're doing a rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| The next step after the rezoning, because this is planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| that's when the concept plan will be presented again to this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| again for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| So right now you're not going to be seeing, based on a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| you're not going to see what the plan is, not until the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| My name is Megan Howard, 4921 Wise Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I also am adjoining to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| To duplicate everything that's already been said, keeping it brief, it is the rezoning that is our concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| We would like to be able to have a chance to meet with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| I work at a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Kathy does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| My husband's KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| We have contacted Liz with, unfortunately, not directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| This is our first time with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| There are 13 children that adjoin this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| and the rumors of what this property is going to be are the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| We join this property in a boarding facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| A one dwelling per acre does not keep the integrity of any of the zoning around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| We do have neighborhoods down Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| Don't want to repeat everything that Kathy said, but that is our concern, is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| We would like an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| There just seems to be too many questions about what this could be in the area that we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| and those are rumors that we would not know until the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| But that is our concern now, is the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| So we would request a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| And I do want to just address your concerns about what this may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| What is before us right now is rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| It is not what can be or could be on the property, but what is the zoning for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3389)|
| 0:56:41| Mr. Green, could you address that a little bit further about how, I mean, we do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| it's not our job to say what is going to go on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| I think there's another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| There is one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I'm sorry, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I believe on the application it said potential boarding home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| That is on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| So we don't understand what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| That's correct, and that's among the uses permitted in the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| The current, the boarding home is among the uses permitted under the planned residential zoning that they're desiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| One question or issue that's come up is the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| The current agricultural zoning allows one acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| What the planned residential would do at a lot area of one acre would be to allow clustering of the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| but no greater number of units than permitted basically under the current agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| There are uses permitted under the planned residential that may not be permitted under the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| As Chair Toker mentioned, the planned residential does require a concept plan to be presented to this commission for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3469)|
| 0:57:57| at a public hearing with public notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| So the planned use would come back to this commission for review and approval following any rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| We would be interested in the PERC test information just because we all passed PERC tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| but we've all still had major issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| And some of the, as part of some of the planned review for any proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| the provision of services like water and sewer would be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| Ma'am, I think you also wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| You're good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Mr. Mullins, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3519)|
| 0:58:47| Ma'am, can you come to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3527)|
| 0:58:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Sir, I don't think some of my members heard exactly what you said the boarding home was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| I apologize, but they asked that that be repeated, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| All I said was that a boarding home is one of the uses permitted under the proposed zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| and I'll have to look up the definition and get that to you in a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Oh, Ms. Albertson has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| In the general term section under Article 2 of the zoning ordinance, it lists a lot of uses and definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3559)|
| 0:59:28| The one that we're discussing today, I believe, is called boarding home for sheltered care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3568)|
| 0:59:36| I believe Mr. Mullins will be able to speak to that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| And a boarding home for sheltered care is defined as a profit or nonprofit boarding home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| rest home, or other licensed by the appropriate governmental agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| which in addition to providing food and shelter to three but not more than 12 persons unrelated to the proprietor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3589)|
| 0:59:56| also provides any personal care or service beyond food, shelter, and laundry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Such services may include, one, supervision and assistance in dressing, bathing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| and maintenance of good personal hygiene, two, care in emergencies or in temporary illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| usually for periods of one week or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| and three, supervision in the taking of medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| and four, other services conducive to the resident's welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Does that answer your question before we go on to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Sir, we can't hear when you're at the back, but is there something that the applicant is going to be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3630)|
| 1:00:41| She mentioned the word business in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I said it's a profit or nonprofit boarding home, rest home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| or other home licensed by the appropriate governmental agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| So that would be considered a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| I don't think this zoning applies to that, what you're trying to rezone it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| In reality, we don't know what the use of the property will be at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| This is a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Among the uses permitted in the planned residential zoning is the boarding house for sheltered care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| as defined by Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| There are a number of other uses also permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| And one of the challenges of this commission is they have to consider all uses that could be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| under a proposed zoning, not a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| The next step in this is if the rezoning is approved would be a concept plan where the use is identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3693)|
| 1:01:42| and then this commission could determine if that particular use is appropriate on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| But we'll find out a lot more when the applicant gets to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| I want to know what it is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| So let's let him, when we get to him, we'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| Unfortunately, the clock never continued going, so I think that we probably heard more than 10 minutes from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| But Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| At this stage, I'm here on behalf of the owners of the property, Mr. Jones and Mr. Owsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| They are the current owners of the property, and this property has been for sale for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| There has been interest in looking at it for a residential treatment facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| which I understand under the county ordinance would fall within the definitions that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| That is not assured that's going to be the ultimate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| There would have to be a lot of due diligence that goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| That is one potential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| The owners wanted to go ahead and rezone it to planned residential at the one dwelling unit per acre density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| to increase the marketability of this property in case that use does not come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| So that's why we are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| But I understand what some of the concerns are, and I think we can address some of them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| And as mentioned by Mr. Green, you know, this is going to be a planned use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| There's going to be more conversations in the future about whatever goes in there, which is the point of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| It's currently zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Agricultural allows the same use that they are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| It doesn't allow the same flexibility in the design that they're concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| And so by moving this to a planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| it allows this body to have a say-so in the design that ultimately comes before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| There's not been any engineering done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| That's too soon at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| If there's environmental concerns, if there's, you know, there will be phase ones, there will be geotech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| All that comes after the fact when it comes into the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| But if they're concerned about the use, that use is already allowed in the zone where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| By moving it to PR, we're not trying to increase the density other than what's allowed there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| Right now, they can develop 42 dwelling units on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| The problem with this property is, one, it's up against the detention facility property to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| That impacts its marketability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| There's also, it's an odd-shaped lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| And as you get to the south, as you come down away from the wide area where the pond is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| that's in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| So, you know, there's some design challenges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| By going to PR, whatever ultimate use goes into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| it would allow cluster development there where the slaughterhouse and where the existing road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| and to be concentrated in that area, which, incidentally, is away from the neighbors as far as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3880)|
| 1:04:48| Again, we'll have to come back here with a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| We will be glad to have conversations with the neighbors as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| You know, I received one email from the neighbor that was asking about the potential benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| I responded to that email directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| I read the email that I believe Ms. Payne sent to Liz, which was attached on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| I did not reach out to Ms. Payne directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| I didn't see that until yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| But, you know, that was the only email that I saw in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| You know, right now, we don't know what the end use will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| That is a potential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| There has been interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| And so we can talk about that more if there's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| But this zoning is only in the best interest not only of the property owner but the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| because it allows there to be more flexibility, allows us to actually address their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| instead of trying to, you know, stick with the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| which would limit the tools that this body has and the developer may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| in ultimately building out this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| So we would ask that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| And I assure you that if I'm involved in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| we will have communications with the neighbor about the ultimate use and their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| And even if you're not, you're going to suggest to whoever is involved to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| And just to clarify, any kind of PERT testing that is done at the design phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| There's going to have to be sewer run to the property for what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| And there's no guarantee that that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| So that's another potential issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| So, I mean, even if we get this rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| we don't know what ultimately could go there until we kind of go through more of the due diligence steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| I think that answers my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| When I first saw this rezoning one dwelling unit to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| it was confusing because agricultural permits one house per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| I mean, you can do it without changing the zoning at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| But agenda review has explained that it's a planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| which means that the lots don't have to be one full acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| but you can't have any more than 42 houses on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| And to me, when they brought that up, I thought, well, that helps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| because the neighbors around are farms and bigger tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| It helps you plan your development within the confines and gives you more buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| and gives you more ability to do a better job of putting a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| If you assume that somebody is going to build houses on that at some point, that's as good as it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| A planned review before this board helps us find out what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| I just think I understand why they're applying for the PR planned residential at one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4065)|
| 1:07:53| That's really, really low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| They're going to have to have sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| It won't be approved with septic tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| We just don't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| So I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR planned residential zoning with up to one dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| to approve PR zoning up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| We also have a lot more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| That's my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Was that your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Yeah, I turned it on and turned it off again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| No, I agree with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| The property being located next to the detention center, some of the topographic constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| I think it really is in the best interest of the neighborhood to move forward with planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| I think at the one acre maximum density, that's relevant and important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| So that's why I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| It's 42 acres, one unit per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| Is there a distinction between is it 42 lots or could it be a building with 42 residence apartments in one building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4148)|
| 1:09:18| Or how does that density correspond to a boarding house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| I mean, do you anticipate individual homes or one big building with residential living facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| Ms. Albertson, you can say what is allowed and Mr. Mullins can say what he envisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| So under permitted uses, the following dwelling units are permitted in the PR residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| Houses and attached houses, not including mobile homes, duplexes, multi-dwelling structures, and developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4182)|
| 1:09:51| And Mr. Mullins, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| I'd also point out just in the definition of boarding home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| there is a restriction in the number of individuals that can be under one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| I mean, it talks about no more than 12 persons unrelated to the proprietor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| So there are limitations to that that, again, would need to be designed around at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| that we would have to come back to this body and talk about if that is the ultimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| I'm just trying to give the residents there kind of a picture of what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| And I'm kind of confused myself with regard to density versus a multi-occupant building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| And based on the listing of types of dwelling units read by Ms. Albertson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4234)|
| 1:10:42| it could be 42 individual dwelling units or it could be one building with 42 dwelling units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| That's the permissiveness of the planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| It allows that range of dwelling types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Again, keep in mind that they are not mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| You're limited to 12 people unrelated in one structure, in one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| So potential 504 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| Keep in mind that the plan has to come before this mission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| And the residents will have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| When there's a plan made, they will have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| They'll be able to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| And I would encourage Mr. Mullins to follow the advice of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| in meeting with the neighborhood before, if the rezoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| prior to bringing the plan before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| Commissioner Hill, I thought I saw your light on, or was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I just wanted to add that I think the advantage of planned residential is it allows the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| to stay out of the hillside and steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Keeping that as undisturbed property, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| And we'll see this when the concept plan comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| It allows the dwelling units to be concentrated on the flattest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| most buildable part of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| And Commissioner Graff, I saw your light on, and now it's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| We do have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| and a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| And I'm assuming that you folks have already exchanged phone numbers or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| I will get with them and talk to them out in the hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Okay, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| And we look forward to seeing you back here when your concept plan is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| We are moving on to agenda item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| This is going to take three motions and three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| This is a subdivision report, concept use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| The subdivision is Rainier Valley, formerly Autumn Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Applicant developer is North Shore Construction, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| The location is the north side of East Emery Road, northeast of Palmyra Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Approximate acreage is 3.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| And the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| The number of lots is 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| There are two variances required and one requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4414)|
| 1:13:44| Staff recommendation is to approve variances one and two and waivers one because topographic constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| and site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| Second is also to approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| And then the third is to approve the request for up to 16 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| and a reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Sir, have you already written down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Bobby Joe Albright, 4813 East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Is that also on the list there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| As a kid, I farmed this whole area here, and I know that there's a solid bedrock in the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| There's some huge outcroppings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| My request is that we prevent them from blasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| because it's going to burst all the foundations in the houses around there if they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4500)|
| 1:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Is there some way that we can prevent them from blasting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| What we'll do is we'll hear from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| We wanted to hear what your opposition is, and let's hear if the applicant addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| My opposition is that they be prevented from doing any blasting in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| What we'll do is we'll hear from the applicant, and then we'll go to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| and we'll discuss further, but we've got that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| And, ma'am, was yours the same, or did you have something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| My name is Sherry Roop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| What was your last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Roop, R-O-O-P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| I live at 7600 Old Maynardville Pike, which is the property behind the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| My place is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| The way the development would sit is the highest point would be at Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| and it would slope back toward my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| So my primary concern is the water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| I've already had some issues with another development that was connected years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4578)|
| 1:16:26| and so I'm just worried about how much water my property can actually handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| I called both the engineer and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| and on their design is a drain system that goes into a stormwater pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4596)|
| 1:16:46| and I understand that that will slow the flow of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| However, to me, the way it is designed, there is very little green space left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| which would increase the volume tremendously of the amount of water that would be coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| I'm also concerned, as Mr. Albright mentioned, about any blasting because it is a very rocky area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| and the setbacks being narrowed, I mean, that also reduces the green space and reduces privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4634)|
| 1:17:29| I would prefer to be able to work all these things out now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| than have to deal with potentially 16 neighbors later if we're having issues with runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| or a pond that smells bad or isn't working properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| So on my property, I have my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| I have a business and a rental home that a dear friend lives in, and so that's my future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| I'm going to hope to be there for a long time and retire with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| So I'm very concerned about long-term effects of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| So your property is right there to the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| My house is the building to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| The building kind of shaped like a T would be the kennel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| and then beyond that there is the rental house, which sits at the lowest point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| which is where I assume the pond would drain into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| My property is relatively flat as you go toward the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| so incidences like this week's flooding, it's kind of exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| Oh, yes, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| And the problem I'm having with the other development is it has caused parts of our pasture to stay wet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| and then when we get flooding like we've had, there's nowhere for the water to absorb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| and I'm afraid with more development that's going to create an even larger piece of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| that's going to stay wet all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| So we're struggling with keeping the driveway intact and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| Are you familiar with the county stormwater ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Not very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| I would like the county engineering to just kind of explain a little bit what the ordinance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4753)|
| 1:19:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| The engineer would have to calculate pre-development flow rates for a range of storms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| between the one-year storm and the hundred-year storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| which is 2.5 inches is the one year and 6.5 is the hundred year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| You have to calculate the peak flow rates, and those flow rates couldn't be exceeded after development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| What I'm asking for today is I'm not completely opposed to the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| but I'd like to ask for a postponement so some of these things can be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| and, you know, I can look at options for my property as well as what might be happening next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| I'm wondering if fewer houses and more green space might be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| So basically I'm asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Let's hear from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| This is Garrett Tucker, 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| Yeah, I spoke with Ms. Rupp earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| We spoke a couple times and share her concerns and certainly understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| and, you know, if I was in her shoes, I would be very concerned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| The property, you know, there is quite a bit of green space left on this because we can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| the property's wide enough to get units on both sides of the road, which you normally like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| So we tried to split that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| We can, you know, give her more of a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| We asked for a 25-foot peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| We would like to keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Most of the units now are 30 feet or more from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| It's just that when you get to the cul-de-sac area that you can't, that we possibly can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| we'll need the setback reduction because this cul-de-sac takes up so much room that you couldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| we'll need to be closer to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| So, and, you know, this is a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| so we still have a lot of work to do on the drainage part of it to make sure that we are balancing the flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| It's a little bit of a, we do have some extra green space that I'm thinking we might try to do some infiltration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4893)|
| 1:21:41| that kind of stuff to really try to minimize, you know, reduce those flow rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| and not exceed what the stormwater ordinance requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| We can also do some plantings of some trees along the property line with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| because, you know, I do understand she's got a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| She has a kennel, and, you know, I think even when we're out there doing a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| I'm going to warn our surveyors to not do anything that might upset the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| So, I don't see any really need to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| I mean, a lot of this stuff has to be worked out during the design stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| and we will certainly work with her and, of course, the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| I know that other subdivision, I found out a little bit more about it, Emory Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| It was done, like, 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| A lot has changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| The stormwater ordinance is a whole lot more, and I understand they did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| there's not even a pond on that subdivision for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| It was filled in or was never done, and so I'm sure she is having some problems from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| I thought, you know, maybe the county might look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| or we might look at it with her and see if there's anything that can be done on her property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| to help solve the drainage problem that she's already having from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| We would just ask to get approved at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Could you address Mr. Albright's concern about blasting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| Oh, yeah, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| I mean, I noticed some rock outcroppings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| He's had a geotechnicals, some drilling done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| I mean, some of the holes went as deep as 15 feet, so it's not everywhere on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| We would not need to, we would avoid blasting at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| because one thing, it's going to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| So I think we're going to, we can commit to not doing any blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| So you can commit to doing no blasting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Did you hear that, Mr. Albright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| Mr. Tucker said he can commit to doing no blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| So that addresses your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I think the concept plan is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| and I'm going to make a motion to approve variances 1 and 2 and waivers 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| because topographic constraints and site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| a second by Commissioner Crowder to approve variances 1 and 2 and waivers 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| We do have a few more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| We're going to go to Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Yeah, I just have a question of staff, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| On a 20-foot, when you reduce your street down to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| is it required that it be a private road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| I'm going to refer that to engineering, because their standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| You could ask for a variance on a public road down to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| but I doubt that we would approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| So that's why we see it's a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| But still, I don't quite understand that reasoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| because it's still built to Knox County standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| You still inspect it, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| If there's more than five lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| it has to meet public road standards relative to pavement depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| So we do the inspection to make sure that they put enough stone binder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| and surface on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| But you don't want to be responsible for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| I don't know who to address this to, but is blasting not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| do you not have to have a permit to blast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| And isn't it regulated to some degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| I don't know the law exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| but I know that there are distance regulations relative to existing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Yeah, and you have to have a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| and it's usually cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| But I understand your concerns, Mr. Albright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| and it's on the record where he says they're not going to blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| But I think if he does blast, he's going to have to get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| and you can, at that point, the Knox County, I don't guess it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| It's a state permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| and I believe you have to do a pre-blast survey of the surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| There will be a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| You'll get a big, long record of it before it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| Thank you for that education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| I did not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| I do not see any more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| We do have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5191)|

| 1:27:12| subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5232)|

| 1:27:28| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| And, Mr. Tucker, I was impressed by something that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Mr. Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| I was very impressed with something that you said that suggests that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| perhaps you could work with engineering to look at the other development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| that was developed and perhaps look at how to keep up some of the storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I was very impressed with that and hope you follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| We are on to agenda number 18, which was pulled off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5284)|
| 1:28:09| So those of you that are looking on your tablets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| you may have to go to a different place to look for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| This is a concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| The subdivision is Windsor Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| The applicant developer is Scott Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| The location is west side of Fretz Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| north side of Hatmaker Lane, north of I-40-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| Approximate acreage is 12.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| The proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| Number of lots is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Are three subdivision variances required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| The staff recommendation is to approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| because topographic constraints and site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| Also, second vote is to approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5354)|
| 1:29:23| And a third motion and vote will be to approve the request for up to 128 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| and a reduction of the peripheral setback to 20 feet for lots 113, 114,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| and 25 feet for lots 127 or for lot 127 subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5378)|
| 1:29:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| Mr. Davis, would you like to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| My name is George Martz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| I live at 12024 Woodhollow Lane, which is just to the north of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| I purchased this house, and two days later they began work on this subdivision under the direction of a previous developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5409)|
| 1:30:18| who I believe sold it to whoever is working on the property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| My main and only concern is centers, and I've heard some very nice terms here, hillside protection and slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5423)|
| 1:30:37| That subdivision varies the line between ours, Brandywine, and the forest, Windsor Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5437)|
| 1:30:46| varies from maybe level to as much as a 20-foot difference between the height of the Windsor Forest and Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5446)|
| 1:30:59| And I assume there was some ruling about how much height and how much depth a hill can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| so that there's enough mass and force to keep the higher property in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| and hence the term hillside protection and slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| Somebody decided that they were going to come along and shave away at the existing hill that had been there pretty much forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5478)|
| 1:31:27| and less than two months later, the wall and the hillside has caved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5487)|
| 1:31:37| This is in the property that are two adjacent to me, 120-16 and 120-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5497)|
| 1:31:45| My property has not blew through, but it certainly shows strain in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| So that's my concern, is that if we can address to make sure that we adhere to proper and safe hillside protection and slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5513)|
| 1:32:06| then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| The property we don't have an issue with, I don't have an issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| And the area that you're referencing, that's on the subdivision that has already been built on Wood Hollow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| is that where you're talking about that there's been some issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| See, it's at the very entrance of the Wood Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| And on the south side of those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| And I have pictures if you're interested in seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| Do you have them printed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| I have them on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| I mean, I can show them to somebody if they wanted me to send them to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| I can e-mail them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| I mean, I understand that there is potentially some agreement that something's wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| but I just wanted to make sure I brought that to people's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| Is the county aware of issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| Yeah, I just became aware of it today at the meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| It sounds like, though, it's Brandywine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| the failures coming from Brandywine falling onto Mr. Davis' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Well, what happened is they shaved the bottom of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| So now you take away weight and mass that keeps the hill in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| There's a retaining wall there that has been in place for seven, nine years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| something like this, and two months after they shaved that hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| that retaining wall blew out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| I know when the original development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| we didn't have a retaining wall on the plans for Brandywine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| I'm not sure whether the builders put that in as part of the building permit, or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| I bought this house about a year and a half ago, so I don't really know the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| The design plans for Brandywine subdivision had a slope going down between Brandywine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| and down onto this before it was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| Yes, and it was, in my opinion, it was completely fine until somebody decided to shave away at the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| We moved a lot of the trees and stuff, but, I mean, that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| It sounds like where you're talking about is right at the very north side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| that we're going to be discussing, so perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Is that correct, right there at the blue line there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Okay, then perhaps Mr. Davis can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Where you're speaking about, that green hashed area, yes, but I think it also, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| they shaved that hill from all the way down, I mean, I can't tell you exactly how far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| but at least 12, 15 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| Now, I don't know why anybody would approve when you talk about slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| and you talk about hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| I don't know who would think that would be a smart idea to come back and shave a hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| so it has more slope and less mass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| That is a different development, though, than what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Part of it is what you're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Right, which I think that it's good for a county to be hearing about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| but I'd like to hear Mr. Davis talk about the part that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| and because what you're talking about is part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| I think that it's critical that you brought that information to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| I'd like to hear from Mr. Davis now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5759)|

| 1:36:08| We are aware of what the gentleman is speaking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| and our staff has met with Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| and Mr. Elliott out on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| and it is from Brandywine coming down on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| Ours is cut, and it was all done cut to engineering specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| and I think there was a retaining wall built up there that was built without a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I don't want to say something that's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| And that has now come down on us with all the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| And so I spoke with Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| I told him we would come in and help clean that up and address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| even though it was there coming down on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| but we'll get it addressed and cleaned up and rematted and cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| And actually what we're discussing today is a little bit further south of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| on a small piece that we acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| and just adding on a small piece to the existing subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| and adding one little section there about two acres onto the existing subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| In reality, the only part that you are going to be able to have any control over fixing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| of that retaining wall is the part that is in the area we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| the hashed green area, the part to the west of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| Yes, ma'am, but we work with the builder there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| and we're all trying to work together to make sure everything's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| And the county engineering department is great to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| so if we can help them, we try to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| and we all work together to try to clean up messes when they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Well, that's good to hear. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| I don't see any lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5864)|

| 1:39:19| And it sounds like Mr. Davis is doing some good work with the other developer to fix that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| I only have one other request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| and that would be that if the engineering department could go look at this existing slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| and make sure that it's within the standards of what's code, I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| It sounds like engineering has made note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Our development services have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200213?start=5987)|
