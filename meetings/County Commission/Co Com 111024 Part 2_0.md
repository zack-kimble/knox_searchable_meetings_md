| 0:00:00| A lot of fun over on this side. Don't you miss us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:02| I'm going to be joining in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2)|
| 0:00:06| I'm going to have to have me a little something, something under the table over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=6)|
| 0:00:13| No fair looking under the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:16| You'll be at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:28| Let's go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=28)|
| 0:00:29| It is 436.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=29)|
| 0:00:31| Clerk, first ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| It's on page 8, ordinance 0-11-10-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| It is amending Knox County Code section 2-31 entitled districts to establish the county commission districts for the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=40)|
| 0:00:48| This amends ordinance 0-91-11-104 adopted December 16th, 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Ordinance 0-01-7-103 adopted August 27th, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| And ordinance 0-09-8-103 adopted September 28th, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=67)|
| 0:01:09| For those watching, this is the section where we are looking at just county commission districts only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| We have a separate ordinance which would look at just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| No, we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Well, Mr. Jarrett, as we look at the motion, someone will need to make a motion for a specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| That's the way you've crafted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| So let's get a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Does someone like to make a motion on one of the plans, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| Or Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| No, I don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| I want to ask Tim some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Is there a motion that we would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to approve Plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| Motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Tim, Mr. Coon, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| And I know you may not have the numbers right in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Can you tell me what the 40 and 42, can you tell me exactly how many are in each of those two precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=116)|
| 0:02:05| the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| I didn't look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| This weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=135)|
| 0:02:24| Forty and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Tim Coon, I'm a GIS manager for the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| Precinct 40, Norwood, 2,931 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| 2,931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Precinct 42, Pleasant Ridge, 3,818 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| Total population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Can you, if you put one of those in the second district and one of those in the third district and withdrew it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:56| you knew I was going to ask that, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| If you put one of those in the third district and one of those in the fourth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| and withdrew it from the sixth district, what would the deviations be on those three districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:13| We'd have to do some napkin math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| I mean, I don't do math publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| I learned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| We can scratch some, do some napkin math if you want and try to see what that would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| I mean, 1A is that plan there, it stretches the sixth district into Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| And I understand what it's doing and I understand the thought process behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| and the reasons why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| But it stretches that district all the way from Watt Road, Buttermilk Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| or Watt Road and 40 into Norwood and Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| And I just think that the geography is not, the communities are totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| The geography is extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| And if we're going to approve Plan 1A and we're going to look at 1A, I just think it's unfair for the same people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| Solway and Hardin Valley West, to be represented by the same commissioner that's representing 40 and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| And if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Can you describe that one more time, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| I'd like to take 40, or what the numbers would be, to take 40 and put it in District 2 and 42 into District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:31| What would that do to their deviation and mine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Because I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| We used to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| I had a deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| I don't know exactly where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Well, the District 6 deviation is current under Plan 1A is .66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| So the ideal population, total population is 48,025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| Total population under Plan 1A is 48,343.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| So we'd be looking at pulling out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| I didn't scratch down those numbers when I said it, but it was what was the total for those two precincts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| Roughly 3,000 and 3,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| 3,000 and 3,800?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| So are we talking about 6,000, 7,000 people out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| We'd be starting to have to look at some other additional moves to add some population back into the 6th District, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| by that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Just kind of without looking at it too closely, taking 6,000 people out is probably going to put you over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| That district under this plan is at .66 over the ideal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| So by taking out that much population, we're going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| I've already got 65 north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| It's already mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I got it in the last reapportionment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| I saw that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| We're going to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I think it's safe to say we're going to go through the floor in terms of the overall rate, the deviation for your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| So we'd have to look at adding some population back in from another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| And that's where it starts getting hard to do this on the fly because this can literally ripple through the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=365)|
| 0:06:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Brad, what was those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| They were what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Forty was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Forty is 2931 and 42 is 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I mean, what would you call them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| One of them is Norwood and one of them is Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| I just, if we're going to vote on 1A, I will be voting no and would rather have 2A than 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| 2A is the least of the evils for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| I'll be glad to withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| You know, I mean, 1A and 2A, I mean, just for me personally or whatever, is exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| So I just said 1A to get things started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| But I would be glad to withdraw it rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| I'll withdraw 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| So it's withdrawn and second agree to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Do we have another motion or a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Motion is made for 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Motion has been made and seconded on 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| Tim, on 2A, does this align the school board and the commission districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| The question of alignment between the school board and county commission is really a question of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| or not the same plan is adopted for both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| If plan 2A was adopted for commission and plan 2A is adopted for school board, you would have aligned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| If you choose differing, you know, a different plan for school board, the districts would not be, you know, in alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| School board picked 3A, though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| I think you crossed onto the idea that I believe we probably need to be discussing before we picked on one plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| First, I'd like to say that I appreciate the leadership given by Board Education Lynn Huguett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:07| and fellow Commissioner Larry Smith in their months, weeks of committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| along with the GIS folks and everybody that's got the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| I attended those meetings or some of them, although I was not a member of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| just to make sure that I understood what was taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| One of the things that I got out of it was the fact that four of the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| Board Education and Commission, four of them, on all four plans are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| Eighth, ninth, first, and fourth, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Am I right in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| Eight, nine, one, and four are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| I also heard in those committee meetings that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| the election commissioner said that he would like to see the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| and the commission districts be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| It makes it cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| It makes it easier, less training if when you go into a place, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| it's the same district for school board or county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| It makes it easier on the person going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| I think there are other things that came up along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| I think that the committee worked on trying to keep communities unified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| That was one of their three-star things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| They did not want to divide up communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| So we've got to stay, I think, with, you know, one, two, three, or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| One of the things I think that was asked for is that Farragut stay together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| I believe Dr. Briggs is looking at the two plans that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| I believe a couple of people on school board even said that the commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| and the school board districts should look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| Community, whatever it is, the state arm of assisting counties in how to go about doing your work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| as an extension of the state recommends that the commission districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| and the school board districts look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| That's a CTAS that's recommending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| One of the things that we're doing here deals with the census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| and we have no control over where people moved into or moved to or from within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| We just go every ten years and find out where the people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| and then try to make the districts all have the same number of people in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| and a few other constraints that this committee has, they've met what they're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=655)|
| 0:11:05| I think where I leave out of that is that where does the incumbent sit now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| Well, we didn't have any control over where people moved to or live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| but we do have a requirement to make districts for them so that they have one person, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| I believe that where the incumbent may be right now is covered in some rules like the next election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| or after the next election or stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| But the most important thing, although I may have picked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| or selected one particular plan over another as I think it would be best for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| I think the best thing for us to do is decide whether or not we can go with the districts look the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=705)|
| 0:11:52| and I believe that's the direction that we should go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| And so now if we want to back up and look at how should commission be aligned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| because I don't really care whether we go with the school board's alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| or whether we go with the commission alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| You know, the rest of the counties already decided that for the 8th, 9th, 1st, and 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| They're already congruent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| I would like to see the commission sit here today and make the difficult choice, whatever that might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| to one of those plans being acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| And so it pushes a little bit on this person or that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| That would then, to me, make it look like it's a good plan if we can come up with aligning the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| and the commission because that's what lots of people say we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Brad, while we're looking at this, you might be thinking, could you do away with just one of them, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| and maybe take out 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| You might want to look at that, if that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| I'm not trying to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I'm trying to help the community representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| You know, the issues that are in Hardin Valley and Solway are not the same issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| You know, the district six is being the fastest growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| It's the most developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| Districts 40 and 42 have different needs and different established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| And the rest of this district is establishing itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| And I think that to put those two together unfortunately had to be done by numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| I don't think it was done out of spite or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| I just think it's a bad move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Just want to remind the commissioners, too, and I think Dave just alluded on it a little bit, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| is I received several e-mails over the last week about trying to keep the Powell and the Halls community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| And that seemed to be all the e-mails that we got was from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| And I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| And what I noticed, they were everyone from Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| The people from Powell wanted to have thought that they had more of an alignment with the Halls community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| And, Mr. Chairman, before we get too much into discussion, you know, I'd like to maybe hear from Cliff Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| He had a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| I think the League of Women Voters had some things that they wanted to say at the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| But they've got some important information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| I don't know if it would be the appropriate time now to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Sure. Mr. Rogers, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| I'm Cliff Rogers, Administrator of Elections 300 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And I'm going to make my remarks a little briefer because Commissioner Wright went over one of the main,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| I guess you'd say, principles that I had when I got together with you all before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And that is I did want to see the school board and the county commissions aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| And there were several reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| And Commissioner Wright pointed those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| One of those had to do with saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| We do spend a lot of time educating our election officials about polling place procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| to ensure that every voter gets the proper ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| And every ballot combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| and district line and additional bit of information and complexity increases the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| and money it takes us to train our election officials to do their job properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| And the less money we have to spend on training, the more money we'll save the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| And when procedures are unnecessarily complex, it costs money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| So that was one of the main things that I had emphasized at the redistricting committee when I was invited to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=932)|
| 0:15:40| I still think, too, that when you align them, it will also serve the public because you'll be putting those districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| together where those voters will have one commissioner and one school board member representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| It's about putting people first, not politics, in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| I also pointed out that what I was suggesting and others have suggested is not a novel concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| Hamilton County aligns the commission and the school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| Sixty of the 64 counties that we surveyed also do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| And the few that do not have both a city and a county school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| These other counties align the district boundaries because it's simple and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| Now, what I want to emphasize to you all today, that's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| That's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| But what I really need is for you all to make a decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| It's going to have to be soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| State law requires district boundaries, as you know, to be redrawn by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| More critically, we have four district school board races on the ballot next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| That's school board districts two, three, five, and eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| In a typical election year, those candidates for these offices would already be picking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| and filing their nominating petitions to run for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| However, because the new school board boundary lines have yet to be established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| Tennessee law prevents us from issuing those petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| The qualifying deadline is presently set for noon on December the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| I discussed this deadline with the state today, and it is set in stone unless there is court intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| And I know that I don't want that and nobody here wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| That's the only way that the deadline can be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| And keep in mind, as I understand it, you all have a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| You all have got to come up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| And at some point, there will be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| And those deadlines get closer and closer to that December the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| A date that had been thrown out there was November the 21st for the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| That deadline, if that's it, is simply two and a half weeks before the qualifying deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| And I also found out from talking with the state today that we've got to have maps drawn up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| at least something on our wall, something out there on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| something so that the candidates know which district they will be able to get those registered voters to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| So the deadline is becoming quite critical, and I can't really overemphasize that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| That's one of the main things, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| With regards to that, after we have voted, we are looking at having a special call meeting to vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| I have dates that we can discuss, but I think the first step is to get something passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I don't know if the League of Women Voters for Virginia, did you want to say something real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| And also, while she's coming there, I want to really thank what Tim did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Tim did an outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| If his boss is here, he needs a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| This guy did really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| He's going to get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Again, I've spoken to you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| The League agrees with our election commissioner, our election supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| that it's going to make it simpler for the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| And, yes, it will involve, you know, moving voters, and it's not extremely, you know, clean or I guess that's not the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:34| But it will involve people moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| And there are, you know, it does involve a little bit of extra, you know, confusion at this point right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:50| But over the long term, when we know our population is going to grow, you know, one of our points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| Mr. Rogers made some great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| But just the point is that if we wait, our population is only going to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| There's going to be more people displaced ten years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| It makes more sense to do it, to go ahead and try to align now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| So we support trying to make, you know, going ahead and making this simpler for the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| and reducing the confusion over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Mr. Coon, I just had a question, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| One, in Plan 1A, when we were looking at 1A there, and this is probably maybe an irrelevant question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:46| but for the Norwood and Pleasant Ridge communities, was there discussion of leaving that in District 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:57| Why couldn't we have left those in District 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Is that just purely a population issue, just for equity and population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| Those communities fit together, Norwood, Pleasant Ridge, 43, 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| Those are communities that really, you know, all those people know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| And so that was curiosity to me about 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| And then my other question is, which one is 2A, I mean, in 2A is the commissioner from District 3 is the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:44| that's displaced, right, and moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| From the commission side, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| From the commission side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Okay, so I'd be the only one that's displaced in 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Everybody else stays within their commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Only in 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| But to the first question, was that discussed about Norwood and Pleasant Ridge and remaining in District 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:13| Sometimes it's kind of hard to, it depends on where you start looking at this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| So if we were to isolate just District 6 and thinking about why Norwood and Pleasant Ridge are in District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| District 6 I think, I don't have the numbers, I have them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| but it grew on the order of 15,000 people over the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| The ideal population for each district grew by about 7,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| So the net result for District 6 is that it needed to lose about 7,000 people based on the population growth that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| So as far as the rationale, Plan 1A, really its basis for it was to take, not start at District 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:58| it was really to start at District 2 and to look at the Fountain City area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| and to move Fountain City entirely into the second district, Fountain City and Shannondale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| In doing that, that means that you have to take, you also put Powell, then you put Powell into District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| So you're taking some population out of the second, out of the seventh district, putting it into the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| So that's what happens to Shannondale, Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| That's precincts 34, 35, 36, and 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| So then Powell is taken out of the sixth district, that's precinct 73, along with several dainty precincts, 72W and 72M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| That helps bring the district, you're taking that out of District 6, putting it into District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| So that helps to boost the District 7 population back up for the removal of District, the Shannondale and Fountain City areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:55| So, again, it's kind of a pinwheel that's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| You just kind of start going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| So following the removal of the Powell area from District 6, we need to look for some population to add back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| I think we saw the numbers that it's on the order of about 7,000 people that we're putting back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| So Powell and Dainey areas, we're pulling out of District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| Moving to District 7, we need to put some population back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| So we have to look at what the options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| If you look at the border of District 6, the options are Farragut, which we can't, would be considered probably unwise to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| from the standpoint that we'd be splitting Farragut at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| I think that was a lesson from the 2009 redistricting process is that Farragut was considered a community that needed to stay together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| We could look at Concord North, 65, precinct 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Cedar Bluff is a huge precinct, 15,000 people in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| So that's not the type of thing we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| So we just kind of go on down a long line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Precinct 55, Lowness, might be a candidate, except it provides contiguity to the other precincts that are further to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| It provides a, you know, commission districts have to be contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| They have to be made up of one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| And so taking something like Cedar Bluff or Lowness, which is 55, out, or even, you know, 44, any of these, breaks the contiguity of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:21| So you really only have a few choices when it all really comes down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And 40 and 42 provide roughly about the right population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| So it really comes down to population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Commissioner Norman, can I ask a question on top of his answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Tim, you said you started with Shannondale and Fountain City, yet they didn't grow any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| Why did you start there and not with District 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Because here's what we could have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| You know, we talked about North Cedar Bluff and Cedar Bluff being a huge district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| You didn't mind to split Amherst in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Why didn't you split Cedar Bluff in half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| You know, why did you start in Shannondale and Fountain City whenever the district that's going to change the most is the 6th district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| The reason that we didn't start in, that we started there is because we worked with the guidance that we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| And so the guidance that we were given from the redistricting committee was to, was essentially four principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| And those four principles were to make sure the boundaries withstand a legal challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| to ensure that there's a high school in each district, to minimize the impact of change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| and to keep the neighborhoods and communities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| What we didn't receive was any specific guidance from the redistricting committee was about where these communities belonged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| So we didn't get guidance that said Fountain City should be, you know, Fountain City right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| and Shannondale is entirely within the 7th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| We didn't get any guidance that it needed to stay there or that it needed to be moved to a new district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| We didn't get any guidance from the committee at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| So it was essentially left to us to come up with some ideas for how we should try to make these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| You don't have to answer anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Well, our solution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| You don't have to answer anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I've heard what I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Mr. Norman, you want to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| So in terms of, like, I completely agree with Brad about 6 and 40 and 42 being in 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:14| So there just was no way in the process of having 40 and 42 in the 3rd district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| I mean, according to how you all are trying to draw this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Just population-wise, there's just no way because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| No, the difference between Plan 1 and Plan 2 and what we were trying to achieve was to give essentially the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| viewpoint with Plan 1 and Plan 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Plan 1 puts Fountain City, Shannondale in the 2nd district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| Plan 2 puts Fountain City, Shannondale in the 7th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| So because we didn't get the guidance as far as where communities belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| we tried to just essentially give the opposite viewpoint from a mapping standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| And so in the case, in the area, you know, in Plan 1, the Norwood areas are kind of where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:10| They're moved to make the districts work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| We don't have a lot of options in terms of the right population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| One of the principles that we work under in doing these plans, and it worked very well in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| was to try to use whole precincts where possible, not to try to split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| The Election Commission did afford us some opportunity in working with large precincts to make a plan work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| and to try to develop some additional alternatives to split a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Amherst was one of those areas that they provided us that option to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:49| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Just echo what Commissioner Wright said and to really emphasize what I heard from our Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1734)|
| 0:29:06| Commissioner Rogers and the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I just think we're at a unique opportunity here to get it right, to get it right at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:17| Are there going to be some bruised egos in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| As Commissioner Wright said, District 1 is the same in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| But I'd point out to you that I don't know if he played for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| but I know Commissioner Anders probably played for Alice Bell Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Those names are synonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Alice Bell Spring Hill was together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| This plan, all four of these plans split Alice Bell out from Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Those two communities feel a, you know, a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| But we're having to make some tough decisions here, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| And if you just drag out the, you know, I was really active in youth athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| You got N. Skip Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah, okay, they're pulled apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Cedar Bluff-Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| We have to make some tough decisions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Some of those decisions are putting people, pulling people apart that's used to being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:23| kind of connected together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| And then I'll also say that the folks in Holston are totally different than the people at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| Folks in Lonsdale are a little different than the people in Spring Hill in terms of their wants, their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| what they want from a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| We manage all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| It's like with our, you know, this is a bad analogy, but, you know, with our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| one of them will come out rambunctious, the other one's calm and quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| So that's kind of our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| We have to take these districts and dig deep and understand what their fears and wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:06| and desires are and try to, to the best of our ability, deliver on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| So I just think as regardless, and, again, all these have first district the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| but I really, really think that when we're done with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| having a single point of contact for educational issues, single point of contact for balance of county issues is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| valuable and we can do something here that 20 years ago said, well, I'm glad they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| That was tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Back in 11, that was a tough, tough call to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| But they made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| And now we're aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Now things, you know, people know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| There's not this ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Well, here I'm the school board here and county commission there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| So I just ask that, you know, regardless what plan we end up on, that we have a plan that is shared by both school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| A lot of good things have been said, but this one plan has been already vetted by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:24| A lot of the work has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| My suggestion would be that we start there, see if we can't agree on something from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| I mean, if we're talking about making them both the same, we're already halfway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| What does it take, you know, to make the two come together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| That would be a proper starting point to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| Commissioner Anders, I want to build on to the side of what Commissioner McKenzie is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| and look at the eighth district, the hills in Fort Sumter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| Fort Sumter Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| In fact, there's some rivalry, I guess you could say, between Gibbs, Corrington-Rita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| or Corrington-Rita-Gibbs, I guess is the way I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Just in those five precincts, there is definitely between Corrington-Rita-Gibbs and Thorn Grove, Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:27| Sunnyview, Door, Kennedy, it's two separate parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| In fact, what happened to us is when commission was reduced in size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| that's a part of the heartburn that was cast upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Even to the point of I'm saying hills in Fort Sumter are halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| Corrington-Rita-Gibbs probably doesn't think there's much in concert with Carter, Thorn Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| Door, Kennedy, or Sunnyview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| But in the redistricting process we just went through, Riverdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| and Ramsey were even talked about being in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| So there's been a lot of thought that's gone into how we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| or how the committee got to where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I mean, they didn't take any of this stuff lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| And although there is a plan in here that I thought I was married to, because of what Commissioner McKenzie is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| because what I think I'm trying to say, let's try to get on the same page of the two elected boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:33| so that they can be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And if nothing else, we can at least then say we're on the same dirty page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| And the next time we can do better about we will all be coming from the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| and try to make it look better at the 10-year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Well, you're trying to make a point about continuity and Hills and Sumter and Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| Well, what they've done here is they talked about not splitting districts and precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| Well, they didn't split North Cedar Bluff, they split Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| And so what if we drew a line that went up between 81 and 80?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Then you'd have a different feeling about all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I believe you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| If we were talking about splitting your precincts and splitting your district, I think we'd have a different attitude about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| And that's exactly what I've just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| I believe that Hills and Fort Sumter are not really that mainstream eighth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| And it's obvious that Rams and Riverdale were not mainstream eighth because they were being offered to move to the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| But what we have before us is a plan, and it's got heartburn in it for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| It doesn't have any heartburn for you because the only thing it does is bring yours, what was south of the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| back to where it should be and north of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| So you have no heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| The heartburn was built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| The plan for the eighth and ninth and first and fourth has been put upon them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| So we need to now look at the rest of the districts somehow getting to being the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| My point is, in 2008, 2009, you lost something that went south that should have never went south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| But it made the numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| See, that's all we were about, and that's all we're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| But we could have made the numbers work by splitting precincts last time, too, but we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| You know, we took the easy way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| But my point is, you know, the district that changed the most, we started farthest away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| And I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| I think I take offense to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| And I don't, you know, we're more worried about, you know, I should be advocating for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| And so why did we start Shenandoah and Fountain City when the district that was affected the most was the sixth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| And we talked about not wanting to split precincts, but we split Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| But we're not going to split North Cedar Bluff to make my district take 40 and 42 out and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| and give me part of North Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| We didn't want to do that because it wasn't easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| We're telling everybody to make hard decisions, but we're not willing to, instead of cutting Amherst in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| cut Cedar Bluff in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| We're not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| You know, you take 1A and you split Pleasant Ridge and Norwood, who have been together and belong together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| It's not even, it's barely contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| And so I do have heartburn with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I think we could have split North Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| It has 15,000 people in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Instead of splitting Amherst, ball camp Amherst, that had 15,000 people in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| So we could have done something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| We just chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| And I take offense that as my district changed the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| that's been considered in the beginning of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Mr. Chairman, a little bit of back history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| You know, Brad, I mean, the meetings were open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I mean, we've been meeting for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Commissioner McKenzie has been at all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Commissioner Owenby, Commissioner Briggs, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Mr. Brown was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Dave Wright has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| You know, we've been working on this for over five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Now, talking about what district started, if you think it was started in the Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| here's what the school board said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| And I think my co-chairman will agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| School board said they want to keep, you know, move the least number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and keep a high school for each of the school board people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| I've said from the commission standpoint, and Tim, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| but I said from the commission standpoint, I want to keep communities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| And by splitting this up, I've got, I had half of Fountain City, half of Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| and a lot of my people that will, the high school and the dining, they all bleeding to the Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| Yes, I'd love to have the hills in Fort Sumter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| And I've tried to twist his arm over here for a long time to get the hills in the Fort Sumter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| But just as Tim said, everything had to move west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| It had to move west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| So, if you do that, look at this, take some of the, the 70th district needed to take some of the Powell area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:44| and cut the line at Fountain City and let the Fountain City, some of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| because instead of having half Fountain City, let somebody else take all of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| But, you know, we've been working on this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| And Tim has been at all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Somebody said, what if we did this, this, and this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| And Tim would come back and give us those emails, that thing, that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| I mean, I spoke with Tim about the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I wasn't on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| I wasn't asked to be on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| And so I didn't feel like it was my place to butt in until the committee had a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| I spoke to Tim and we exchanged emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| We exchanged numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| We exchanged charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| I mean, I've been part of the process, but I haven't been in front of the process because it's not my committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And so this is the vetting of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| And I'm sorry that somebody takes offense to me speaking of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| but I'm not going to become part of the process when I'm, you know, on the front end when it's not my committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| I think, Mr. Chairman, if anybody, now maybe I'm wrong, but you just appointed a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| and it was open to anybody that wanted to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| And we as commissioners, if I'm not on solid waste committee, I won't go to a solid waste meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| We could go and speak our mind about issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| But, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| The motion on the floor is to approve Plan 2A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| Let's do a roll call vote and let's start in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Commissioner McKenzie votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Commissioner Norman votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Commissioner Ombi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Commissioner Ombi votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2420)|

| 0:40:39| Commissioner Schell votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Vote is 6-4 against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| Do we have another motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I would like to move that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| No, that was the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| That was the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I think Commissioner Briggs withdrew his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| I withdrew his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| So do we have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| That is the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Now, Tim, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Could I get another motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Well, that's what I'm about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| The school board has 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| I'd like to move that we adopt 3A, Plan 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Mr. Chairman, I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| And I want to preface it by saying 2A does not give really what we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| 3A does not give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| But it's just like Dave said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| I can work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| And what I like about it, it helps the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| The school board and the commission are on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| And I think that will help Knox County and help the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| I'd just like to note that 3A leaves District 6 after reapportionment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| It leaves them without a live-in representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| And I'd appreciate you not voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| If I may interject just for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I want to be sure I'm clear since I've got to follow up with whatever you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Now, this is 3A, the school board, that you all are voting on at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| No, we're voting on County Commission 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| That's what I was uncertain about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| This is County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Just to get these all out of the way, I'm going to make a substitute motion for Plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| That was the original one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I'm just trying to please people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| So we have a substitute motion for 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| I think that the last statement is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| We're trying to please people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| We're trying to please individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| These are tough calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| And I hate it for the 6th District, but I do think they'll get fair representation over this period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:36| I know that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| They've gotten it and they'll continue to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| The contacts are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| The contacts are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Please don't vote to please people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Please vote to do something that's going to be the best thing for Knox County going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| This is a difficult plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| I did not support this plan in committee because what I wanted to do was support a plan that was more slanted toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| commission in terms of keeping our folks where they needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| But I'm supporting this plan because it's still the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| And we're never going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| It's not going to be 100 percent my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| And we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| A lot of our votes are really, really tight and really, really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| So I guess I would say please don't vote to appease individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| Vote for the plan that's the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| I meant to say to please the people, not these people, but the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| I do want to make a comment about Plan 2A because I feel like I have to sort of defend the people that live out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| Concord District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| Both the Plan 3A and 3B, I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| 3A and 4, I'll vote against both of those because it moves Farragut into the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| Not that that matters one way or another, but you're completely isolating the people that live down in Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| Their kids all go to the Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| And we've talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| And I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| And, you know, there's always going to be, you know, there's always going to be, you know, an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| There's a community called Old Concord that's not part of Farragut, but it is literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| I mean, it's completely surrounded by Farragut that, you know, that won't be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| And I do want to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| I think it would be nice to line the school districts up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| But what I think is more important is because I know after the --if some of you may have experienced this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| after the last redistricting, I had the same people calling me about things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| whether they lived in my district or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| And I don't think they look at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| I said this before, and I'm sort of embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I see it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| I think Concord is 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| I couldn't have told you I was in Precinct 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| I voted today in the state senate race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I wasn't sure, to be honest, if I was number six or number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| I know who my representatives are, and I know who I vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| And I think that that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| And I think when we vote on these things, yeah, it would be nice if we could line the districts up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| But I think it's more important that we do the right thing for the communities we live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| by making the commission districts to fit those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And I think we do the right thing for the children and the families that have children in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| by lining the school district up that best fits the schools best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| And sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| But I have a feeling that just to line these up for something artificial that people really aren't going to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| I hope they vote for me and they don't vote for a number because they sure call me rather than calling a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| But I think that that's what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| And we do have a lot more people that live in the county than just the school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| And those people in those communities need to be represented, I think, in the best fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| The substitute motion is 1A, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| I want to speak a little bit to the 1A and 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| You know, if we're looking at 3A, we all discussed during reapportionment last time about how the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| this is based off the school board plan and we discussed how it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| it kept school communities together but not communities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| And it is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| It makes, we talked about how poorly they were drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| And, you know, if we're going to vote, I would, you know, 1A, although it's not my choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| is the better plan of 3A for commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| And I know there's, Tim, what's the title of 43 and 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| I mean, what neighborhoods are those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| I think it's Westbridge and Bearden Middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Westhaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| Westhaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| And, you know, you look at that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| And, you know, they talked about earlier, they talked about keeping Dante and Powell together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| And 3A just doesn't do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Or 4A doesn't do any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And then 3A splits Dante and Dante and then some of it's in the seventh, some of it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| Some of it's in the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| So if you're going to vote for a plan, I would appreciate a vote for 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:22| So the motion on the floor, the substitute motion is, I'm sorry, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| Hey, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Tell me again the substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| To approve 1A for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| And this is not one that the committee, this is the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| And my understanding was that the joint committee recommended plan 2A, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| 2A and 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| 2A and then the second and the school wanted 3A, but everybody's second choice was 4A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| So how did we get back to 1A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| 2A got voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| And 1A got introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| And this is just the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| So we get to do this again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| No, we get to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Yes, we'll have a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Yeah, I do actually have some concerns with 1A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| and also with 3A in terms of keeping communities and neighborhoods together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:32| I understand the concerns about 72 West and East and 72M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:42| but there's also some concerns within the second district and in the seventh district, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| regarding Fountain City, Aliceville Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2930)|
| 0:49:01| And we didn't discuss those at great length because the committee was recommending plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:09| that didn't really do much to upset those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| So, no, I'm not pleased with plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:30| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| So the motion on the floor, the substitute motion is to approve plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=2975)|

| 0:50:14| Plan 1A for Knox County Commission redistricting has been approved on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| The next item is Ordinance O-11-10-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| It's amending Chapter 2 of the Knox County Code entitled Administration by adding a new Article 13 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| establish the Board of Education Districts for the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| This amends Ordinance O-01-11-101SS adopted November 19, 2001, and Ordinance O-01-12-104 adopted January 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:49| 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Move that Plan 1A be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| The motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Ms. Cindy, could you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| Cindy Buttrey, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| I'm here just watching this and watching what's going on and taking it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| The reason why the school board chose 3A at the end of the day was because it outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| and met all the criteria that the redistricting committee adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| It moves the fewest number of people from our side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| It also keeps communities intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| Norwood especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| That was one of the issues that I did bring up at the redistricting committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| that Plan 3A actually does not split 40 and 41, which would be Norwood Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| and Norwood Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| That was very important to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| I spoke with a number of folks previous to our vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3117)|
| 0:52:03| and they expressed the desire that they wanted to be together because they are the same community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| One of the other issues with 3A that we also talked about was, in addition to Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:19| if depending on how the vote went and how you all voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| you could actually have that community being represented by three different school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| and three different county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| So they would have six total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Forty-one is actually split between the first and, in our case, the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| and the third district, and then 40 would be also in the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| So it was the one that 3A split the fewest number of precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| It only split five out of six when you looked on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| So from our standpoint, this particular plan that we adopted met all of our criteria for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| We did not take into consideration alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| That really wasn't an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| We just looked at it as what met all the criteria that we all had adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| Does 1A not do the same thing for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| 1A significantly changes our districts as they currently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| It actually displaces quite a number of folks from the school board side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| Our numbers are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| In Plan 3A, it only moved, I think, what was it, Tim, 36 or 38,000 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| Thirty-six thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| That was the fewest number on our side, whereas 1A on for us would move, I think, 106,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:54| That means 106,000 people would be voting for different school board members than they currently are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Cindy, before you sit down, you know, this is something that I was alluding to earlier, and it deals with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| I think that what we have to do is to do what's right for the communities and do what's right for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| And the other thing, which is very important also, is to do what's right for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| And I really don't want to, if the school board, and I know you can't speak for them as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| but if the school board says that it's not the best thing to do for the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| and for the children to use the 1A plan, I don't want to vote for that just to line these things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| I know people have talked about good reasons for doing it, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| my sympathies go out to the election commission people that get mixed up to simplify it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| But, you know, we've lived with this system of different districts not lining up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| And the system's worked out pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Maybe it could be a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| I still say that people vote for representatives and not for numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| But do you have a sense as would the school board prefer, you know, like to be lined up at all costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| Or do you think that they would prefer to, would they rather have 1A or would they rather us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| even though they're now going to be split and don't line up, to have their own, which you seem to indicate would be 3A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| I can't speak for the board on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Like I said, we really didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| We talked about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| I think there were some that wanted to align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| No matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| No matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| And then there were others who didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| And the ones that I think would want to align would be the ones that were in 1, 4, 8, and 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| because they didn't change on our side of the street either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| So those four board members, other than looking at the whole of how the rest of us felt on an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:57| it didn't really matter to them one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| So the answer is other than the people that have a personal, I don't want to call it a selfish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| but a personal interest into it, they really don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| I wouldn't say that they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| I just think that it's not as much of a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Because that makes a big difference as to how I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| But I appreciate what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Tim, a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| If we were to do 1A for commission and 3A for the schools, can you kind of give us a thumbnail of how that affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:32| commission districts versus school board districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Do we get back into a commission district may have two school board representatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Well, you don't know because you don't have the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| So I'm just wondering what the impact of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| I mean, it may not matter, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| The only data we provided to the redistricting committee regarding that question was the total number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| the total population that would be aligned within the same district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| So how many people lived in commission district one and school board district one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| commission district six and school board district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Under the current arrangement, 75, about three-quarters of the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| 75.7% of the county's 432,000 residents live in the same commission and school board district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| Going to a 1A, 3A combination, that number is 70.7% or 305,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| 305,000, 665,000 are in the same commission and school board district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| So it would be a slight reduction in the amount of alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I think I've got 83.4, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| Is it not 3A and 1A, 83.4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| It's not 3A, 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| It's 83.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| It's an improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| I was in the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| So 83 point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| In my matrix, excuse me, 360,609.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| So you're saying 83% would continue voting where they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| 83% would be in the same commission and school board district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| We have not actually tabulated the number of commissioners and school board members per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| So we didn't do an analysis like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Cliff, could you come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| I don't know if you know the answer to this or not, Cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| But if we do what we're wanting to do here or what they've talked about, 1A and then you do a 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| What are we talking money-wise to have this split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| I know if we put them together, it's going to be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| It's going to be more cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| And it may be something you'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| I think that it would be about impossible to ascertain at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| But you could know by November, at our November meeting, you would maybe know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| Yeah, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| We've got money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| If you're talking about notifying people and that sort of thing, that money was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| Obviously, this comes up every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| So this is part of the budget, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| But in terms of you're talking about analyzing these two specific plans and how much that's going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| to notify those people that are being moved pursuant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| You were talking about if we combine, you know, commission and school board, it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| it would save your office quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| That was, you know, going to looking at it long-term training because it just simplifies the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| when we're doing all of these training classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| I mean, Commissioner Anders has got four school board districts in his commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| So you've got all kind of combination of ballots in that particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| I'm just giving you one of the more egregious examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| I don't have those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I can't, I don't know that we could actually ascertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Well, I just wanted to mention, too, that I've only got one e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| and I've got a lot of phone calls, go to a lot of meetings, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| And everybody wants us to align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Wherever commission ends, that's where they want to do the school board also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| And, Mr. Law Director, correct me if I'm wrong, we've got the vote, the last vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| In other words, our vote, if school board says they want 3A, but we decided we'll give it 1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| we're the deciding vote, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Under the Tennessee Code, you are the final determinative authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I just, you know, you talk about the citizenships and what the people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| That has been overwhelmingly what the people, wherever you guys end up, put school board in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| A couple of things I want to point out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| One is, and I think I've said this before, I thought that Larry and Lynn did an excellent job co-chairing this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| We had a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| We had a lot of discussion, lots of opportunity for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| And but right now I'm sitting here wondering why did we even go through the process, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| Because we had these maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| We looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| We discussed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| We talked about aligning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| We talked about not aligning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| The entire committee as a whole voted that they liked Plan 2A the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| And there was, there's someone who doesn't like it, who never came to a meeting and never spoke out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| And, yeah, I've got a problem with that, that we've scuttled the work of the committee now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| I wish that people who had problems with the process or with what we wound up with had been part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:26| and come to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| The next one that everybody was in favor of was Plan 4A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| But we're not going to do that one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| And so the school board now says that they want, they think 3A was the best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| But since we're going to scuttle the work of the whole committee, which why did we do it in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| is what I'm thinking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| And we're going to go with 1A and we're going to force it onto the school board, which didn't even like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| I mean, I think we're just kind of throwing our weight around at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| And, yeah, I'm not happy about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| We had a process for this, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| And the time to say what you wanted or what you didn't want at a public meeting was during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:15| And there were plenty of opportunities to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| And I applaud Dave for going to the school board meetings all this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| and staying caught up with what they were doing with issues that were important to him and his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| And Cindy has been for two committee, two commission meetings now over this representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| or three representing school board interest in the interest of her voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| So, and, yeah, and I've had a long, hard day and have been stuck in a doctor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| and I'm a little short-tempered right now and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| But, guys, we had, there has been opportunity upon opportunity upon opportunity to work with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| And I'm really disappointed with what I've walked into today and what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| And I agree with Ms. Broils about process and the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| I'm not real quick to shoot down what the committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| It's a real close call for me, really, between several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| I see advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| I mean, I see advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| The only one that I really don't like is four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| I mean, I really, the other three, I could be fine with any of those three for multiple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| I did want to ask Ms. Buttry a question, though, about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| are you here as representing the school board or are you just here in observation of our discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:58| I'm here in observation of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| I'm not, I'm here as a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:04| I'm representing myself and my constituency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| But as far as being able to speak for the board, the chair generally speaks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| And did you serve on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Well, you know, again, we've got to go through this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| And I don't, I mean, I just voted against the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| But, again, that's not a strong vote on my part because I see advantages to three of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I, too, appreciate Ms. Buttry being here because having gone to so many school board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| I know that it's not nice to give up another afternoon and maybe we can convince her to run for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:58| oh, I'll leave that blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| I don't even know where she lives, so I don't know what she could run for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| We've had some lengthy discussion about all these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| and I believe we've seen that there's a little bit that we dislike about all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| I just want to refocus on the fact that we've had people before us time and time again saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| when we get down to something, we'd like for them to all look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| And maybe Ms. Burroughs didn't hear me say, so maybe we can all get on the same dirty page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:33| And then the next time this comes up, then everyone will be coming from the same direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| and we can make it look more community oriented if it's not community oriented right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:47| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| The motion on the floor is to approve Plan 1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| I'd like to make a substitute motion to approve 3A for school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| So the motion on the floor is a substitute motion for 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3966)|

| 1:06:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| So 3A is the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I just want to remind you that's not what the community wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=3982)|

| 1:07:49| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| I'll vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Commissioner Norman votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| The vote is 8-3, so Plan 1A passes for the school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| We are in need of looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| If you'll get your calendars out, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| We're in need of calling a special meeting to vote on this on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| And Mr. Rogers explained why we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Here are the days that this room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Wednesday the 2nd from 9 until 3, Thursday the 3rd from 9 until 3, Monday the 7th all day, Thursday the 10th from 9 until noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:30| Friday the 11th all day, but that is Veterans Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| And there are a lot of activities planned on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| So does any day seem better than another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Can we do Monday at 5, the 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Monday the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Yes, Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| What is the actual date deadline that we've been given that we have to have this done by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| Well, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Brad, on the 7th you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Well, the qualifying deadline for the four school board vacancies is noon on December the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:08| But we have got to get this process completed in a reasonable amount of time before that because we've got to get maps printed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| up that I found out from the state today so that those candidates, incumbents, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| or anybody that's wanting to run will know what that district is and can see what that district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| So that's why I was encouraging that, yeah, there's a deadline out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| but we need to get done well in advance of that so those petitions can be picked up and completed and returned in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| Also, these districts have to be approved by the state, too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| Well, the way that works is after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Well, they've got to bless it, but it's pretty perfunctory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| And I talked to the state about that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| How long does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Basically, once I tell them, you all have decided these are the redistrict lines, they're going to bless it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4194)|
| 1:10:02| It's just that then I can tell them you can come pick up the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| But the map is going to take a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I talked to Tim about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| We've got to have the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| So that's going to be more of a holdup than getting a blessing from the state as I understand it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| I have a concern more so than, and I sympathize with the people who are running for office here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:25| but as we all have sat up here and claimed, our main concern is with the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| And we have done a complete change-around from where we were just a week ago at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:39| We need to give the public as much opportunity as possible to look at what we're doing here and to weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:49| Because this is not what we talked about a week ago, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| This is totally new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| So I think that with the 11th being Veterans Day, that's probably out of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| If we absolutely have to have it done by that date, then the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| Because I think that what we're doing is pulling a fast one on the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| And we need to give them as much time as possible to vet this and decide that this is what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| This room is available on Thursday from 9 until noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| We could conceivably meet at 8.30 or earlier if you chose, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| I was just going to ask Brad that the 7th is the day I could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| That's the only day I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Is that the only day you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| That's just no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| The 10th, I mean, the leadership is meeting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| The leadership in Knoxville is meeting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| But I can be late if I need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| I would prefer the 10th or 1st or 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| But 10th is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| I just, you know, for the people that are wanting to run for office, the sooner we do it, the better for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| You know, if we can do it the 7th, that gives them a full month, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| I think it's fair to the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| As far as public and pulling a fast one, we've had public forum after public forum after public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| And, you know, they've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| What time are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| We're looking at Thursday, the 10th at 9 o'clock, 8.30, 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| The earlier, the better, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| No, I'm thinking about you because I know that's important, what you're doing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Can we do it in the afternoon at 4.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| 4.30 is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Is it open at 4.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| You mean Thursday, the 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| Thursday, the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Thursday, the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Jolie, you gave me 9 until noon on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| Unless we, could we do it in the small assembly room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| But we need to probably do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| So the availability they gave us on the 10th was 9 until noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| And I guess the second question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| If we don't have it here, can we go across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| They have capabilities to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| A.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| There's Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| I just think that that time works for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| I think we need to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Thursday, the 10th is the monthly MPC meeting in that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| So it's typically blocked out the whole afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| But our agenda is going to be extremely short that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| What time is your meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Do you think 4.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| I can guarantee we'll be done by 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Let's say 4.30 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| 4.30 on the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Does that work for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| The only thing I was going to bring up is that you had offered earlier dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| The sooner we do this, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| Because if this does not pass second reading, we're back to a first reading that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| This had better pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| So that's the only point I was going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Mr. Rogers, if we did it on the 10th at 4.30 and should it pass, is that enough time for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| It would be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| So unless I hear objections, we'll do Thursday the 10th at 4.30 here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| If for some reason the MPC happens to run a tad longer, we'll just start as soon as they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| But we're pretty confident they'll be done by 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| So, Julie, if you'll set aside and we'll send out the proper notices the 10th at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Just to ensure that you have legal notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| That actually requires a letter of request to the mayor to call that special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| I'll send him a letter tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Mr. Law Director, what is a substantial change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| If there was a precinct change, would that be substantial or would it be a map change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| that would be substantial to cause a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| In terms of the plan you're adopting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| If somebody come in and had a solution that changed a couple of precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| would that constitute another first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| There's no litmus test, but that sounds pretty close to a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| I'm thinking since we are in session and we're talking about this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| we could go ahead and vote to meet that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| I mean, we can have the mayor do it, but do we really need to have the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| Well, technically, the way that the Tennessee Code reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| it actually requires a written application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Now, the oddity is it's either a written application to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| or the majority of the commissioners submit a written application to the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| So it's a matter of once you actually vote to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| it's a matter of reducing it to writing and that could be done with all expedience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| But you can vote today to set that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| So is there a motion that we meet on Thursday the 10th at 430?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Motion to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Okay, I will send the letter to the mayor just to cover all of our bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| But you all have instructed me to have that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| and I'll just let him know that we're going to be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| If he has any issues, he can let us know, but we'll go ahead and make the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| So Thursday the 10th at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| We have two discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Do you want a break before 6 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| We've got zonings at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Zonings at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Let's see if we can get through these discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| The first one was discussion regarding finances, county finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| Commissioner Briggs, you had asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Yes, this was in reference to the article in the newspaper about how there was a discrepancy of several million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| And we've had phone calls and e-mails about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| and I wanted to give the trustee the opportunity to explain just what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| It's just mostly so this isn't out there for a month or for weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| where all sorts of rumors and bogs and everything else gets started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Just to clear it up right now in the public so the public will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I'm John Duncan, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| And I appreciate the opportunity to clear this issue up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| I know it did scare a lot of people over the weekend to read the article in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| saying that there were accounting errors and that we were out of balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| And I'm pleased to report that the issues have been pinpointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and it's turned out it was nothing more than a simple routine type error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| And I have before me and I can give commissioners copies of the schedules which were turned into the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| We have the actual schedule as well as the working papers which back it all up with numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| All the numbers we provided to the auditors in the working papers were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| The mistake came on the front page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| The schedule which is basically a summary of the papers and one account was left off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| which caused the total on this report to be less than the total that the county actually had on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| So we reported that on June 30, 2011, we had $122.7 million on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| We left off one account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| That number should have been $128.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| And this is an error that anyone can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| It's essentially like a typo or a clerical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| When the accountant was preparing it, he didn't properly link the files in the spreadsheet to the right account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| So that account was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| I talked to Richard Walls a little while ago and he said in auditing over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| he sees problems like this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| It's routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| It's just rare that something like this would end up in the newspaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| before we've had a chance to hear about it to fix it and address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| And that's really the frustrating part that somebody for reasons that I don't want to speculate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| would leak out emails prematurely which in my opinion has done some harm to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:59| But I'm glad to reassure you today that every cent is accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| There never was missing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| This was just a simple mistake in a report from one accountant to another accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| And I'm proud of the work that our office has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| And I want to continue to keep up the same level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| And I'd be happy to answer any questions you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Six million dollars isn't a simple kind of mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| But the tone, I guess I struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| Because at the end of the day, we're holding you accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| At the end of the day, we're dealing in an open and transparent situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| And, you know, it's how we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| It's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| And, you know, I think air of, oh, it's no big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:55| I just don't think that's the way that we want to present ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| And I'm looking at this holistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| I mean, we are the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| We're still in a process to build the trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| You took over an office that lived in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| for negative things and negative reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| and negative affairs that was done prior to you getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| I mean, that's where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| So, you know, to point the finger at a newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| we could have done that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| Quit talking about Black Friday, Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| Quit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| You know, we're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| That's not where we reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| This is a serious error in terms of the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| I mean, at the end of the day, okay, it may have checked some balances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| may or may not have corrected itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| But, you know, I just don't like the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| it's not my fault that it got reported to you attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| To me, that smacks of we would have taken it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| taken care of it ourselves, stay out of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| That's not the world we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| When you ran, when I ran, we knew what we were running for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| So, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| what are you going to do to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| that this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| What steps have you taken to ensure yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| and us that this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Well, I can tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| This number was prepared by an accountant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| who was directly asked by an auditor to provide the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| And I'm going to ensure that no numbers go out of our office in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| unless first they go to management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| so we have a chance to review everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| But I also want to mention that this report was never final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| The audit is a work in process that goes on over weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| And typically audits include give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| Auditors will ask for information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| We'll prepare it. We'll give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Sometimes they're going to have questions or concerns about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| and come back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| So, it's really kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| we're in the third quarter of a ball game right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| and not at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| And so, you can't really jump to conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| on who's won and lost while it's still ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| But the mistake definitely has opened our eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| and it's going to cause us to change some procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And I'm sorry if my tone seemed unapologetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| I am sorry that a mistake like this would come out of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| But I would like to reassure the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| that this mistake was on one line of the first draft of a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| It wasn't final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| And no actual dollars were ever in question in the bank accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| John, you were showing me some papers out in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| You've got about three pages that you're holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| that you've got there that led your sheets and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Can you get that to each of us as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| and get the bullet points as to how you broke that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| if we have questions we can get with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Yeah, I'd absolutely be happy to provide any of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| as much documentation as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| And also, for anyone in the public out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| that wants to come and take a look at these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| and take a look at our books, I'm more than happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| And it's one of, you know, in transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| you have, you know, sometimes people are going to see both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| And so they're going to see the work as it is in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| And I'm happy to let anybody in, let anybody take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| you know, as we're building towards the end of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| And I'd be happy to provide the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| with anything you all need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Unless we're going to see it in the paper tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| I don't know if you've talked to the media today or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| but if you've talked to the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| Just let us know how those, the sheets that you had there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| the ledger sheets that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| And the bullet points to explain what you're trying to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Mr. Duncan, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| And welcome to Knox County Politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| We have another discussion item on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| I want to give the commission an anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| early Christmas present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| And that would be to get the Hillside plan off of your back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| forever, or at least for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Of course, what you just received from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| from the staff, the people that worked together on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| three documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| One was kind of the amendments which we made that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| summarized the work of the facilitated process between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| That's a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| These are in your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| We had thought that the best way to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| so, you know, at the end of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| there were some specific items that we changed in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| the original plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| So that's one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| Then another item was De La Volpe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| Councilman De La Volpe's ideas and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| We've listed those and used those for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| and the discussion was to add those as an appendix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| which he had several things that we thought were very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| very good to be added as recommendations to our document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| And then the last item that you've been sent was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| what we called the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| We fleshed out what we call implementation of the do list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| essentially what we're to do in the future as regards this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| you know, the review process on these sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| or code changes, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| So those are the three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| And hopefully those for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| I have no idea what council is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| but hopefully for us we, this will be brought up in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| If we approve it, it becomes our plan and then our new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| and then we get to send it back to MPC for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| So that's what we hope for your Christmas present and mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| mainly mine, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| But that's what you've got in your mailboxes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| Where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| It's emailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| It only had to come today then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Well, it's common or it's either here or it's on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I have traded phone messages with Joe Bailey over at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| and so we're looking at setting up that workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| between the city council and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| to kind of go over the compromises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| that Mr. Donaldson has submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| So we will let you know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| For those of you here for zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| we're going to take a 10-minute break and we will be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| and we'll get right back to you on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| So it shouldn't take us very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| We have a light agenda on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:27| Zoning portion of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| Point of personal privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| last night at 11 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Abigail Grace Hammond was born in Orlando, Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| Seven pounds to son Seth and daughter-in-law Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| I know you all are looking at me saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| I can't be that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| It is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| It is true that I have maintained that youthful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| virile look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| However, I am a papaw for the fourth time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| But little Abby Grace is doing extremely well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| and can't wait to see her in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5279)|
| 1:28:00| You'll need one of those granddaddy policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| You made a quick trip back from Florida overnight then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| First item on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| The first item is 86-D-11-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| This request of Vance and Pam Griffin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| for rezoning from RA, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| to A Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Located southwest side of Schaffner Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| northwest of Griffith Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| The applicant is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5308)|

| 1:28:55| With him not being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| then it goes away completely from here on out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| unless he reapplies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| Well, I mean, essentially him not being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| you're taking no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5346)|

| 1:29:43| 9th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Well, I guess it's bite down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Since the City Council has passed on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| I'll make a motion that we approve the South Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| South City Sector Plan, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| I think it's irregardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| The city passed on voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| Well, they approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| Oh, they passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| I'll just be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| We're just going to do the fact that it already has the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| in it that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Does it still have the hillside in it, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| Yes, it's got language from the hillside plan in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| I'll be voting no just so we don't have to redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Now, clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| This is just for the city only, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| inside the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| All of our sectors have a little bit of both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| for the central city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| So around the edges of the South City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| there are pockets that are not in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| But the vast majority of the land is within the city boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| So the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| Well, I was basing it on what the city council had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| I mean, if you all feel more comfortable waiting until we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| you know, get the hillside thing out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| But the folks over there are ready for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| I mean, this is what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Did the city approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| No, they passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| They approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Did the city pass it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| They didn't pass the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| They passed the sector change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| The city approved the sector plan last week on 1st Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:23| So you still want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| I'll withdraw my motion then and make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| You need to get the second withdrawal first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Second withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Do you wish to make another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Then I'll make a new motion that we postpone it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| in this case, 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| Hopefully we'll be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Or until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111024part2?start=5502)|
