| 5:57:54| MPC staff recommendation was to deny the requested LDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21474)|
| 5:58:01| If that were the deciding factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21481)|
| 5:58:05| Metropolitan Planning Commission recommended approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21485)|
| 5:58:09| or you wouldn't see it here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21489)|
| 5:58:11| You're only seeing this because it passed MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21491)|
| 5:58:14| Okay, so can I make a motion, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21494)|
| 5:58:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21499)|
| 5:58:21| There's been a motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21501)|
| 5:58:23| Has there been a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21503)|
| 5:58:24| Has there been a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21504)|
| 5:58:26| It died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21506)|
| 5:58:27| Did you make that ruling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21507)|
| 5:58:28| No, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21508)|
| 5:58:29| The motion can fail for lack of a second, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21509)|
| 5:58:35| you still have to have a vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21515)|
| 5:58:39| Okay, so, okay, can I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21519)|

| 5:59:09| Commissioners requested that we adopt the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21549)|

| 5:59:37| So, would the reflection indicate motion to approve sector plan amendment per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21577)|
| 5:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21585)|

| 6:01:23| 3-D-18-RZ, request of Randy Grenard for rezoning from RB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21683)|

| 6:01:35| at a density up to 5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21695)|

| 6:02:17| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21737)|
| 6:02:27| Report from the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21747)|
| 6:02:30| Mr. Chair, members of the Commission, the Metropolitan Planning Commission voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21750)|
| 6:02:33| recommend approval of PR zoning at a density of 2.75 units per acre by a vote of 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21753)|
| 6:02:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21762)|
| 6:02:44| The applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21764)|
| 6:02:46| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21766)|
| 6:02:48| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21768)|
| 6:02:55| Here on behalf of the applicant, Mr. Gennard, I feel like a lot of this was addressed during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21775)|
| 6:03:03| the brief discussion of the Sector Plan Amendment and the request to low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21783)|
| 6:03:09| and Commissioner Nystrom brought up the question as to why the applicant requested 2.75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21789)|
| 6:03:15| at the MPC Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21795)|
| 6:03:16| I explained that as to prior to Mr. Mormon's involvement in calculating the proper density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21796)|
| 6:03:22| with the infrastructure cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21802)|
| 6:03:24| Also, important to note that the 2.75 units per dwelling acre was based on a calculable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21804)|
| 6:03:32| acreage count of, I believe, 75 or 78, whatever the number of acreage was earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21812)|
| 6:03:40| whereas in reality the acreage count to be calculated is 61.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21820)|
| 6:03:46| So, under a 2.75 density units per acres at 75 or 78 acres, whatever the number was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21826)|
| 6:03:58| that number, 2.75 multiplied by that acreage count, would have resulted in 195 approximate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21838)|
| 6:04:05| dwelling units for this development, with a 3.1 density calculated over 61.5 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21845)|
| 6:04:14| 3.1 per dwelling unit per acre would be 172 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21854)|
| 6:04:20| Ultimately, a lesser density than what would have been realized on the property based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21860)|
| 6:04:27| the earlier calculable acreage of 75, 78 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21867)|
| 6:04:33| With that being said, again, the reason for the 3.1 dwelling units is the total infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21873)|
| 6:04:40| cost. Mr. Mormon explained it earlier, the per linear foot cost and the amount of per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21880)|
| 6:04:48| linear infrastructure before you even get to the developable area that must be absorbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21888)|
| 6:04:54| to support the development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21894)|
| 6:04:56| Again, 3.1 in Knox County current Knoxville development trends is a very conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21896)|
| 6:05:03| density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21903)|
| 6:05:05| Average densities per acre in Knox County on average are higher than 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21905)|
| 6:05:14| Again, this is a large property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21914)|
| 6:05:19| We have a preliminary concept plan that was just created, a draft of, to show that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21919)|
| 6:05:26| is not a far reaching density request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21926)|
| 6:05:30| This density request actually stays well out of the floodplain, stays down below, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21930)|
| 6:05:38| Mormon can cite the actual grade of the hilltop protection plan, which is just a guideline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21938)|
| 6:05:44| for the commissioners, stays below that and creates a proper conservative development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21944)|
| 6:05:51| If I could pass this around and I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21951)|
| 6:05:55| Can I have a point of order, or to ask him a quick question while he's doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21955)|
| 6:06:01| Okay, you're using 61.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21961)|
| 6:06:06| You multiply it by 3.1, that's 190 home sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21966)|
| 6:06:14| It's only 56 usable acres you've got to take out the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21974)|
| 6:06:18| I'm using his number and he's saying 61, so 56 times 3.1 comes up to 172.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21978)|
| 6:06:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21985)|
| 6:06:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21986)|
| 6:06:28| Again, here physically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21988)|
| 6:06:31| 56 acres outside of the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21991)|
| 6:06:34| 56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21994)|
| 6:06:37| Ms. Rowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=21997)|
| 6:06:46| My name is Courtney Shea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22006)|
| 6:06:48| I live on 3926 Beverly Place, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22008)|
| 6:06:52| You have the MPC staff slope density analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22012)|
| 6:07:02| Based on the, you know, Knox County went through this steep slope sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22022)|
| 6:07:08| so I'm not sure what page it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22028)|
| 6:07:10| My iPad doesn't give you a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22030)|
| 6:07:12| Oh, it's number 10, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22032)|
| 6:07:14| And I think you have it in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22034)|
| 6:07:17| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22037)|
| 6:07:18| For some reason, and this was before the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22038)|
| 6:07:22| so they were already looking at 61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22042)|
| 6:07:25| I'm not sure where the acres came up as possibly developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22045)|
| 6:07:32| because they had to take out the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22052)|
| 6:07:34| I'm not sure when they calculated that 61 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22054)|
| 6:07:38| whether they also took out the railroad right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22058)|
| 6:07:42| But using the maximum density analysis, 2.75 was a stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22062)|
| 6:07:50| because these are very, very steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22070)|
| 6:07:53| And the kinds of runoff problems you're going to get from dense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22073)|
| 6:07:59| from, you know, even this level of density on these steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22079)|
| 6:08:04| is going to be very, it's going to be very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22084)|
| 6:08:08| So using the density guidelines, 2.47 would be the maximum density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22088)|
| 6:08:19| So already 3.1 is way beyond what this piece of property can probably absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22099)|
| 6:08:27| 2.75 was beyond what it can absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22107)|
| 6:08:32| 2.47 is the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22112)|
| 6:08:34| And I would say I think that underestimates how steep these slopes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22114)|
| 6:08:39| the kinds of problems you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22119)|
| 6:08:41| You're going to have to put so much hardscape into any one dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22121)|
| 6:08:47| in order to deal with, you know, the slopes and, you know, and driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22127)|
| 6:08:54| And you're going to have to like wind your driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22134)|
| 6:08:57| instead of just being able to go straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22137)|
| 6:08:59| When you put that much hardscape in, you're just going to add to your flooding problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22139)|
| 6:09:04| I think 2.47 is too high a density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22144)|
| 6:09:08| And that's why the MPC staff, they looked at that and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22148)|
| 6:09:13| this is really land that it can be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22153)|
| 6:09:16| And there's some beautiful areas on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22156)|
| 6:09:19| But one, you know, one dwelling unit per acre is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22159)|
| 6:09:26| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22166)|
| 6:09:27| Excuse me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22167)|
| 6:09:29| She said 2.47 is what the analysis was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22169)|
| 6:09:32| I thought it was lower than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22172)|
| 6:09:34| No, that's 2.47 is what the analysis shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22174)|
| 6:09:41| But starting with a base of five units per acre on the land with no slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22181)|
| 6:09:50| and then going down from that based on the slope with a density of two units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22190)|
| 6:09:57| on slopes of 15 to 25 percent, half a unit an acre on 25 to 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22197)|
| 6:10:02| and 0.2 units per acre on slopes of more than 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22202)|
| 6:10:14| Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22214)|
| 6:10:16| Well, I again turn to the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22216)|
| 6:10:19| They're the people we pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22219)|
| 6:10:21| They're the people that are the planners, not the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22221)|
| 6:10:28| And they say the steep slopes and floodway of the characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22228)|
| 6:10:32| make it unsuitable for a density of greater than one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22232)|
| 6:10:39| We're begging you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22239)|
| 6:10:41| All of this district is going to be underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22241)|
| 6:10:44| The city spent $2.3 million to correct Emerland and Fairmont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22244)|
| 6:10:51| It's barely out of their homes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22251)|
| 6:10:55| This will come with a vengeance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22255)|
| 6:10:58| Mr. Vanderveet talked to you about the velocity and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22258)|
| 6:11:03| Okay, where you used to flood one day, you're going to flood five now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22263)|
| 6:11:06| It'll be underwater five days rather than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22266)|
| 6:11:10| We beg of you, one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22270)|
| 6:11:13| It gives him reasonable use of his land, and that's all you're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22273)|
| 6:11:17| You're not required to give him the highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22277)|
| 6:11:20| You're not supposed to take into consideration that it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22280)|
| 6:11:24| that it's going to cost him a lot of money to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22284)|
| 6:11:27| Look at the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22287)|
| 6:11:28| Look at the people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22288)|
| 6:11:36| Mr. Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22296)|
| 6:11:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22299)|
| 6:11:40| I've heard two numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22300)|
| 6:11:42| Some said, was it 5.56 acres, 61 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22302)|
| 6:11:50| What is the developable land we're talking about that we're going to do the calculation on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22310)|
| 6:11:57| 56 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22317)|
| 6:11:59| 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22319)|
| 6:12:01| I mean 56 acres, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22321)|
| 6:12:03| It's 56 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22323)|
| 6:12:05| If you can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22325)|
| 6:12:06| We'll go home now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22326)|
| 6:12:09| 56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22329)|
| 6:12:10| Okay, if you do 56 at three units, it's 173.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22330)|
| 6:12:16| If you drop down, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22336)|
| 6:12:22| Speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22342)|
| 6:12:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22343)|
| 6:12:24| I said if you do three at 56, that's 173.6, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22344)|
| 6:12:31| If you do, it's the number, it's the, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22351)|
| 6:12:43| 173.6 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22363)|
| 6:12:47| Once, 3.1 is what they originally asked for, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22367)|
| 6:12:51| I just wanted to find out what the acreage was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22371)|
| 6:13:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22384)|
| 6:13:06| I just need to clarify under the comment section under MPC, because we continue to say 2.71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22386)|
| 6:13:13| What is highlighted is 2.61, not 2.71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22393)|
| 6:13:19| So, I just need to make sure we're looking at one dwelling unit per acre at 2.47 density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22399)|
| 6:13:28| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22408)|
| 6:13:29| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22409)|
| 6:13:30| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22410)|
| 6:13:31| 2.47 homes per acre, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22411)|
| 6:13:34| And the staff is saying one home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22414)|
| 6:13:40| I'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22420)|
| 6:13:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22423)|
| 6:13:44| I voted for changing the sector plan to LDR because I thought that's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22424)|
| 6:13:50| the correct thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22430)|
| 6:13:51| I'm not for your 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22431)|
| 6:13:52| I'll tell you that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22432)|
| 6:13:53| Where that number is going to be, is it going to be 2.47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22433)|
| 6:13:57| Is it going to be low, below 2.47?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22437)|
| 6:14:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22440)|
| 6:14:01| I'm not sure where the 2.47 came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22441)|
| 6:14:04| The 2.47 is the using this the recommended slope calculations as set forth in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22444)|
| 6:14:13| and our top protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22453)|
| 6:14:15| Those calculations came out to 2.47 units per acre overall on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22455)|
| 6:14:22| developable portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22462)|
| 6:14:25| Staff reviewed that, looked at the constraints of the property, and staff did not go with the 2.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22465)|
| 6:14:33| Again, it's recommended we looked at the other constraints of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22473)|
| 6:14:37| The planning commission looked at that and used that as more of a guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22477)|
| 6:14:41| for coming up with the 2.75 units per acre that they recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22481)|
| 6:14:50| 2.47 times the 56 acres is 154 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22490)|
| 6:14:55| To me, that sounds reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22495)|
| 6:14:56| So I like that ridge top, hill top plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22496)|
| 6:15:04| Page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22504)|
| 6:15:06| It's on page 10 of the MPC packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22506)|
| 6:15:08| But if you look in the report, it mentions 2.61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22508)|
| 6:15:12| And that's what Ms. Gill is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22512)|
| 6:15:13| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22513)|
| 6:15:15| We have a staff person who will be reprimanded this week for depending on cut and paste more than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22515)|
| 6:15:23| So it is 2.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22523)|
| 6:15:25| It's 2.47 as a calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22525)|
| 6:15:27| That's the number we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22527)|
| 6:15:28| Thank you, Mr. Green, because I'm reading directly out of MPC's documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22528)|
| 6:15:32| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22532)|
| 6:15:33| And I apologize for that staff person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22533)|
| 6:15:38| And what acreage were y'all basing that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22538)|
| 6:15:41| That would be based on the 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22541)|
| 6:15:47| Our question to Mr. Green is what was he basing that acreage on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22547)|
| 6:15:51| That number and what acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22551)|
| 6:15:52| 61.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22552)|
| 6:15:56| 61.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22556)|
| 6:15:59| Times 2.47 is 152.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22559)|
| 6:16:02| That's a yield of 152 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22562)|
| 6:16:07| But the MPC staff recommended one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22567)|
| 6:16:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22570)|
| 6:16:11| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22571)|
| 6:16:12| But MPC Commission approved 2.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22572)|
| 6:16:14| I know what they voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22574)|
| 6:16:16| I'm wanting to know what the engineers thought and the professional planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22576)|
| 6:16:22| And that was based upon the slope analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22582)|
| 6:16:25| Again, using that as a guide, but also the more severe constraints of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22585)|
| 6:16:29| What were those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22589)|
| 6:16:31| The slope, the floodway, the challenges of developing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22591)|
| 6:16:41| I would ask that you as the Commission would give consideration to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22601)|
| 6:16:46| evaluation that I did on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22606)|
| 6:16:48| As you see that plan, the upper limits of the development is shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22608)|
| 6:16:53| which is well down from the ridge top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22613)|
| 6:16:56| lies for the most part on slopes less than 20% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22616)|
| 6:17:02| There is developers all over town that are developing properties that are steeper than 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22622)|
| 6:17:08| That was a conservative utilizing the best available data we had to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22628)|
| 6:17:16| That being said, that, as you see, gave a yield of 172.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22636)|
| 6:17:22| I recognize that you all are having a hard time with that, and I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22642)|
| 6:17:27| Maybe we could get together and discuss what is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22647)|
| 6:17:30| But at 2.47 and yielding 152 units, this project, the numbers don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22650)|
| 6:17:40| We're back at the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22660)|
| 6:17:41| We're going to have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22661)|
| 6:17:43| We would prefer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22663)|
| 6:17:45| If I may ask a question, you said in using the best data available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22665)|
| 6:17:49| Now, do you have access to different data than NPC does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22669)|
| 6:17:53| I have the information from the LIDAR that the state performed on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22673)|
| 6:17:59| Is that different than the KGIS maps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22679)|
| 6:18:01| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22681)|
| 6:18:02| Do you have any knowledge of the accuracy of either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22682)|
| 6:18:06| I could tell you that utilizing the information on KGIS mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22686)|
| 6:18:10| many times that I have checked that and found it to be as much as two and three feet in error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22690)|
| 6:18:15| on this latest information that has been available just in the last two...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22695)|
| 6:18:20| in the last year, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22700)|
| 6:18:23| I have checked that on numerous sites and found it to be more like within a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22703)|
| 6:18:28| So a lot better data, no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22708)|
| 6:18:31| How accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22711)|
| 6:18:32| I can't say without truly surveying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22712)|
| 6:18:35| And Mr. Mormon, does this preliminary concept plan factor in, which is just a guideline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22715)|
| 6:18:45| is not the ordinance, the hilltop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22725)|
| 6:18:48| Knox County has not adopted it as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22728)|
| 6:18:50| Does it factor that in to the preliminary concept plan that you've set out here with 172 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22730)|
| 6:18:56| It really does not because it's just a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22736)|
| 6:18:59| And I don't feel that it's fair to the property owner or the public to honor that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22739)|
| 6:19:05| It, in my mind, it devalues the property and they didn't have the opportunity to defend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22745)|
| 6:19:10| against that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22750)|
| 6:19:11| And I feel this body ruled appropriately when they said, no, we're not adopting this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22751)|
| 6:19:16| We're going to use it as a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22756)|
| 6:19:19| As I stated, I was very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22759)|
| 6:19:22| It is a guideline, but this is, of all the properties I've ever seen while sitting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22762)|
| 6:19:26| commission, the one it most applies to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22766)|
| 6:19:31| And Mr. Mormon, this preliminary concept plan that you've created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22771)|
| 6:19:35| what degrees or slopes are those within?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22775)|
| 6:19:39| For the very most part, except for the tops of those cul-de-sacs and the lots that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22779)|
| 6:19:46| along the access road coming in before you get to where the property becomes very developable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22786)|
| 6:19:51| I'm under 20 percent, with the exception of those small areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22791)|
| 6:19:55| And do you know the recommendation of the MPC hilltop protection plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22795)|
| 6:20:01| Not supposed to be within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22801)|
| 6:20:06| What slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22806)|
| 6:20:07| What slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22807)|
| 6:20:08| The slope sets a range of densities based on the plan, sets a range of densities based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22808)|
| 6:20:15| on the slope, with slopes of 15 to 25 percent recommended at two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22815)|
| 6:20:23| So who's below you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22823)|
| 6:20:24| And there has been discussion with Mr. Green on the cluster development, which would also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22824)|
| 6:20:31| fall within the density, actually would result in a higher density to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22831)|
| 6:20:36| And I haven't been a part of those discussions, so I'll lean that to Mr. Mormon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22836)|
| 6:20:40| When we met before the very first time this body met in regards to the rezoning and sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22840)|
| 6:20:47| planning, and we chose to postpone, Ms. Carringer, I think, instigated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22847)|
| 6:20:55| My first thing was, gosh, what's Ms. Rowe talking about, that the commission acted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22855)|
| 6:21:01| error?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22861)|
| 6:21:02| So I went, I called for a meeting with staff, which Mr. Green and several of his staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22862)|
| 6:21:07| were in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22867)|
| 6:21:09| And at that meeting, I presented that I felt that they had erred by not considering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22869)|
| 6:21:17| current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22877)|
| 6:21:18| And as Mr. Green has testified here today or stated, that is not in their policy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22878)|
| 6:21:23| review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22883)|
| 6:21:24| In that discussion, it was stated that maybe we ought to reconsider how we do our sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22884)|
| 6:21:30| planning and consider the current zoning, because it does impact what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22890)|
| 6:21:34| with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22894)|
| 6:21:36| That being said, he did look at my conceptual there, which is a conventional design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22896)|
| 6:21:43| not something that I'm telling you that I would promote development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22903)|
| 6:21:48| I'm telling you that that would be what most developers here in town would go towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22908)|
| 6:21:53| and that yields the density that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22913)|
| 6:21:55| And that's why I utilized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22915)|
| 6:21:57| Mr. Green shared with me that he felt that this was a perfect site, and I'm in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22917)|
| 6:22:02| with him, for a cluster development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22922)|
| 6:22:04| My response to that was, in a cluster development, given the usable land, would it not yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22924)|
| 6:22:12| a higher density than we're even requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22932)|
| 6:22:15| And Mr. Green agreed with me it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22935)|
| 6:22:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22937)|
| 6:22:21| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22941)|
| 6:22:23| Well, I want to say that, you know, we talked about, you know, I was, there's nobody up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22943)|
| 6:22:29| here that, I guess me and Dave were the ones that fought through that hilltop restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22949)|
| 6:22:35| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22955)|
| 6:22:36| And the reason I didn't want it to blanket the county is because it would have been unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22956)|
| 6:22:41| overall to blanket the county with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22961)|
| 6:22:43| But I'll tell you, this piece of property is unique, and it can't sustain traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22963)|
| 6:22:54| It can't sustain the flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22974)|
| 6:22:57| It can't sustain what you're drawing you gave us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22977)|
| 6:23:03| You know, I think it's overuse of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22983)|
| 6:23:08| I think the, you know, you say it's cost too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22988)|
| 6:23:11| Well, it's a bad piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22991)|
| 6:23:13| And so when you buy that, it's not up to us to fix your cost on a bad piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=22993)|
| 6:23:25| I'm not comfortable with, you know, the comments you made was that you didn't apply the hilltop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23005)|
| 6:23:34| protection program because you didn't think it was fair when you did this concept right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23014)|
| 6:23:38| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23018)|
| 6:23:38| So I already know that this concept's probably a little heavier than we want it because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23018)|
| 6:23:44| that, you know, the hilltop is less concern to me than the floodplain and the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23024)|
| 6:23:50| tracks and what happens south of here going off across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23030)|
| 6:23:55| I'm, you know, I was in favor, like Carson, in favor of changing Delta R, but I'm certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23035)|
| 6:24:00| not for the capacity that you've asked for this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23040)|
| 6:24:03| And so I think that I won't be voting for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23043)|
| 6:24:09| I'm struggling to vote for 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23049)|
| 6:24:12| I'll be in the two range probably, but the capacity is not there for this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23052)|
| 6:24:17| and there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23057)|
| 6:24:18| The floodplain is the main reason for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23058)|
| 6:24:22| I guess I'll put this out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23062)|
| 6:24:24| I'm more in the 1.5 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23064)|
| 6:24:33| Coonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23073)|
| 6:24:37| Based on that number you just said, I'd like to make a motion that we approve for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23077)|
| 6:24:41| development a total of 100 residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23081)|
| 6:24:55| The commission can express density in a number of different ways and the maximum number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23095)|
| 6:25:00| developable units would be an appropriate way to express density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23100)|
| 6:25:03| There's been a lot of confusion about the number of developable acres, so expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23103)|
| 6:25:08| density in the form of a total number of developable units might be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23108)|
| 6:25:14| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23114)|
| 6:25:16| Okay, you make your motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23116)|
| 6:25:19| Restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23119)|
| 6:25:20| I make a motion that we allow 100 total residential lots for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23120)|
| 6:25:28| Okay, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23128)|
| 6:25:31| This time we'd like to withdraw the motion or withdraw the application request for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23131)|
| 6:25:45| The sector plan has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23145)|
| 6:25:48| The withdrawal won't affect that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23148)|
| 6:25:50| Correct, but for the rezoning we would keep the same zoning as of now based on the indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23150)|
| 6:25:57| of the low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23157)|
| 6:26:00| Okay, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23160)|
| 6:26:04| He's got to declare it withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23164)|
| 6:26:10| Withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23170)|
| 6:26:18| I mean, I'm not, you know, it's a property rights issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23178)|
| 6:26:20| He doesn't want to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23180)|
| 6:26:21| I don't think we should rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23181)|
| 6:26:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23182)|
| 6:26:24| Okay, we accept your request to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23184)|
| 6:26:26| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23186)|
| 6:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23191)|

| 6:27:02| There's one thing everybody keeps overlooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23222)|
| 6:27:05| That piece of property only has one entrance and one exit, and it's 50 feet from the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23225)|
| 6:27:10| tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23230)|
| 6:27:11| It comes around a blind curve, and if you start dumping 100 cars a day out of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23231)|
| 6:27:17| onto Beverly Road, you're going to be picking up bodies every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23237)|
| 6:27:22| That's all I got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23242)|

| 6:28:45| If the applicant wishes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23325)|

| 6:28:54| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23334)|
| 6:28:55| Mr. Chairman, members of Commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., I am here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23335)|
| 6:29:00| applicant, Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23340)|
| 6:29:04| Let me point out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23344)|
| 6:29:06| This property is adjacent to a subdivision known as Laurel Ridge subdivision that Ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23346)|
| 6:29:14| Homes is presently developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23354)|
| 6:29:17| The sector plan for this property is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23357)|
| 6:29:25| We are here only on a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23365)|
| 6:29:28| Ball Homes requested planned residential at up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23368)|
| 6:29:33| MPC staff recommended planned residential zoning at up to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23373)|
| 6:29:41| So the requested zoning is consistent with the sector plan and consistent with surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23381)|
| 6:29:51| development as noted by the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23391)|
| 6:29:55| When Ball Homes developed the Laurel Ridge subdivision and had a use-on review, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23395)|
| 6:30:02| by the way is a zone for planned residential at up to four units per acre, as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23402)|
| 6:30:10| use-on review, MPC required that a road be stubbed out into this property from the Laurel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23410)|
| 6:30:17| Ridge subdivision and it did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23417)|
| 6:30:21| So there's already a road connecting this with the Laurel Ridge subdivision and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23421)|
| 6:30:28| they would not be using any other streets to obtain access to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23428)|
| 6:30:35| So there will be no access from this property to Bryant Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23435)|
| 6:30:43| As a matter of fact, if the zoning is approved, the portion of Bryant Lane that is surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23443)|
| 6:30:50| by this property will have to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23450)|
| 6:30:53| At the use-on review stage, Ball Homes will be required to update its traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23453)|
| 6:31:02| MPC staff has already stated that and any improvements that the traffic study identifies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23462)|
| 6:31:09| they will be required to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23469)|
| 6:31:12| The subdivision that Ball Homes is building here is one that has a number of amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23472)|
| 6:31:19| It has sidewalks throughout the streets in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23479)|
| 6:31:24| It will have a clubhouse and it will have a swimming pool and open spaces throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23484)|
| 6:31:31| the subdivision, so it will have a full package of amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23491)|
| 6:31:36| Part of this property is in the technology overlay zone or overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23496)|
| 6:31:44| Prior to going to MPC, Ball Homes went to the Tennessee Technology Development Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23504)|
| 6:31:51| and it unanimously approved and recommended the zoning add up to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23511)|
| 6:32:00| So we ask that you approve what MPC staff originally recommended, which is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23520)|
| 6:32:07| with the sector plan and consistent with surrounding zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23527)|
| 6:32:13| I am not unmindful of the fact that Pellissippi State has sent a letter to you all requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23533)|
| 6:32:20| that this be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23540)|
| 6:32:22| And they also had a representative at the Planning Commission requesting that the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23542)|
| 6:32:30| be denied so they could purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23550)|
| 6:32:33| I would point out to you and I direct this question or suggest you all talk to the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23553)|
| 6:32:40| director that that is not a proper basis for denying this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23560)|
| 6:32:48| As a matter of fact, Ball Homes made an arm's length offer to the estate that owns this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23568)|
| 6:32:56| property and that offer was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23576)|
| 6:33:00| I will not get into the legalities of it, but I suggest that what Pellissippi State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23580)|
| 6:33:06| is doing is interfering tortiously with a contract, a valid existing contract between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23586)|
| 6:33:14| Ball Homes and the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23594)|
| 6:33:17| This property in Tennessee that is a tort that subjects the person interfering with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23597)|
| 6:33:24| the contract to travel damages potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23604)|
| 6:33:28| But at any rate, I don't think you need to even consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23608)|
| 6:33:32| I think the law director will tell you this is not the proper basis for denying a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23612)|
| 6:33:39| So in summary, this zoning request of Ball Homes is consistent with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23619)|
| 6:33:47| consistent with pre-existing development, and we ask your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23627)|
| 6:33:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23632)|
| 6:33:54| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23634)|
| 6:34:01| Ladies and gentlemen, there's still a lot of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23641)|
| 6:34:03| Do you think the extended time period with a three-minute per person would be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23643)|
| 6:34:07| because we have multiple people to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23647)|
| 6:34:10| If that's okay, I didn't offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23650)|
| 6:34:12| I assumed that was going to go all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23652)|
| 6:34:14| Okay, we're going to try to be concise with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23654)|
| 6:34:16| No, I mean the 15 minutes each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23656)|
| 6:34:18| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23658)|
| 6:34:19| So, Arthur, you have 10 more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23659)|
| 6:34:21| Well, can I say my rebuttal as chairman, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23661)|
| 6:34:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23665)|
| 6:34:30| My name is Brad Frazier, and I'm a lawyer here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23670)|
| 6:34:33| I practice at 900 South Gay Street, Suite 8300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23673)|
| 6:34:37| I live in Connors Creek Subdivision, 11016 Walnut Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23677)|
| 6:34:42| I don't represent the people of Hardin Valley who oppose this, but I'm one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23682)|
| 6:34:47| and we have a lot of things in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23687)|
| 6:34:49| You heard the history of what had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23689)|
| 6:34:52| First, this is our third time we've been to visit folks about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23692)|
| 6:34:56| The Technology Corridor Authority originally approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23696)|
| 6:35:01| for this to be removed from the technology overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23701)|
| 6:35:03| Mr. Brantley appropriately abstained from voting in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23703)|
| 6:35:07| because he'd sold a parcel of property to Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23707)|
| 6:35:10| We then came to the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23710)|
| 6:35:14| and I'm going to use technology to hopefully make sure we don't get those confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23714)|
| 6:35:17| I'm going to call planning commissioners commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23717)|
| 6:35:19| I'm just going to call you commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23719)|
| 6:35:21| The planning commissioners, according to this appeal of decision that I see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23721)|
| 6:35:28| it says the applicant name is Ball Homes LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23728)|
| 6:35:31| They don't list the name of the owner of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23731)|
| 6:35:34| My understanding, you'll hear this from the gentleman, the president of Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23734)|
| 6:35:37| is that at the time he approached them there were several heirs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23737)|
| 6:35:41| that were interested in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23741)|
| 6:35:42| and apparently that's reached a point where the property could be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23742)|
| 6:35:46| but I don't know that their interests are represented here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23746)|
| 6:35:49| by somebody who may have an option to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23749)|
| 6:35:52| The planning commissioners heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23752)|
| 6:35:54| In fact, Commissioner Thomas asked who owned the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23754)|
| 6:35:57| and what he was told is 16 or 17 heirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23757)|
| 6:35:59| but their interests weren't represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23759)|
| 6:36:02| There's still no owner on the application for an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23762)|
| 6:36:05| The basis they gave was that the planning commission didn't tell us why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23765)|
| 6:36:10| They couldn't give us a reason why they turned it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23770)|
| 6:36:13| and as your council told you earlier, you don't have to say why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23773)|
| 6:36:16| The only person I've heard explain his vote today was Mr. Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23776)|
| 6:36:19| and I understand why you had to do that in that one circumstance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23779)|
| 6:36:21| but the planning commission heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23781)|
| 6:36:25| there's to consider the best use of the land for the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23785)|
| 6:36:28| They're supposed to consider issues like walkability, connectivity, mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23788)|
| 6:36:33| They're supposed to consider school impact and growth trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23793)|
| 6:36:37| Well, they heard all that, and you're going to hear a little bit of that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23797)|
| 6:36:41| They used that as the basis for denying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23801)|
| 6:36:43| That could be a basis for why they put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23803)|
| 6:36:45| It's in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23805)|
| 6:36:46| They heard testimony about the impact on the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23806)|
| 6:36:49| that children were eating on floors at Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23809)|
| 6:36:52| Ball has talked about the amenities that they're going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23812)|
| 6:36:55| for the people in this one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23815)|
| 6:36:57| but the rest of the Hardin Valley area is not going to have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23817)|
| 6:37:00| It's only going to include the people who live in that one subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23820)|
| 6:37:04| and the reason why that's an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23824)|
| 6:37:07| and the commissioners weren't impressed by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23827)|
| 6:37:09| is a 2009 Park Recreation and Greenways plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23829)|
| 6:37:15| that this body is tasked with providing on page 56| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23835)|
| 6:37:20| to work with Pellissippi State and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23840)|
| 6:37:24| to provide a greenway connecting and developing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23844)|
| 6:37:29| to the schools and parks of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23849)|
| 6:37:33| Mr. Thomas, I believe, asked, where do we stand on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23853)|
| 6:37:36| And nobody could give him an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23856)|
| 6:37:39| I think the reference was that we need to refer to the Parks and Greenways plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23859)|
| 6:37:44| and we need to refer to the greenway coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23864)|
| 6:37:47| I'm unaware that anybody has contacted that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23867)|
| 6:37:50| to decide where this greenway is going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23870)|
| 6:37:53| The 5- and 15-year improvement plan calls for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23873)|
| 6:37:57| to acquire easements to build a Connor Creek greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23877)|
| 6:38:01| So when you put that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23881)|
| 6:38:02| that you're supposed to work with Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23882)|
| 6:38:04| and you're supposed to acquire the land to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23884)|
| 6:38:07| I think you'll understand where we're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23887)|
| 6:38:09| that it's not a tortious interference with a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23889)|
| 6:38:11| It's a promise that the county made several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23891)|
| 6:38:14| to the people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23894)|
| 6:38:15| I'm going to yield the rest of my time to my colleagues who live in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23895)|
| 6:38:22| Okay, I've got to switch glasses, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23902)|
| 6:38:29| My name is Michelle Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23909)|
| 6:38:30| I also live in Connors Creek, 11016 Walnut Creek Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23910)|
| 6:38:35| I was also at the April 12th day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23915)|
| 6:38:38| when we first got the denial over Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23918)|
| 6:38:44| I am here as a representative of the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23924)|
| 6:38:47| to oppose Ball Homes' purchase of the Bryant Lane property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23927)|
| 6:38:51| I do want to thank Ryan Hickey for meeting with us at the HVPA meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23931)|
| 6:38:55| and taking the time to speak with us about some of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23935)|
| 6:38:59| As has been discussed at many MPC and county commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23939)|
| 6:39:03| Hardin Valley and the northwest sector have grown at a rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23943)|
| 6:39:06| that the infrastructure cannot support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23946)|
| 6:39:10| We've been the fastest growing sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23950)|
| 6:39:12| eight out of the last 11 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23952)|
| 6:39:14| with a growth rate of 3.9%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23954)|
| 6:39:17| the average being 1.2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23957)|
| 6:39:20| Just a quick review of the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23960)|
| 6:39:22| there were 600 building permits issued in 2017 in our sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23962)|
| 6:39:27| 600 building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23967)|
| 6:39:30| That averages to one dwelling every 32 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23970)|
| 6:39:33| That's not considering multi-unit dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23973)|
| 6:39:37| School numbers, Hardin Valley Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23977)|
| 6:39:40| maximum capacity, 924 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23980)|
| 6:39:44| Last school year, 2017 and 18, they had 1,081 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23984)|
| 6:39:49| They're already estimating 1,144 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23989)|
| 6:39:54| Hardin Valley Middle School, maximum capacity is 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23994)|
| 6:39:58| We don't know where they're going to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=23998)|
| 6:40:00| They tentatively, when they first started building the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24000)|
| 6:40:03| set around 800 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24003)|
| 6:40:05| School board has already said that's going to be way too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24005)|
| 6:40:10| Hardin Valley Academy, maximum capacity, 860 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24010)|
| 6:40:14| Last year, 2,023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24014)|
| 6:40:17| Next year, they're estimating 2,077.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24017)|
| 6:40:20| We have nine new subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24020)|
| 6:40:22| and three new apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24022)|
| 6:40:24| already either approved or underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24024)|
| 6:40:27| Those children in those homes and apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24027)|
| 6:40:30| aren't factored into those numbers yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24030)|
| 6:40:32| because they haven't been finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24032)|
| 6:40:38| They're using a number per house of 0.4 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24038)|
| 6:40:43| They're using a county-wide number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24043)|
| 6:40:45| when they're talking about impact factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24045)|
| 6:40:48| onto the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24048)|
| 6:40:51| Nobody moves to Hardin Valley because it's pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24051)|
| 6:40:54| People are moving to Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24054)|
| 6:40:56| because of the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24056)|
| 6:40:58| Families are relocating to Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24058)|
| 6:41:00| because of the school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24060)|
| 6:41:01| We have over 20 children under the age of 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24061)|
| 6:41:05| in the six houses at the base of the cul-de-sac I live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24065)|
| 6:41:08| We're a whole lot higher than 0.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24068)|
| 6:41:11| Currently, there's an additional combined 265 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24071)|
| 6:41:15| of multi-acreage parcel land for sale in the Northwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24075)|
| 6:41:19| If all of this ends up getting rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24079)|
| 6:41:21| you're talking about over 800 more homes going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24081)|
| 6:41:25| not considering apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24085)|
| 6:41:27| We have to start slowing things down a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24087)|
| 6:41:29| to see what the effects are based on what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24089)|
| 6:41:33| already under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24093)|
| 6:41:36| The HVPA is looking at a number of different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24096)|
| 6:41:40| the HVPA is working hard to create a balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24100)|
| 6:41:43| of residential, commercial, and community assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24103)|
| 6:41:45| that will make Hardin Valley a great place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24105)|
| 6:41:48| to continue raising families and living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24108)|
| 6:41:51| Growth is beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24111)|
| 6:41:53| And the area does need to be looked at as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24113)|
| 6:41:56| not just individual neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24116)|
| 6:41:58| We understand that they've put money into stubbing a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24118)|
| 6:42:01| but there are other factors that need to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24121)|
| 6:42:04| before you allow further development to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24124)|
| 6:42:07| In August, the Transportation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24127)|
| 6:42:09| is going to be starting a new traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24129)|
| 6:42:11| to update the 1998 version that they're currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24131)|
| 6:42:15| basing their studies on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24135)|
| 6:42:17| We need to let that happen and get things under control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24137)|
| 6:42:21| with the infrastructure before we allow further development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24141)|
| 6:42:25| We're currently working with the Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24145)|
| 6:42:27| trying to come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24147)|
| 6:42:28| We're trying to partner with some of the builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24148)|
| 6:42:30| to try to create some positive karma to help development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24150)|
| 6:42:35| grow in a beneficial way that'll benefit everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24155)|
| 6:42:43| Respectfully, the MPC and the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24163)|
| 6:42:46| have the difficult and very late tonight job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24166)|
| 6:42:49| of being the gateway for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24169)|
| 6:42:52| We are imploring that you uphold the denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24172)|
| 6:42:55| of the Ball Homes purchase of Bryant Road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24175)|
| 6:42:58| Allow our community the opportunity to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24178)|
| 6:43:00| with everyone involved to create a safe, healthy environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24180)|
| 6:43:04| for the residents of Hardin Valley and the Northwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24184)|
| 6:43:09| Smarter growth, better communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24189)|
| 6:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24192)|
| 6:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24193)|
| 6:43:18| Yes, sir, if you would please give your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24198)|
| 6:43:20| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24200)|
| 6:43:21| Anthony Wise, 8111 Robbins Nest Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24201)|
| 6:43:26| I am president of Pellissippi State Community College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24206)|
| 6:43:28| and just want to echo some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24208)|
| 6:43:31| Like many who live and work in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24211)|
| 6:43:33| I have concerns about the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24213)|
| 6:43:35| and congestion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24215)|
| 6:43:38| The college has been interested in the property since 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24218)|
| 6:43:42| and expressed that through its master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24222)|
| 6:43:44| and through a request that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24224)|
| 6:43:46| by the State Building Commission at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24226)|
| 6:43:50| We're still interested and would purchase at the appraised price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24230)|
| 6:43:54| if the appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24234)|
| 6:43:57| I think that commitment is in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24237)|
| 6:43:59| That's really all I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24239)|
| 6:44:02| is that it's something we've been interested in a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24242)|
| 6:44:06| and would purchase it from the owners if the appeal were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24246)|
| 6:44:15| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24255)|
| 6:44:24| One of the speakers referenced road work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24264)|
| 6:44:27| and road planning for Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24267)|
| 6:44:29| Mr. Hickey has met with Mr. Vanderveet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24269)|
| 6:44:33| and other people at Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24273)|
| 6:44:36| to discuss needed road improvements in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24276)|
| 6:44:40| and they are in the planning stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24280)|
| 6:44:43| and will be proceeding forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24283)|
| 6:44:45| I would defer to Mr. Vanderveet who can brief you on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24285)|
| 6:44:50| if you all have questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24290)|
| 6:44:53| Basically, the argument is let's stop everything in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24293)|
| 6:44:58| until we get the infrastructure where we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24298)|
| 6:45:05| Frankly, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24305)|
| 6:45:06| it's always been growth that has pushed infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24306)|
| 6:45:11| Why are you building a new school in Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24311)|
| 6:45:14| Because there's been a lot of development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24314)|
| 6:45:16| Why are you building a new school at Gibbs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24316)|
| 6:45:20| Because there's been a lot of development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24320)|
| 6:45:23| Why do you build new schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24323)|
| 6:45:26| Because there's been pressure from development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24326)|
| 6:45:28| That's how Knox County and every community I'm familiar with works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24328)|
| 6:45:37| In this case, they're asking us or you all to hold us hostage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24337)|
| 6:45:43| even though the MPC staff said the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24343)|
| 6:45:48| at the recommended density is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24348)|
| 6:45:53| is consistent with other zoning and development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24353)|
| 6:46:01| is located in the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24361)|
| 6:46:04| and is proposed for low-density residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24364)|
| 6:46:07| and is compatible with the scale and intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24367)|
| 6:46:11| of the surrounding development and zoning pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24371)|
| 6:46:14| and is appropriate to be developed under the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24374)|
| 6:46:19| Ball Homes wants to build 43 homes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24379)|
| 6:46:24| It's about 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24384)|
| 6:46:27| So actually, it's a little less than four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24387)|
| 6:46:30| It's about 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24390)|
| 6:46:35| And that takes, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24395)|
| 6:46:37| MPC staff said even considering the hillside slope protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24397)|
| 6:46:44| property could be zoned up to 4.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24404)|
| 6:46:47| But Ball Homes has a way of developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24407)|
| 6:46:51| that is obviously very popular with homeowners in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24411)|
| 6:46:55| because most of their homes are sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24415)|
| 6:46:58| as soon as they start coming out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24418)|
| 6:47:01| So we would ask that you all grant the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24421)|
| 6:47:05| and approve planned residential at 3.5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24425)|
| 6:47:10| which will be consistent with what Ball Homes wants to build on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24430)|
| 6:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24436)|
| 6:47:17| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24437)|
| 6:47:19| Mr. Fraser, could you come back down if you don't mind, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24439)|
| 6:47:28| So, yeah, you know, I've had meetings with MPC and part of the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24448)|
| 6:47:33| and I guess my concern is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24453)|
| 6:47:38| if we do stop development until we realize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24458)|
| 6:47:41| I mean, let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24461)|
| 6:47:44| We're working on a road plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24464)|
| 6:47:46| that we have yet to complete three projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24466)|
| 6:47:49| that are in Mayor or County Executive Shumpert's plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24469)|
| 6:47:55| So we haven't finished road work that started in 1980-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24475)|
| 6:48:00| And we have grown to the capacity of where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24480)|
| 6:48:05| You know, Hardin Valley's had an extensive amount of capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24485)|
| 6:48:10| And so if we stop growth in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24490)|
| 6:48:13| I have a hard time coming to the rest of this commission and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24493)|
| 6:48:16| put us up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24496)|
| 6:48:17| You know, we approved a plan today for that study that we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24497)|
| 6:48:23| That's going to cost us a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24503)|
| 6:48:25| It's going to cost us a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24505)|
| 6:48:26| But I think it's a wise study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24506)|
| 6:48:28| Well, if we stop development in Hardin Valley, we don't need that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24508)|
| 6:48:31| because we're just like Powell High School and Powell Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24511)|
| 6:48:36| who's been in portables for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24516)|
| 6:48:38| Where Hardin Valley becomes no different than anybody else in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24518)|
| 6:48:42| Everybody has a capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24522)|
| 6:48:44| Everybody is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24524)|
| 6:48:45| And so if you stop what you're doing, you're at the back of the line again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24525)|
| 6:48:50| I'm pretty sure I didn't hear anybody say we want you to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24530)|
| 6:48:53| We do want you to pump the brakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24533)|
| 6:48:54| We do want you to have planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24534)|
| 6:48:56| That's why we have a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24536)|
| 6:48:58| is to hear all of our concerns about the schools, about the traffic, to get data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24538)|
| 6:49:04| If we haven't even started the study yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24544)|
| 6:49:06| how do we know how many more homes that traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24546)|
| 6:49:10| How do we know what needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24550)|
| 6:49:11| Until that study is done, you can make more informed decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24551)|
| 6:49:14| That's what planned growth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24554)|
| 6:49:16| That's what the planning commission heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24556)|
| 6:49:18| That's what they considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24558)|
| 6:49:19| There was tons of evidence in the record as to why they might say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24559)|
| 6:49:25| to a section of land right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24565)|
| 6:49:28| hearing how many other have been approved in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24568)|
| 6:49:30| Five, six hundred building permits that have already...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24570)|
| 6:49:32| That's not stopped growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24572)|
| 6:49:34| Well, five or six hundred, most of those are apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24574)|
| 6:49:40| Gerald, are those one unit per...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24580)|
| 6:49:41| So one construction permit unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24581)|
| 6:49:43| I don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24583)|
| 6:49:45| But I mean, when you approve an apartment is a 200-unit apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24585)|
| 6:49:48| is that 200 residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24588)|
| 6:49:49| That's counted as 200 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24589)|
| 6:49:51| Okay, so apartments yield an extremely low amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24591)|
| 6:49:55| You've got some in the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24595)|
| 6:49:58| But the group has told me, several people in the group have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24598)|
| 6:50:01| we want to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24601)|
| 6:50:03| If you stop, you're no different than Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24603)|
| 6:50:05| you're no different than anybody else in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24605)|
| 6:50:08| because everybody has capacity issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24608)|
| 6:50:13| And so, I mean, to die on this hill of 41 houses or 15 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24613)|
| 6:50:18| is a little difficult whenever there's 400 acres right down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24618)|
| 6:50:22| that I don't think will ever get rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24622)|
| 6:50:24| because the farmers don't want to lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24624)|
| 6:50:25| But I mean, there's so much that's already been done in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24625)|
| 6:50:30| it's hard for the rest of the commission to comprehend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24630)|
| 6:50:35| why is all that money going down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24635)|
| 6:50:36| Well, if you stop, it'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24636)|
| 6:50:38| I can promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24638)|
| 6:50:39| I understand the need for this board to balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24639)|
| 6:50:42| taxpayer revenue with capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24642)|
| 6:50:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24645)|
| 6:50:46| The other piece of this, it isn't that big of a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24646)|
| 6:50:50| is that nobody from the county has explained to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24650)|
| 6:50:53| when they're going to work with Pellissippi to create this greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24653)|
| 6:50:56| when they're going to work to create these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24656)|
| 6:50:58| that have been promised in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24658)|
| 6:51:01| when the president of Pellissippi is telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24661)|
| 6:51:03| they've been trying to buy this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24663)|
| 6:51:04| and they're prepared to buy it right now for that very purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24664)|
| 6:51:09| When the planning commission heard that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24669)|
| 6:51:11| they took heed of that and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24671)|
| 6:51:13| we need to back up and we need to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24673)|
| 6:51:15| what's going on here before we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24675)|
| 6:51:17| There's ample evidence in the record for them to deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24677)|
| 6:51:21| and we're simply asking that you uphold their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24681)|
| 6:51:24| We're not suggesting that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24684)|
| 6:51:26| this group is not suggesting that you stop growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24686)|
| 6:51:29| and if that's been said, I would agree with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24689)|
| 6:51:31| that that's not really an effective way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24691)|
| 6:51:35| Why don't you answer those questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24695)|
| 6:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24696)|
| 6:51:36| We still have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24696)|
| 6:51:37| Yeah, we still have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24697)|
| 6:51:38| I mean, when we're asking questions, there's no time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24698)|
| 6:51:40| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24700)|
| 6:51:42| But, you know, that's the struggle I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24702)|
| 6:51:45| is that it comes right off of another subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24705)|
| 6:51:49| and, I mean, it just seems like such a small piece of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24709)|
| 6:51:56| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24716)|
| 6:51:57| Walsh is more prepared than I am to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24717)|
| 6:51:59| Can I let her answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24719)|
| 6:52:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24720)|
| 6:52:00| I wouldn't say I'm super prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24720)|
| 6:52:03| I just had a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24723)|
| 6:52:04| My name is Dawn Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24724)|
| 6:52:05| I reside at 4721 Gwinn Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24725)|
| 6:52:09| So this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24729)|
| 6:52:11| yeah, in the big scheme of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24731)|
| 6:52:13| it's not going to add a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24733)|
| 6:52:15| but I think, and y'all correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24735)|
| 6:52:18| but this piece of property right here is part of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24738)|
| 6:52:21| that can be used for a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24741)|
| 6:52:24| And so that could potentially connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24744)|
| 6:52:27| all the way down the Steel Road to Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24747)|
| 6:52:31| And so if this is taken by a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24751)|
| 6:52:34| that just makes that land unavailable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24754)|
| 6:52:37| Everything on Hardin Valley from Steel Road here to Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24757)|
| 6:52:40| is connected by a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24760)|
| 6:52:42| Well, but part of a greenway system that Brad was discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24762)|
| 6:52:48| How would it go through Brighton Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24768)|
| 6:52:50| in the immediate west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24770)|
| 6:52:51| Well, there's no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24771)|
| 6:52:54| That's where the implementation of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24774)|
| 6:52:57| that's what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24777)|
| 6:52:59| I don't have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24779)|
| 6:53:00| I'm just trying to point out some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24780)|
| 6:53:02| The plan was developed to connect potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24782)|
| 6:53:06| in the long-term future Oak Ridge, Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24786)|
| 6:53:10| Knox County, go into Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24790)|
| 6:53:12| That's a long-term plan that's not even remotely funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24792)|
| 6:53:16| I mean, we're not even building roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24796)|
| 6:53:17| I would tell you we're probably not going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24797)|
| 6:53:19| any greenways outside of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24799)|
| 6:53:21| unless it's donated right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24801)|
| 6:53:23| If somebody comes in and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24803)|
| 6:53:24| hey, we'll donate this right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24804)|
| 6:53:25| put asphalt on it, hey, that's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24805)|
| 6:53:28| But the county right now is not building enough road capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24808)|
| 6:53:30| much less greenway capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24810)|
| 6:53:33| And so that's an issue that we've discussed for a long...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24813)|
| 6:53:37| I've tried to say, hey, we're well behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24817)|
| 6:53:41| I mean, I've been that guy that said we're not doing enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24821)|
| 6:53:44| But I don't know that this small piece of the puzzle is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24824)|
| 6:53:51| I mean, I don't know where you would get a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24831)|
| 6:53:53| I mean, the only place you could go from this is Sam Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24833)|
| 6:53:57| because everything else is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24837)|
| 6:53:59| and connected with a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24839)|
| 6:54:01| Like I said, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24841)|
| 6:54:03| I don't know how to design a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24843)|
| 6:54:05| I'm just pointing out that Pellissippi has offered to buy this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24845)|
| 6:54:08| and they've been trying to buy it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24848)|
| 6:54:12| There wasn't clear title on it until recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24852)|
| 6:54:14| And I'm overstepping with what Brad has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24854)|
| 6:54:16| and I certainly at this hour do not want to prolong anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24856)|
| 6:54:20| We just felt like it was errantly zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24860)|
| 6:54:22| out of the technology overlay as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24862)|
| 6:54:24| You know, the whole purpose of the technology corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24864)|
| 6:54:27| was to, quote, design, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24867)|
| 6:54:30| is designed to encourage technology and related land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24870)|
| 6:54:33| while preserving the area's forested ridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24873)|
| 6:54:36| rolling hills, and broad valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24876)|
| 6:54:37| It's already been zoned out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24877)|
| 6:54:38| That's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24878)|
| 6:54:40| But what we were told there, you need to take that to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24880)|
| 6:54:44| We took it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24884)|
| 6:54:46| Okay, we need to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24886)|
| 6:54:47| So now we're here and we're just asking you to uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24887)|
| 6:54:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24892)|
| 6:54:56| Mr. Brownlee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24896)|
| 6:54:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24897)|
| 6:54:58| I have a question for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24898)|
| 6:55:04| In April of 2017, I sold some property to Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24904)|
| 6:55:08| Does that prohibit me from voting on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24908)|
| 6:55:14| I'd need to know a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24914)|
| 6:55:16| What do you need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24916)|
| 6:55:18| Was there a piece of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24918)|
| 6:55:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24920)|
| 6:55:22| I don't think you stand to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24922)|
| 6:55:26| the determination needs to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24926)|
| 6:55:27| whether you stand to benefit financially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24927)|
| 6:55:29| from your vote on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24929)|
| 6:55:30| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24930)|
| 6:55:32| And I'm exercising my right as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24932)|
| 6:55:35| That doesn't constitute conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24935)|
| 6:55:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24936)|
| 6:55:39| Ma'am, you can't speak from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24939)|
| 6:55:41| You have to come up to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24941)|
| 6:55:45| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24945)|
| 6:55:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24947)|
| 6:55:48| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24948)|
| 6:55:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24949)|
| 6:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24950)|
| 6:55:51| It says the commission denied this eight to five, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24951)|
| 6:55:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24957)|
| 6:55:58| What did the staff recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24958)|
| 6:56:01| Staff recommended approval at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24961)|
| 6:56:05| So the property owner is within his rights to request this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24965)|
| 6:56:11| And your feeling of the staff then being educated planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24971)|
| 6:56:18| saw no really problem with this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24978)|
| 6:56:23| Well, as you know, sometimes the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24983)|
| 6:56:27| both this commission and the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24987)|
| 6:56:29| agree with staff and sometimes they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24989)|
| 6:56:32| Staff presents a recommendation based on the best information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24992)|
| 6:56:35| available to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24995)|
| 6:56:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24997)|
| 6:56:38| Just wanted to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24998)|
| 6:56:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=24999)|
| 6:56:40| Can I have a quick question for the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25000)|
| 6:56:45| If this was in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25005)|
| 6:56:49| are we setting ourself up for a lawsuit by denying it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25009)|
| 6:56:56| I don't quite understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25016)|
| 6:57:00| I'll come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25020)|
| 6:57:01| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25021)|
| 6:57:02| Good morning, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25022)|
| 6:57:07| This is for President Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25027)|
| 6:57:16| When you started on your mission over six years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25036)|
| 6:57:19| to have the state building committee purchase this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25039)|
| 6:57:23| or get the funding for it, what was the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25043)|
| 6:57:26| Recreational use, which is probably still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25046)|
| 6:57:29| We've got some significant changes in the Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25049)|
| 6:57:31| like everything else in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25051)|
| 6:57:33| We've grown over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25053)|
| 6:57:34| We've got a new building coming online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25054)|
| 6:57:35| There'll probably be some movement of some resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25055)|
| 6:57:38| but primarily recreational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25058)|
| 6:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25060)|
| 6:57:40| Because I realize, I mean, the state building commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25060)|
| 6:57:44| does not act with lightning speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25064)|
| 6:57:47| So that's why I can see why it took so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25067)|
| 6:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25071)|
| 6:57:52| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25072)|
| 6:57:54| I want to cut to the chase because I'm anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25074)|
| 6:57:57| Arthur's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25077)|
| 6:58:00| And I would advise commission whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25080)|
| 6:58:03| Pellissippi State Community College wants to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25083)|
| 6:58:05| this property or not is not an appropriate consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25085)|
| 6:58:10| and should not in any way enter into this commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25090)|
| 6:58:15| decision on the matter of rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25095)|
| 6:58:18| No, my question was because they had interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25098)|
| 6:58:21| That's why originally in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25101)|
| 6:58:23| and that's why I wanted to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25103)|
| 6:58:24| what their original interest was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25104)|
| 6:58:26| Mr. Nostrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25106)|
| 6:58:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25108)|
| 6:58:29| And to Daniel's point, you know, the awkwardness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25109)|
| 6:58:32| is that with this particular decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25112)|
| 6:58:34| it feels a little bit like we're trying to pick a winner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25114)|
| 6:58:37| when really I get it, Pellissippi State's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25117)|
| 6:58:40| in this should have nothing to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25120)|
| 6:58:42| This should just be, we've had something appealed to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25122)|
| 6:58:46| and do we grant the appeal or not grant the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25126)|
| 6:58:49| I tend to look at appeals a little bit harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25129)|
| 6:58:52| than just a traditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25132)|
| 6:58:55| So I guess, Arthur, you know, you're telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25135)|
| 6:59:01| to go with what the staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25141)|
| 6:59:03| Is there, have you seen any specific error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25143)|
| 6:59:06| or anything that is related to what the MPC Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25146)|
| 6:59:10| has sent to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25150)|
| 6:59:12| Frankly, the commission never gave a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25152)|
| 6:59:17| This was a meeting where I think there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25157)|
| 6:59:20| four or five zonings in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25160)|
| 6:59:22| I think there were four or five zonings in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25162)|
| 6:59:25| There was a big crowd there, much bigger than tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25165)|
| 6:59:29| They passed one over on Coward Mill Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25169)|
| 6:59:31| and then voted against all the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25171)|
| 6:59:34| even though MPC staff had recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25174)|
| 6:59:38| all of the others, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25178)|
| 6:59:41| And it was a strange meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25181)|
| 6:59:46| My clients even, we considered whether we should ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25186)|
| 6:59:49| Was it stranger than tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25189)|
| 6:59:53| Similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25193)|
| 6:59:54| There's some similarities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25194)|
| 6:59:56| And we considered postponing at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25196)|
| 6:59:59| because it was obvious what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25199)|
| 7:00:03| They were denying anything in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25203)|
| 7:00:06| but we went ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25206)|
| 7:00:07| Should have, I should have postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25207)|
| 7:00:12| Never got a good reason other than stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25212)|
| 7:00:16| pull up the drawbridge, let's stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25216)|
| 7:00:19| until you've built the greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25219)|
| 7:00:22| built the roads, and done everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25222)|
| 7:00:27| And I might point out, suddenly the impression is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25227)|
| 7:00:32| if these 43 lots are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25232)|
| 7:00:35| there will be houses being built there tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25235)|
| 7:00:38| These subdivisions take years to build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25238)|
| 7:00:42| And we probably won't even be building these houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25242)|
| 7:00:45| until 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25245)|
| 7:00:47| What, at least three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25247)|
| 7:00:49| Two or three years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25249)|
| 7:00:50| So in the meantime, you all in Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25250)|
| 7:00:55| are certainly addressing the issues that growth brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25255)|
| 7:01:05| Not only in Hardin Valley, but throughout Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25265)|
| 7:01:08| as you all are charged to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25268)|
| 7:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25270)|
| 7:01:12| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25272)|
| 7:01:13| I guess this is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25273)|
| 7:01:15| We keep hearing about the park, the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25275)|
| 7:01:18| Are we required, even in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25278)|
| 7:01:20| we're not required to do a greenway, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25280)|
| 7:01:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25284)|
| 7:01:25| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25285)|
| 7:01:29| Sir, would you like to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25289)|
| 7:01:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25290)|
| 7:01:32| My name is Charles Fiegerle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25292)|
| 7:01:34| I'm from 2451 Bryant Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25294)|
| 7:01:37| Live right adjacent to, as part of Connish Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25297)|
| 7:01:41| I want to add on a couple of things that are sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25301)|
| 7:01:43| I was part of that meeting in terms of both meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25303)|
| 7:01:46| that were held in terms of Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25306)|
| 7:01:48| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25308)|
| 7:01:49| And maybe provide a little bit of perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25309)|
| 7:01:51| on a couple of things that happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25311)|
| 7:01:54| Even though the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25314)|
| 7:01:57| from Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25317)|
| 7:01:59| did come through in terms of recommending four units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25319)|
| 7:02:03| there were some errors in the data there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25323)|
| 7:02:05| And one of the areas that was pointed out earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25325)|
| 7:02:07| was this business about what was the estimation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25327)|
| 7:02:10| of the impact that was going to be on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25330)|
| 7:02:13| The staff data that was there was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25333)|
| 7:02:15| on this 0.4 students per, or children per dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25335)|
| 7:02:20| And it was clear that in terms of Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25340)|
| 7:02:22| that was not what was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25342)|
| 7:02:25| You heard some very impassioned pleas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25345)|
| 7:02:28| by some of the residents over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25348)|
| 7:02:30| about what was the impact already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25350)|
| 7:02:32| in terms of these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25352)|
| 7:02:33| Where children are sitting there on the floor eating lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25353)|
| 7:02:38| because they don't have chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25358)|
| 7:02:39| There's not enough space in the schools already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25359)|
| 7:02:42| Are you going to continue to push this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25362)|
| 7:02:44| to where you have whole classes now not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25364)|
| 7:02:47| being able to end up sitting down in terms of the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25367)|
| 7:02:51| And so that was one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25371)|
| 7:02:53| that affected the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25373)|
| 7:02:57| Another one was the traffic problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25377)|
| 7:03:00| that exists on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25380)|
| 7:03:02| How bad has it got to be before something has to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25382)|
| 7:03:07| I can envision that you're going to get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25387)|
| 7:03:09| where it's going to take you 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25389)|
| 7:03:11| just to be able to get out of your subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25391)|
| 7:03:13| because you can't get out onto Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25393)|
| 7:03:16| And one of the residents over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25396)|
| 7:03:20| made a comment about he is scared every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25400)|
| 7:03:23| his 16-year-old daughter has to drive on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25403)|
| 7:03:27| What are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25407)|
| 7:03:27| And how many children do you have to get killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25407)|
| 7:03:30| before it ends up something happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25410)|
| 7:03:32| And so that was the reasons that some of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25412)|
| 7:03:35| why the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25415)|
| 7:03:37| acted the way they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25417)|
| 7:03:39| They heard the neighborhood and their fears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25419)|
| 7:03:41| and what was going on in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25421)|
| 7:03:43| And so it wasn't just what the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25423)|
| 7:03:46| The staff didn't see all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25426)|
| 7:03:47| They didn't hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25427)|
| 7:03:49| The Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25429)|
| 7:03:50| acted based upon what it heard from the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25430)|
| 7:04:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25440)|
| 7:04:04| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25444)|
| 7:04:05| My name is Minky Fiegerle, and I am his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25445)|
| 7:04:09| And I live at 2451 Bryant Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25449)|
| 7:04:12| 15 years ago, we bought the last piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25452)|
| 7:04:15| in Connors Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25455)|
| 7:04:16| We built our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25456)|
| 7:04:18| It's almost like a private area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25458)|
| 7:04:20| I mean, the way the trees and shrubs and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25460)|
| 7:04:24| line the eastern border, giving us privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25464)|
| 7:04:28| and area for animals and squirrels and rabbits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25468)|
| 7:04:32| and deer and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25472)|
| 7:04:34| Of course, a lot of that now has been taken away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25474)|
| 7:04:37| by their home division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25477)|
| 7:04:43| We built a house that has a basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25483)|
| 7:04:46| And one of my little personal concerns, or ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25486)|
| 7:04:51| is we haven't had one drop of water in that basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25491)|
| 7:04:54| since we've moved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25494)|
| 7:04:55| Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25495)|
| 7:04:57| And I am concerned about what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25497)|
| 7:05:00| going to have to do in order to build their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25500)|
| 7:05:04| and what they're going to do with the beautiful rolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25504)|
| 7:05:07| hills of this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25507)|
| 7:05:09| I know Mr. Brantley knows this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25509)|
| 7:05:12| Do any of you know this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25512)|
| 7:05:15| It's really a special property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25515)|
| 7:05:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25517)|
| 7:05:18| It's just, there's a lot of them in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25518)|
| 7:05:21| It's a beautiful area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25521)|
| 7:05:22| But it's a special piece, piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25522)|
| 7:05:26| Another thing is that my husband's not aware of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25526)|
| 7:05:29| that I talked to a woman that works up at our little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25529)|
| 7:05:33| I call it my Weigel's, but it's the Weigel's nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25533)|
| 7:05:37| And her son's math class was entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25537)|
| 7:05:40| sitting on the floor already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25540)|
| 7:05:43| We're not joking about what's going on in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25543)|
| 7:05:50| I want to talk, I'm not going to talk very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25550)|
| 7:05:52| I mean, I could, but I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25552)|
| 7:05:54| But I do want to mention a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25554)|
| 7:06:00| There was an article in the paper that I read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25560)|
| 7:06:03| about Ball Homes subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25563)|
| 7:06:05| That's on the other side of Connors Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25565)|
| 7:06:08| And he wants to encroach this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25568)|
| 7:06:12| They weren't crazy about his homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25572)|
| 7:06:14| I know the gentleman that represents them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25574)|
| 7:06:17| said how great they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25577)|
| 7:06:18| They have cheap metal windows, according to this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25578)|
| 7:06:21| They have brick fronts and whatever siding on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25581)|
| 7:06:24| Ma'am, you can't attack the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25584)|
| 7:06:26| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25586)|
| 7:06:27| I'm just relating an article that I read, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25587)|
| 7:06:32| It's not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25592)|
| 7:06:33| Well, you know, was it relevant for him to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25593)|
| 7:06:39| how great they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25599)|
| 7:06:41| I mean, you know, they're also a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25601)|
| 7:06:44| that you could borrow a cup of sugar and not leave the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25604)|
| 7:06:47| I mean, the houses are soldier-like, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25607)|
| 7:06:50| One right next to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25610)|
| 7:06:52| And people buy them because of the schools, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25612)|
| 7:06:58| So you have problems with they probably don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25618)|
| 7:07:02| They just think that Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25622)|
| 7:07:03| has these fabulous schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25623)|
| 7:07:05| And maybe 10, 15 years ago, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25625)|
| 7:07:07| But it's become a problem, just like everybody has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25627)|
| 7:07:13| And did you all read the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25633)|
| 7:07:16| that was emailed to you from Amanda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25636)|
| 7:07:21| Are you aware of all of the things that she has found out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25641)|
| 7:07:24| Did you read it carefully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25644)|
| 7:07:27| You know, we're not here because we want to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25647)|
| 7:07:29| at 12, 18 in the morning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25649)|
| 7:07:32| We're here because this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25652)|
| 7:07:34| And the children, they're the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25654)|
| 7:07:36| that are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25656)|
| 7:07:39| And the last thing I'm going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25659)|
| 7:07:43| is that they mentioned a woman whose, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25663)|
| 7:07:46| kids were eating lunch on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25666)|
| 7:07:49| And the one thing she said that's really true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25669)|
| 7:07:52| and I think I need to say it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25672)|
| 7:07:54| is once you start eating on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25674)|
| 7:07:55| you start having health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25675)|
| 7:07:58| And there's no getting around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25678)|
| 7:08:01| So this is what you need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25681)|
| 7:08:04| And one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25684)|
| 7:08:06| I also read, well, this is just a personal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25686)|
| 7:08:11| My homes, great or terrible, whatever, are from Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25691)|
| 7:08:16| And to me personally, you know, it's kind of reprehensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25696)|
| 7:08:21| for me to another company to come from an out-of-state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25701)|
| 7:08:26| and make, at the minimum, $45 million already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25706)|
| 7:08:30| if not probably $100 million already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25710)|
| 7:08:34| And again, that's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25714)|
| 7:08:35| Well, it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25715)|
| 7:08:37| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25717)|
| 7:08:38| It's personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25718)|
| 7:08:39| I know it's personal, that's what makes it irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25719)|
| 7:08:41| I live there, it's my street, and it's very personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25721)|
| 7:08:44| And there are things that you do need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25724)|
| 7:08:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25726)|
| 7:08:48| And I would like to add that I have a son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25728)|
| 7:08:49| that goes to Hardin Valley High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25729)|
| 7:08:51| and I know what the population is like there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25731)|
| 7:09:01| Anybody want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25741)|
| 7:09:03| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25743)|
| 7:09:05| I think the chairman was going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25745)|
| 7:09:09| I mean, we've been under the auspice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25749)|
| 7:09:13| that if it meets the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25753)|
| 7:09:17| and meets the zoning regulations and it gets turned down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25757)|
| 7:09:22| and it goes to circuit court, that it's indefensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25762)|
| 7:09:27| Is that something that you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25767)|
| 7:09:28| Is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25768)|
| 7:09:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25768)|
| 7:09:29| Our office will defend the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25769)|
| 7:09:31| And we pay attention to what's going on in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25771)|
| 7:09:36| If there's something that's indefensible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25776)|
| 7:09:39| likely we will speak up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25779)|
| 7:09:40| but I don't see anything that's indefensible tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25780)|
| 7:09:46| It's not arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25786)|
| 7:09:47| Was that the question you heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25787)|
| 7:09:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25789)|
| 7:09:50| Arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25790)|
| 7:09:57| Somebody want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25797)|
| 7:09:59| Can I ask Mr. Green a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25799)|
| 7:10:02| Mr. Green, what was the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25802)|
| 7:10:03| So that they asked for 5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25803)|
| 7:10:08| and we've had some e-mails that were from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25808)|
| 7:10:12| From the developers asking for a better rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25812)|
| 7:10:15| of development of dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25815)|
| 7:10:17| denials that were from the extreme of deny everything or don't go over three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25817)|
| 7:10:24| What was the discussion of the board, the members, and what ... Did the number get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25824)|
| 7:10:30| to the denial or what it was that got them to the denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25830)|
| 7:10:34| I think what some of the residents stated is the factor that led to the denial is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25834)|
| 7:10:44| The comments from the people in the community about overcrowded schools, the road conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25844)|
| 7:10:51| the lack of parks, the challenge of providing infrastructure to meet the needs of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25851)|
| 7:10:59| that was occurring was what swayed the planning commission and the numbers of people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25859)|
| 7:11:05| Hardin Valley who all had the same message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25865)|
| 7:11:10| I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25870)|
| 7:11:11| It's an overcrowded situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25871)|
| 7:11:14| Carnes Middle School had 1,300, 1,400 kids at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25874)|
| 7:11:19| That's the reason we built Hardin Valley Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25879)|
| 7:11:21| Do we have a capacity issue or do we have a zoning issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25881)|
| 7:11:24| We have a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25884)|
| 7:11:25| We're still pulling kids from Cedar Bluff to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25885)|
| 7:11:30| The kids that live on Reagan, they can hear Carnes High School football players talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25890)|
| 7:11:35| our zone for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25895)|
| 7:11:38| That's not our issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25898)|
| 7:11:40| Zoning is their issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25900)|
| 7:11:47| Everybody has capacity issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25907)|
| 7:11:50| Powell has capacity issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25910)|
| 7:11:55| Halls has capacity issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25915)|
| 7:11:57| Agent Burnett has capacity issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25917)|
| 7:12:02| If we turn down every zoning based on capacity issues, we'll never keep up with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25922)|
| 7:12:13| I totally agree that Hardin Valley has exceeded growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25933)|
| 7:12:19| I totally agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25939)|
| 7:12:24| We have invested, we just voted two months ago to invest $6 or $7 million on Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25944)|
| 7:12:33| interchange at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25953)|
| 7:12:35| We just voted to do Cherahala Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25955)|
| 7:12:39| We just moved Schaefer Road off the exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25959)|
| 7:12:42| We're upgrading Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25962)|
| 7:12:45| Currently it's either closed or soon to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25965)|
| 7:12:49| It's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25969)|
| 7:12:51| All of these projects are in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25971)|
| 7:12:59| Like I said earlier, we're running on a 30 year old road plan and we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25979)|
| 7:13:04| it for four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25984)|
| 7:13:06| I hope that this plan for what Dwight and MPC come up with, but there is so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25986)|
| 7:13:18| I'd love for Pellissippi State to have a piece of property, but we can't consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=25998)|
| 7:13:29| I'm in a quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26009)|
| 7:13:31| Earlier tonight we had 70 people here and we unanimously went against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26011)|
| 7:13:38| The next zoning was very contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26018)|
| 7:13:45| Every time somebody doesn't want a development, do we stop development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26025)|
| 7:13:48| That's the question we've got to ask ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26028)|
| 7:13:50| These are tough decisions we've got to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26030)|
| 7:13:54| I think that's a very difficult position we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26034)|
| 7:14:07| When you make a promise in a plan in 2009 and you make a five year plan promise to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26047)|
| 7:14:13| easements for this greenway, yet you admit in this board that there's no plan to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26053)|
| 7:14:19| now and go ahead and landlock Pellissippi when they're offering to buy it, you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26059)|
| 7:14:25| think that's arbitrary and capricious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26065)|
| 7:14:27| I think that plan that you have is a plan that MPC put together with the community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26067)|
| 7:14:32| engagement as a, if we had the money, this is what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26072)|
| 7:14:36| That's not a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26076)|
| 7:14:38| That is a long-term plan, and as development happens on land, if it fits inside that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26078)|
| 7:14:48| that's a request that can be made to that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26088)|
| 7:14:51| Correct me, Mr. Green, if I'm wrong, but that MPC, that's not a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26091)|
| 7:14:55| That's a desired utopia outcome that we'd love to get to if TDOT funding came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26095)|
| 7:15:02| We don't have the money to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26102)|
| 7:15:05| Is TDOT supposed to pay for a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26105)|
| 7:15:07| Wouldn't that be Parks and Recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26107)|
| 7:15:09| It can be either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26109)|
| 7:15:10| It's in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26110)|
| 7:15:11| Okay, so the residents of this county are not supposed to believe it when you put these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26111)|
| 7:15:16| things down as a five year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26116)|
| 7:15:17| They're just not supposed to believe those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26117)|
| 7:15:19| That sounds arbitrary to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26119)|
| 7:15:21| I don't know if anything in that plan in the last, since it's been open, has even come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26121)|
| 7:15:24| to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26124)|
| 7:15:27| That was a study funded by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26127)|
| 7:15:31| Tell me if I'm wrong, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26131)|
| 7:15:33| It was a study funded by MPC and TDOT as a desired outcome to connect Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26133)|
| 7:15:38| and Blount County through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26138)|
| 7:15:43| I don't know what the Cotter Creek Greenway has to do with the space between Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26143)|
| 7:15:47| State and Hardin Valley Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26147)|
| 7:15:50| Is that part of a bigger plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26150)|
| 7:15:51| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26151)|
| 7:15:52| Yeah, but it's a, as we grow, let's try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26152)|
| 7:15:57| It's not a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26157)|
| 7:15:58| You stated it as a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26158)|
| 7:15:59| It's not a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26159)|
| 7:16:00| Well, okay, I guess when I read something that the county puts out, I assume they intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26160)|
| 7:16:03| to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26163)|
| 7:16:04| And it sounds to me like the county doesn't even intend to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26164)|
| 7:16:06| And they're knowingly, it seems to me like that is enough evidence in the record for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26166)|
| 7:16:10| the MPC that that was part of what they based it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26170)|
| 7:16:14| I would ask you to defer to them and I'll leave it at that, I said 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26174)|
| 7:16:23| I have 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26183)|
| 7:16:24| I sat here all night, I haven't said a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26184)|
| 7:16:25| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26185)|
| 7:16:26| 20 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26186)|
| 7:16:27| Caroline Greenwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26187)|
| 7:16:28| I live in Carnes, 3224 Boomerang Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26188)|
| 7:16:30| Hardin Valley is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26190)|
| 7:16:33| They have a great organization that they've started, the Planning Advocates Group, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26193)|
| 7:16:37| really cares about having development but having smart development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26197)|
| 7:16:40| I don't know if anybody else in the county has done that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26200)|
| 7:16:43| Carnes is getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26203)|
| 7:16:44| We're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26204)|
| 7:16:45| You'll be hearing more from us, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26205)|
| 7:16:48| The thing is that what you've got is an opportunity with them to start doing development differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26208)|
| 7:16:52| The problem, Brad, is that we're not doing sustainable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26212)|
| 7:16:56| We haven't been for so many years that we don't have enough revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26216)|
| 7:17:00| We keep doing this thing where we try to get enough revenue from new development but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26220)|
| 7:17:04| it doesn't pay for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26224)|
| 7:17:05| It pays for a little bit of what you owed 30 years ago but it doesn't pay for what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26225)|
| 7:17:09| developing now and it's not going to catch you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26229)|
| 7:17:11| It's never going to catch you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26231)|
| 7:17:13| So what we have to do is do development basically differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26233)|
| 7:17:16| I don't have all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26236)|
| 7:17:17| I've read a lot of stuff but I don't have all the answers because it depends on where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26237)|
| 7:17:21| you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26241)|
| 7:17:22| Hardin Valley could actually pull off smart development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26242)|
| 7:17:25| You could use it as kind of a pilot community to do this right where you could have in theory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26245)|
| 7:17:31| and it takes you guys supporting it, you could have negotiations with developers over doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26251)|
| 7:17:37| higher density here and getting something there in return and all that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26257)|
| 7:17:41| because you've got some room still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26261)|
| 7:17:43| It's going fast but you've got property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26263)|
| 7:17:45| You could do it differently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26265)|
| 7:17:46| I think MPC, the commissioners, heard that when these people were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26266)|
| 7:17:51| They heard Hardin Valley is a special case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26271)|
| 7:17:54| They've got really bad problems but potential to solve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26274)|
| 7:17:57| They've got this planning advocates group that wants to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26277)|
| 7:18:00| I think that's why you need to look at this case differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26280)|
| 7:18:03| The Pellissippi property, yeah, it's right next to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26283)|
| 7:18:07| That's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26287)|
| 7:18:08| That's here or there in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26288)|
| 7:18:09| I mean it would be nice if they could have it but that's not within the realm of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26289)|
| 7:18:12| you're supposed to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26292)|
| 7:18:13| But it's special in a different case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26293)|
| 7:18:15| It's special because it's the beginning of potentially a very good opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26295)|
| 7:18:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26300)|
| 7:18:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26301)|
| 7:18:27| When we have a appointed board and they do these plans and they put it out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26307)|
| 7:18:37| and they say this is what we would like to do, we get an idea from the community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26317)|
| 7:18:45| that is a promise to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26325)|
| 7:18:49| I have a problem with that when I heard what they were saying back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26329)|
| 7:18:52| This is what was promised to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26332)|
| 7:18:57| We are the legislative body of this county yet we have bureaucrats that's appointed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26337)|
| 7:19:04| offices that put out these plans and then we get to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26344)|
| 7:19:09| Excuse me, those plans are based on the comments from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26349)|
| 7:19:13| They are not provided by the bureaucrats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26353)|
| 7:19:16| The staff prepares the plans based on the input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26356)|
| 7:19:20| I was talking, sir, and I didn't interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26360)|
| 7:19:24| Let me finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26364)|
| 7:19:25| It's late and I wanted to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26365)|
| 7:19:26| I know it's late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26366)|
| 7:19:27| It's not the bureaucrats making the plans, it's the people make the plans, the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26367)|
| 7:19:31| makes the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26371)|
| 7:19:32| Mr. Chairman, would you call this order, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26372)|
| 7:19:35| Yes, continue, Mr. Bussman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26375)|
| 7:19:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26377)|
| 7:19:39| What I'm saying is when the plan goes out there, it's perceived in a different way from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26379)|
| 7:19:49| the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26389)|
| 7:19:51| They think it's a promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26391)|
| 7:19:54| We make the rules up here as the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26394)|
| 7:20:00| What I would like to do to the people out there and just say this, there is money that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26400)|
| 7:20:06| goes, your tax dollars goes in and then somebody has to put it into the budget where it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26406)|
| 7:20:13| to whatever, but it's not a promise, it's not a guarantee when these plans are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26413)|
| 7:20:20| So what I would like to do is let's call a question and see what we're going to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26420)|
| 7:20:24| this vote because it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26424)|
| 7:20:26| We're off topic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26426)|
| 7:20:27| Let's get back to the issue that's before us and that's the appeal of the zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26427)|
| 7:20:32| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26432)|
| 7:20:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26434)|
| 7:20:37| The math problem is what I was wanting a brief recap of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26437)|
| 7:20:43| The request that was denied was for four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26443)|
| 7:20:48| The appeal is saying five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26448)|
| 7:20:51| There's 15 acres at 3.5, there's 52, but somewhere in here I may have heard 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26451)|
| 7:20:59| What is it, if we had a motion before us, what is the number of lots that would be involved in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26459)|
| 7:21:10| Our plan is for 43, 44, 45 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26470)|
| 7:21:20| You've got to pick one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26480)|
| 7:21:22| 45 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26482)|
| 7:21:26| That's how many acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26486)|
| 7:21:29| 43.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26489)|
| 7:21:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26493)|
| 7:21:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26495)|
| 7:21:37| How many acres is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26497)|
| 7:21:39| It's 15.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26499)|
| 7:21:47| Mr. Chair, that's the reason I was not asking for acres or units per acre or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26507)|
| 7:21:53| I wanted to know what the number of lots would be in this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26513)|
| 7:21:59| I get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26519)|
| 7:22:05| We don't have our final plans, but they're looking at 43 to 47 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26525)|
| 7:22:09| 3.5 units per acre would do cover what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26529)|
| 7:22:15| I think Commissioner Wright is wanting a hard number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26535)|
| 7:22:19| Not on the acres, but the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26539)|
| 7:22:24| 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26544)|
| 7:22:26| Come up here, Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26546)|
| 7:22:31| Ryan Hickey, Ball Homes, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26551)|
| 7:22:36| I guess, obviously, we haven't finished a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26556)|
| 7:22:41| We do have a preliminary one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26561)|
| 7:22:43| It shows 43 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26563)|
| 7:22:45| That changes up or down some, so I think at this point I'd be fine with 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26565)|
| 7:22:53| 48 lots, if you want a maximum lot count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26573)|
| 7:22:57| Sir, I heard him say 43, and then I heard him say 45, and then he said 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26577)|
| 7:23:03| Now you're saying 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26583)|
| 7:23:05| I guess my question is, are you wanting a hard number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26585)|
| 7:23:11| We're going to have a motion in a moment, and rather than saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26591)|
| 7:23:17| Well, is it 15 acres or 16 or 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26597)|
| 7:23:20| Is it 3, is it 4, is it 5, is it 3.75?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26600)|
| 7:23:24| Just how many lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26604)|
| 7:23:26| And if you were saying 43, that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26606)|
| 7:23:30| If you're saying 47, well, that was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26610)|
| 7:23:43| 45 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26623)|
| 7:23:46| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26626)|
| 7:23:48| I was not interested in making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26628)|
| 7:23:51| I was just wanting to know, if a motion ever gets here, what was the number going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26631)|
| 7:23:57| There's no place to place it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26637)|
| 7:24:07| Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26647)|
| 7:24:09| I just want to, so the residents that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26649)|

| 7:29:34| they set it up in their main assembly over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26974)|

| 7:29:57| And who's our chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26997)|
| 7:29:58| Do we have a chair on our side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=26998)|

| 7:30:52| it they asked that somebody come up with, not the committee, but put a committee together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27052)|
| 7:31:01| to form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27061)|
| 7:31:03| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27063)|
| 7:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27064)|
| 7:31:05| I am going to appoint five people to be on that committee to set up the guidelines and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27065)|
| 7:31:11| the rules for that committee, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27071)|
| 7:31:13| Nobody get upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27073)|
| 7:31:14| I'm doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27074)|
| 7:31:15| There's a system to this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27075)|
| 7:31:16| First, I'm going to get three people that are very active in the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27076)|
| 7:31:22| in Nashville and that would be Bussler, Daley, and Schoonmaker and then I want to throw them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27082)|
| 7:31:28| our two most experienced commissioners to help them set up the rules and stuff and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27088)|
| 7:31:35| would be Brad and Dave, if you all are willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27095)|
| 7:31:40| Are you willing, Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27100)|
| 7:31:42| Is this committee going to be on and on and on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27102)|
| 7:31:47| Yes, because you don't have any women on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27107)|
| 7:31:50| It's not about women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27110)|
| 7:31:53| These two are the most experienced legislators we have on this board and these three are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27113)|
| 7:31:59| the ones that go to most of the stuff in Nashville and the conferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27119)|
| 7:32:04| We do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27124)|
| 7:32:05| I'm just making that observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27125)|
| 7:32:07| Does anybody want to let Evelyn have her seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27127)|
| 7:32:10| She can have my seat because I'm campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27130)|
| 7:32:15| Because you're campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27135)|
| 7:32:16| That's why I wanted to ask because I know you're busy, but that puts a lot more on Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27136)|
| 7:32:21| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27141)|
| 7:32:22| He's got big shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27142)|
| 7:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27144)|
| 7:32:25| You guys need to figure out when you're going to meet to start to put this committee information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27145)|
| 7:32:30| and the process together, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27150)|
| 7:32:33| We got one more item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27153)|
| 7:32:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27155)|
| 7:32:36| Mr. Chairman, since we got our five, Mr. Law Director, can we go ahead and point a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27156)|
| 7:32:40| chair for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27160)|
| 7:32:44| Your chairman has said call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27164)|
| 7:32:46| That means you all have to get with Drew and schedule your meeting at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27166)|
| 7:32:53| She can sunshine it and you all can elect whoever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27173)|
| 7:32:56| I think it would be appropriate if the chair called the meeting, started the meeting, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27176)|
| 7:32:59| then set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27179)|
| 7:33:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27180)|
| 7:33:01| Mr. Chair, you set the time of meeting and the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27181)|
| 7:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27185)|
| 7:33:07| That's the reason I was asking if we had somebody who's going to be the lead to set the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27187)|
| 7:33:12| up is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27192)|
| 7:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27193)|
| 7:33:14| But don't make that decision at 1245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27194)|
| 7:33:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27195)|
| 7:33:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27196)|
| 7:33:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27197)|
| 7:33:18| We need to avoid decisions at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27198)|
| 7:33:19| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27199)|

| 7:33:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27206)|

| 7:33:37| Pike, which would allow for the realignment of Fairview Road as it crosses Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27217)|

| 7:33:48| I've been speaking to TDOT and to Mr. Snowden about when might the state be interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27228)|
| 7:33:55| dealing with this, and I get sort of a response that maybe a unanimous resolution from county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27235)|
| 7:34:03| commission might assist the state in seeing there's emphasis in Knox County that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27243)|
| 7:34:10| road project might move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27250)|
| 7:34:13| I'm asking this as a discussion item if I could see a show of hands who would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27253)|
| 7:34:19| this if I were to bring a resolution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27259)|
| 7:34:23| It's not a, it's no money, it's no, it's nothing except Knox County asking that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27263)|
| 7:34:29| intersection with crash data be looked at and realigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27269)|
| 7:34:36| We have already provided the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180625?start=27276)|
