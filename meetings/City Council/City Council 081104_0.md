| 0:00:06| I want to thank everyone for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6)|
| 0:00:08| We'll ask Ms. Pelo to lead us in the invocation and Mr. Woodhull to lead us in the pledge after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=8)|
| 0:00:15| If you'll all stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=15)|
| 0:00:19| And may we bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=19)|
| 0:00:22| Our Father, we really come before you tonight with praise for this gorgeous day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=22)|
| 0:00:31| It has absolutely been magnificent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| And in that, we see your hand and your creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| Help us to be reminded always that we are stewards of that creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| And may we always serve it in a way that is pleasing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| Today is a very special day in the lives of those of us who live in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=54)|
| 0:01:02| And we pray that your will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| We pray that out of all of the, I guess we have to say God politicking and all that goes on with your people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=67)|
| 0:01:20| we often feel that there's a lot of division and a lot of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| We pray that you will bring our hearts somehow to find unity and peace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| and know that it is you who is in control of our lives and of our destiny if we put our faith in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=95)|
| 0:01:45| So we would pray that you would be with us during this meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| We are so privileged to meet in freedom and the ability to speak our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| and have our own opinions and share them with our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| We pray that you will be with us during this opportunity to share those feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| and that you will guide us safely home. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=127)|

| 0:03:15| That's the property tax freeze since we more than likely don't have an increase coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| I'd like to move to postpone that to the last meeting in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=200)|

| 0:04:06| Secondly, the American Legion Post No. 2 here will have its 83rd Annual Veterans Day Parade this Tuesday, November 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| It starts right down here on 1045 on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| There's a moment of silence at 11 o'clock, and there's free parking available at Civic Coliseum Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| It is a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| I know a lot of you all have participated in that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| The Mercy Health Partners Cross Knox Race, which last year the council had a relay team to complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| the 15K, is set for 830 Saturday, November 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=274)|

| 0:04:52| And finally, of course, this is a very special day, Election Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=292)|

| 0:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I announced, I think it was the last meeting, the first vestal commercial area, redevelopment area, public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| dealing with the design for the commercial area, et cetera, urban design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| and the work that Beth Eason and her architectural firm and Sarah Hedstrom had been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| and David Gamble from Chan Krieger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| That meeting was a great success, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| A lot of folks turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| They were very positive about the work that happened, that was done by those firms and was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| And Ms. Rojera and her department, of course, took a lead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| I just wanted to announce, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I think this coming Monday is the next meeting at 6 o'clock at Vestal United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=356)|
| 0:06:07| the next public meeting where the consultants will come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| and sort of present a revised version based on the feedback they got, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| So I just want to announce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| I think that's the only thing that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Any other reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=382)|

| 0:06:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Resolution A is an appeal by Paul Dickinson, Michael Giardo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| representatives of the historic Gibbs Drive Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| for a retail establishment containing up to 79,599 square feet of floor space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| and the accompanying parking subject to conditions in a PC1 retail and office park district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| property located on the southwest side of North Broadway, north side of Knox Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| in conjunction with Resolution 11P, which is a resolution approving the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=438)|
| 0:07:28| There are several folks that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I think, as counsel knows, let me ask counsel a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| As you know, our rules are that three can speak in favor, three can speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| Each has five minutes to speak, and then there's one two-minute rebuttal for those in favor by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| There are four people signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| You can let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| We can stick to the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| We can ask those four to keep it within the 15-minute time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Is there a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| I guess my tendency would be to let people speak, and if they can, keep it within the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| We'll try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Why don't we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| I'll ask each side to keep their remarks within the total 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Is that okay by common nods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| First up to speak in favor is Connie Cavanaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Ken Cloninger will be after that, and Paul Dickinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Connie, if you could give us your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| If everybody could just give us your name and address when you come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| Connie Cavanaugh, 3002 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| I've been a resident of the historic Gibbs Drive neighborhood for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| On behalf of my neighbors, I would like to thank counsel for the supportive comments that they made at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| We were quite humbled by your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| I do want to be perfectly clear on one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| Our community has been supportive on everything that Kroger wants to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| except the one thing that harms our neighborhood, aligning the entrance with Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| We want Kroger to move to this proposed location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| I shop at Kroger, and I'm excited about having a new Kroger store to go shop at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| The Kroger company has always been good stewards in our community, and I look forward to continuing that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| They do a lot in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| I have been surprised that safety has been the overwhelming reason that Kroger gives for moving the Broadway entrance to align with Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| I, too, am concerned about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I feel that alignment will encourage pedestrians to cross Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| I also believe that the safety of the persons in the crosswalk at Kroger will be compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| A straight shot from Broadway into the right-of-way crosswalk at Kroger is dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and waiting for shoppers in that crosswalk will back up traffic, especially during busy afternoons and holiday seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| There are people in Fountain City who have accused us of standing in the way of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| I'm sorry the community has become divided on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| My neighbors and I chose to speak up because our quality of life is most directly affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Maintaining the charm of Fountain City while welcoming growth is our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| The success of any city with a rich architectural history is in achieving this difficult balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| Too many times we have watched as buildings, homes, and other historically significant areas have been destroyed by progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| There must be a way that we can coexist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| I'm disappointed Kroger did not come back to our neighborhood after the last council meeting with a proposal for compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| We are desperate for any other solution that will give Kroger the flow of traffic that they desire while maintaining the integrity of our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=631)|
| 0:10:40| We do not want the entrance aligned. It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| An offset alignment worked successfully for Target, and we hoped an alternate solution would have been offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| A traffic light proposal was mentioned in the local newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| That is the very thing that we fear most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| If congestion is created, the traffic light will be inevitable in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=658)|
| 0:11:04| Our quiet street will then become a cut-through from the neighborhoods east of Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| Many people want to avoid that Essery Road-Broadway intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| It is a mess, but we do not want to be the cut-through street for that avoidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| We can never go back once that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Please, please do not allow that to happen to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Once again, I'm thankful for the opportunity to voice my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| I beg Kroger to reconsider discontinuing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| My optimistic nature believes a compromise is surely possible so we can all have a better neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| Please, please vote with Gibbs Drive on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=703)|

| 0:11:54| Yes, I'm Ken Cloninger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I live at 2821 Gibbs Drive and have all my entire married life of 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| We've lived in Fountain City, not necessarily at that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| I'd like to introduce my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| These are just the ones on our street now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| We have taken our time many times to come up here because we are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| We are serious about our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Now, there's other people too, all the others that are here supporting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| Now, these live at other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| They're not necessarily Gibbs Drive residents, but they are here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| We have a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| This is just our street, nobody else involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| I'd like someone to pass those out to each council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| All they have is the address and the person that's living there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| There's 44 out of the 52 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| We didn't quite get all of them, but I think it's a pretty good consistent amount of people live on our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=769)|
| 0:13:00| We've all been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| We have lived in Fountain City, like I said, for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| We have been involved in many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| We've done trash pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| We've done the Dogwood Arts Festival every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| We're there for the trick-or-treaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| We're there for Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| We're not against Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| We never have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| We're proud to have Kroger come to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| We embrace them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| We've said this over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| We mean every word we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| But when it came to Kroger getting this variance, it changed the way we were going to do life on Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=824)|
| 0:13:59| They could have gone in there from day one with okay from MPC of the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| They needed no variances whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| They could have used the lot as it is, put the Kroger in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Everything would have been fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| They chose to get the variance, which aligned with our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| And we feel as a whole, not just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| It's not one person or two person or three people on our street saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| We all feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Sooner or later there will be a traffic light at that intersection, and we will be destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| There will be no more walking your dog and riding bicycles or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| The traffic will be just outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| We thought that Kroger, we came up with a few ideas that we thought Kroger would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| They decided not to do that for safety reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| If you create an unsafe situation, then you're going to have to rectify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| You're going to have to put something there to make it safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| and that's why we feel that traffic light is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| I don't know where, I guess because Kroger bluffed into saying they're not going to build there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| it brought on more opposition against our neighborhood, against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| We have been on Gibbs Drive and been involved in the community for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| I think there's been someone from our street that's been on Town Hall's board since the 70s, mid-70s, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=925)|
| 0:15:34| I've been president of Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Town Hall was created for the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| It was to compromise situations where commercial encroached on neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=940)|
| 0:15:49| Town Hall has always been there for the neighborhoods, and we appreciate their support tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| We are there, like I said, for Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| We have always been there, and we patronize these places that are here tonight opposing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| because we're against Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| That's what they bring out over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| We're not against Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| We are just trying to protect our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| If this happened to anyone else, if they put a Kroger across the street from your subdivision anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| or your street anywhere, I dare any of you to say that you would not defend that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| That's where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| We're serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| I wish there was a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| We could come up, we gave them some things of just using the old entrance and let it go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| And nothing would have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| We were here a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| We're back again now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| And if it takes another meeting, we'll do another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| We don't have a lot of time on our street to, I mean, we've lived there a long time, but we've got a lot more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1012)|
| 0:17:07| The other night we had Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And as I sat out there on my porch, we were getting ready for the trick-or-treaters and all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| and we heard car doors and they start lining up down at Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And then the kids start walking up our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| We have 150 on Halloween alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| And I thought to myself, if there were a traffic light down there right tonight, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| how would these kids be able to go door to door safely with traffic constantly going up and down the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| That's how important it is, not just for Halloween, for the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| What would it be like if you had oncoming traffic constantly going to Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| when you've got people trying to drive the Dogwood Trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| There are so many things that I guess need to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| We're not the bad guys in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| We're not here opposing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| We want all nice new things in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| We want all that the people in Fountain City can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| all the new things that they can come up with, the new stores, the new Krogers, the new everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| We enjoy the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| We patronize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| We are part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| To have someone or some group come in and try to divide that community over this alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| which was just ours, it wasn't anyone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| I think that is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| It would destroy our neighborhood for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| I don't know what else to say except, please, in your decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| I'm sure it's going to have to go one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| but at least have it not on your conscience that you destroyed one of the greatest streets in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1133)|
| 0:19:01| in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| And thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1145)|

| 0:19:12| I'm Paul Dickinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I live at 3013 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| I've lived in Fountain City for 25 years, Gibbs Drive almost 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I've taught at Central High School for the past 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| My daughter graduated in 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| My son, God willing, will in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| I would like to begin by addressing the petition that was passed around at Lytton's last Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| It simply stated that it supported Kroger moving into the vacant Target property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| and makes no mention of our one concern, which is aligning their entrance and exit with our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| The problem with the petition is that it lacks factual information about the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| The petition states that several impressive concessions were made by Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| This is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Kroger has said they will put in sidewalks and trees and steps to the skateboard park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| We appreciate and we applaud Kroger's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| Here are the facts, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| Fact one, when Kroger spent $5.7 million on the Target property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| they had all the zoning they needed to open their store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| They bought the property as is without any zoning variances requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| Since then, Kroger has applied for six variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| All have been agreed upon but this one because this one is the one that threatens a neighborhood nearly 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| This one threatens the tranquility of one of the great neighborhoods in Fountain City and Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| This one threatens the property values of 54 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| and this one threatens the safety of 54 families, the citizens of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| And this one breaks the Knox zoning regulation that states that no variances will be granted that are, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1249)|

| 0:21:01| Fact number two, nowhere in the petition does it state that Gibbs Drive has tried to work with Kroger representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| to come up with a plan that is fair to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Nowhere does it state that Gibbs Drive has met with Kroger representatives at least two times to make reasonable requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| Nowhere does it state that Gibbs Drive has been promised two times by Kroger representatives that they'd work something out and get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| Nowhere does it state that neither time has Kroger complied or kept their promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| And nowhere does the petition state that four weeks ago on Tuesday, October 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| when Gibbs Drive and Kroger presented our cases to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| city council members strongly supported Gibbs Drive and told Kroger then to, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| send the bright minds back to the drawing board, end quote, to come up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| In conclusion, Knoxville annually budgets hundreds of thousands of dollars supporting neighborhoods hurt by poorly planned commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1312)|
| 0:22:02| Our neighborhood has existed and thrived for nearly 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| We have well-maintained homes and yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| We're the first street on the Dogwood Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| We welcome the walkers, runners, and bikers, the young, old, and four-legged to enjoy the peace and quiet we value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| And we welcome Kroger into our neighborhood, just like the existing Kroger has welcomed us for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| We do not want to become Knoxville's next revitalization project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Please uphold our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Chris Kirby will speak first for those against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1353)|
| 0:22:45| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Obviously, I'm not Chris Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| My name is Tim McNamara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| I'm the senior real estate manager for the Kroger Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I live in Roswell, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| With me from our project team is Chris Kirby over to my left, and Chris will speak after I get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| I'm not real good at short stories, so hopefully I don't eat up too much of the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1385)|
| 0:23:14| Also with me tonight is my right-hand man, Paul Gianca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Paul's a real estate manager in my department, and Paul's been our point person on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1397)|
| 0:23:26| The first thing I want to do is thank everybody for coming out, everybody who came out tonight, especially those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| I also would like to thank the people that spoke in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| We spent a lot of time putting this deal together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| This goes back three years when Kroger originally bid on the property when Target first pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| We were not the winning bidder at the time, fortunately for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| It did circle back around after the other group could not get the uses they wanted there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| and could not get the zoning they needed to move forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| We were very grateful for that because we've been operating three very old stores along Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| and up into Maynardville Highway and halls, and we've been looking for a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| to try to position one of Kroger's best facilities to serve not only the Fountain City area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| but the areas north and south of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| We're very, very excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| If you look at the three stores that we have currently serving, our greatest asset is our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| But when you have older facilities, smaller facilities, this area deserves so much more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| and that's what we plan to deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| I think you're familiar with our investment of $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| We're going to have a state-of-the-art facility with a drive-through pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| expanded departments, organics, upscale merchandising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| It will have all the bells and whistles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| It will be our largest store in the Knoxville area, our largest store in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| the second largest store in the Knoxville area, second only to the Farragut store we opened here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| We expect to create 100-plus jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| And, you know, this meeting tonight isn't about trying to save some of the mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| This isn't about adding sidewalks on Broadway and Knox Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| This isn't about trying to reuse the target sign, which is of greater height than what the residents really want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| This isn't about using upscale materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| This is about a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| All the other things I mentioned previously, Kroger has already agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| One of the things that Kroger is unwilling to compromise is public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| I've worked for the Kroger company for 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I've developed centers all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| I built the store on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| I expanded Knox Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| The last time it was expanded, and we're planning to expand it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I've done a lot of projects here in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| And any project that we do, the first thing that we do is we line up the access points to allow for safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| convenient movement for our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| We've already compromised on everything that we typically discuss with residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| This is kind of a new deal for me to actually talk about lining up access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| That just creates safe, convenient movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| I've never in all of my dealings on my projects, I've never had anybody challenge an initiative to try to line up the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1603)|
| 0:26:55| With all due respect to the residents on Gibbs Drive, we're not trying to destroy their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| There are many, many prominent streets that line up with other access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| Quite frankly, we don't believe that there's any evidence to really support their case that people are going to cut down Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1631)|
| 0:27:21| In my opinion, if people want to cut down Gibbs Drive, they're already cutting down Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| The mere fact that you have our access point lined up with their street doesn't mean any more people are going to cut down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1647)|
| 0:27:35| than previously would cut down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| We expect this store to be a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| And in doing so, this is going to be a main access point for our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| And we do not want them to be in harm's way by taking a very dangerous movement out of this shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1666)|
| 0:27:55| Chris has put up the, there's an arrow, the current alignment and then the alignment that we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| You can see that if two people, somebody's heading out of Gibbs Drive and wants to head south on North Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| and somebody's pulling out of the center and wants to take a left and head north on North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| there is a conflicting movement there where these two cars, you know, you don't know who has the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| So either in this case you could have a situation, you're more likely to have a head-on collision under this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| So one of the first things that we did actually in site planning this was to line it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| So as you can see on the bottom, when you line this up, you have very safe, convenient movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| because two people, two cars can take left turn movements simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| and not worry about running into each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Again, we do take the position with all due respect to the residents on Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| we appreciate their patronage, we appreciate them as customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| But again, that is not a safe movement to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| And by just lining it up does not mean that more people are going to drive down Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| I don't have any evidence and I don't think they do either to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| Just to keep clock with it, you're five minutes into your 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| I guess I'll just save the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Do I have to save time for rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Actually, by the rules, only those speaking in favor get rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| but my guess is council will have plenty of other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| So my guess is you'll get a chance to say anything you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| because I think there will be questions after it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| I believe I've said everything I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| I thank you for your time and I hope we can count on your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| We're very excited about moving forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| and giving the north Knoxville area a very special store to shop at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| Chris Kirby with Wilbur Smith Associates, 1100 Marion Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| I just want to basically support what Tim has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| We did the traffic impact study for the Kroger development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| As you can see, I just want everybody to be very aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| that the offset alignment that currently exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| does create a greater potential for accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| The alignment of the intersection does remove the conflict that currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| This is important because we believe that the Kroger will bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| different types of trips than the Target did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| You have to understand that a grocery store will create more pass-by trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| You'll be pulling more people out of the stream of Broadway than a Target did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| People going to and from work are going to stop in to the Kroger's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| buy their bread, buy their milk on their way to and from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| This different type of trip is going to create a higher usage of this driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| for trips coming from Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| Therefore, we believe it is very important to make the alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| which will cut down on the potential of having a head-on collision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| To address the cut-through, we would offer this area map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1879)|
| 0:31:30| which was in your previous package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| You can see right now no signal exists at Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| In our study, we found that no signal would be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| We did not make that recommendation whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| You can see that the signals at Knox and Estuary are what Fountainsidians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| currently use to get from Jacksboro Pike to Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| There were extensive counts and studies done throughout the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| to come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Basically, in short, we think that trips from Jacksboro Pike traveling across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| six lanes of traffic on Broadway into the Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| would not be a very attractive movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Thus, we think that people will continue to use the signalized intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| of both Estuary and Renwick and Knox to get to and from the Kroger's primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| and people from Broadway will primarily use that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| as left and right turn movements into the Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| With that, we'd like to respectfully submit that we would completely endorse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| the site design that we analyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| and really believe that it will cut down on the potential for accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1971)|

| 0:32:56| And then Donna Buckman after Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you very much for allowing me to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| My name is Mike Hensley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| My family has been in Fountain City since 1919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| I'm a Fountain City town hall board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| I also have served president of the Fountain Gate Homeowners Association for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| and my son will be a fourth-generation Central High School graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| And it's amazing to sit and listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I've never done this before, but it's amazing to sit and listen to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| and realize that we're just a few feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| I mean, I'm a Fountain City person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I've never met these two gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| I've talked to one of them on the phone before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I've never met either one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| But what started this whole thing was the mere fact that it looked like this project was going away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| and Fountain City could not afford for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| And I'm sure that Knoxville City really would not like for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| And as far as the petition is concerned, I don't disagree with most of the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| I really don't disagree with Gibbs Drive at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I lived on Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| My brother lived on Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| My aunt lived on Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| It's my favorite street in Fountain City is Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| So this is not, and they've made that clear too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| this is not a Gibbs Drive against Kroger's type issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| and that's certainly not what we've tried to incite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| What we've tried to do is I'm here really to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| and represent the 400 people that signed the petition in four days that were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| and everybody will misinterpret, everybody will have their own interpretation of what is actually going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and that's why it's important to have this here tonight so we can all, they're willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| and I'm not going to ask everyone to stand up, but you know the people that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| and you can see the people here versus the Gibbs Road people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| I wish we could all just sit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I think that we should sit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And I really think that I'm hoping that you're all's wisdom and you're all's talents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| in doing the things like this that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| One of the councilors said it's like splitting a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Well, we're really just 50 feet off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| We don't have splitting babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| We've just got to get this thing done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| and we just cannot afford for Kroger's to go walk away in this environment that we're sitting in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| And so that's really the reason I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I am not here to divide whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| And on that petition, the main thing that was kind of left out of the discussion on the Gibbs Road as far as the petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| on that petition was an attachment, was the letter that Kroger's had written to the councilman and to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| saying that they are willing to walk from a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| I'm not a safety engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Thank God one's here, but I'm not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| And so I don't understand anything other than the fact that Fountain City is losing an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| when right next to this property we have agreed, all of Fountain City has agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and Knox County and city has helped us agree to put a skateboard park right up against this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| And we're in the process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| We're going to rebuild that skateboard park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| And this thing sits vacant for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| It will have the exact opposite effect of what we tried to do with this skateboard park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| It is not going to be a safe place for our kids to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| It's going to be a total waste of property, a total waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| And that's as big a sin as anything else in this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| We've got to be more creative than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| And I'm just one of the 400 people that signed this petition here to really not only represent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| but also I want to represent Gibbs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I want to do the right thing by them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| When I say me, I'm speaking to the people that I spoke to in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| This group over here is business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| It's neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| It's citizens of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| And it's not just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| There's even some people over there sitting over there from Gibbs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And it is a shame that it seems to be a division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| It should not be a division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| I think that I do appreciate what Crowbridge has tried to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| I know for a fact that over the months it's taken to get to this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| that many other developers would not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| So that's really the crux of my petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| One thing I do want to say, because one of the councilmen brought it up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| they asked what is the difference between leaving one building vacant versus the other building vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| meaning the two sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| The old Crowbridge is approximately 30,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| This is 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| The old Crowbridge could be developed maybe locally somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| There's no way any local developers are going to develop 80,000 square feet building in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| It's going to sit there vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| This is not the economic time to walk away from these type of opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| So we embrace Crowbridge, but we also just as importantly embrace our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| and embrace the business community, too, and all the neighborhoods in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| And I'm just asking for your all's help in coming up with a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Donna, you guys have about three more minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2233)|
| 0:37:21| Listen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Donna Buckman, 2417 Ridgecrest Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| First, representing Fountain City Connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| I would like to reiterate again the above and beyond nature of the provisions that Kroger has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| with regard to the site plan and the pedestrian accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Given that we have no sidewalk ordinance requiring sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| we must rely on the generosity of the firms to work with us to provide for pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| and Kroger has been very willing to talk with us about accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| I think they have seen our vision of what a village we have in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| and how very important our community is to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Kroger has jumped through many hoops in getting this site plan ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| They added the sidewalk on Broadway, and then they added the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| And then through the MPC process, 14 conditions were added to the Kroger's development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| which included more sidewalks along Knox, a cat transit bed, bicycle racks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| tree protection measures, an MPC-approved lighting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| and, of course, that is all in addition to meeting all applicable requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| of the city's engineering department, TDOT, TDEC, and the city's ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| and I thought a sidewalk ordinance was a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Now, if you would permit me to, I would like to change hats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and the remainder of my comments do not represent Fountain City connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| I am an economist by training, and I think that we need to talk about the economic impact of the business venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| We have an opportunity to have a $16 million project take place in our midst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| in economically challenging times, and challenging might be a generous term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| According to the Tennessee Business and Economic Outlook quarterly publication released last Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| by the Center for Business and Economic Research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| quote, the situation in Tennessee will get worse before it gets better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Quote, Tennessee will see job losses mount to 1.3 percent in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| while the unemployment rate will rise further to 8.1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| Quote, given the dismal economic news of the last several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| these figures may very well prove to be optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| I think we can all agree that 2009 is going to be a tough economic year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| This project will take close to a year to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| First, the demolition process, and then approximately eight months to construct the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| While not all of that $16 million will find its way into Knoxvillian's pockets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| many dollars will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Local contractors will be called upon to supply concrete and asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| and no doubt many subcontractors will be called on to help with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| People from outside our area who are hired to work on this project will sleep in our hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| and they will eat in our restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| And I think we all understand the notion of what economists call the multiplied effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| One dollar that's spent here is likely to go to a home here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| and that it's likely to be spent in another store here, and so on and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Even if you aren't convinced by the short-term economic gains through the construction process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| the new, almost twice as large store will need to increase its number of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| as has already been mentioned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| And finally, if you would allow me one more hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| As a Fountain City resident who is not represented by the Gibbs Drive Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| or, it seems, by Fountain City Town Hall in this situation, I want a new Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| I want a new Kroger. I'm sorry. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| I overheard a couple of ladies that were oohing and aahing over their first visit to the new Farragut Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| and all I could think was how terribly unfair this situation, this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| this decision is being driven by about two blocks of residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| but it's going to affect all of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| We're talking about a population of roughly 20,000 people who call Fountain City home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| and that doesn't include the 40,000-plus cars that drive by on Broadway every day through Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| people who depend on our commercial area for their shopping needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| And I ask you, please consider the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few and deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| You know, we're kind of, we're already a little over, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| There will be plenty of questions going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| so I think there will be plenty of chance for any answer to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| Those who spoke in favor now have two minutes to give a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| One person does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Actually, I was marking time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| I think they're probably out of abundance of caution for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| They'll probably do four minutes assuming there's going to be a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| Whoever's going to give the rebuttal, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| My name is Mary Leidig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| I live with my husband, George Scott, at 3045 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| First, we really are humbled to be here tonight by City Council's thoughtful representation for all these important issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2503)|
| 0:41:53| Your support of our neighborhood and of Fountain City as a whole is truly amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| It also happens to be the same day we are as a nation getting ready to elect a new president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| so it's just kind of momentous tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| As citizens of thriving neighborhoods that take pride in all of Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| we look forward to Kroger Supermarket opening a new store in the old lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| You've heard this over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| It's a sentiment we have expressed publicly and directly to Kroger for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| We continue also to support all of Kroger's proposals except one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| The compromises Kroger has made have been from their own requests for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| We believe this one issue is harmful to many Fountain City neighborhoods as well as Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| and will harm historic Gibbs Drive and turn it into literally a highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| We can't say enough about the walkability of our active street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| We are already pedestrian friendly, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| One full of bikes, children, baby carriages, joggers, and not just from our street but neighborhoods around us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2584)|
| 0:43:13| We're just seen as one of those streets to stroll on safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| We agree that public safety is primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| We agree with Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| The public safety concern from Kroger is based on a traffic study paid for by Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| and conducted during a time when Target was empty, the doors were closed, they'd relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| Thankfully, we do have some hard data from city records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| which show one minor traffic accident during a five-year period when Target's doors were open and busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2623)|
| 0:43:53| This fender bender accident, which happened during this busy season, was unrelated to Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2633)|
| 0:44:02| Target has thrived with the existing Broadway entrance for 20 years before moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| In fact, they outgrew the space, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| They're now in a bigger building themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| They were using the existing Knox entrance for those 20 years safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| When Kroger bought this property, as you know, zoning was in place to open on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| We support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Hence, we are here only because of the things that Kroger wishes to do differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| Finally, our current ordinance does not allow the entrance in front of the old Target property to be lined up with our street without a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2680)|
| 0:44:50| The intent of this section of the city ordinance says it is to promote the safety of present and future inhabitants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2690)|
| 0:45:01| We couldn't say that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| How progressive and mindful of the future for both businesses and neighborhoods in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2703)|
| 0:45:11| Fountain City doesn't have to lose an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| We remain ready and willing still to look forward to alternatives to this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2715)|
| 0:45:27| We do believe Kroger is asking us to accept 100 percent burden for something unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2727)|
| 0:45:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Mr. McNamara, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| I guess I'll let you get to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| By the way, with questions, it does help if people come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| You were not here four weeks ago when this was talked about, but I know Mr. Smith and Mr. Gianca were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| And this council talked about this issue for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| And this council made a decision that we weren't going to approve the appeal four weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| because we wanted to give Kroger an opportunity to rethink this and decide if they wanted to move the driveway or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2772)|
| 0:46:20| I just want to be clear, you're Becker saying you're not willing to move the driveway, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Can you help us understand why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| The point was brought up, there really haven't been accidents in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Help us understand why you would be more concerned about that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| Well, we're going to generate, I think Chris referred to it already, a grocery store drives a lot more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| I'm sure most of you, like myself, make it to the grocery store two or three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| So our customer counts are a lot higher than Target would have ever realized at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| Kroger is not willing to invest money and design a store where you're creating a situation where you have an unsafe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2818)|
| 0:47:09| I mean, we have plenty of places to invest our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Here in the Knoxville area, we're not going to go ahead and move forward with a development that creates an unsafe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| And again, with all due respect to the residents on Gibbs Drive, there is no factual information to support more people are going to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2839)|
| 0:47:27| through Gibbs Drive after the Kroger is there with a lined-up, safe access point than they do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| There is no factual information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Our traffic expert tells us that there's no way that there is more people going to drive down Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| The city engineer and staff think the access should be lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| I mean, I do this for a living, and access points need to be lined up to promote safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Mr. Bianca, could you put up the traffic diagram again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Mr. Kirby, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Kirby, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| Looking at this design of this traffic flow, I guess I agree with Kroger that with the two streets not aligned with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2890)|
| 0:48:25| it creates an unsafe situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| But I disagree with Kroger that aligning the streets is not going to create cut-through traffic down Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| And the reason for that is I think, as you just said, Mr. McNamara, a grocery store drives a lot more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| And I believe in time, if the entrance is aligned with Gibbs Drive, there's going to be a need for a traffic light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2924)|
| 0:48:53| And because Broadway is a state highway, a state route, if TDOT does the traffic studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| and determines a traffic light is needed, there's going to be a traffic light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| And that's when I think the cut-through traffic situation is going to occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| because it's going to be so much easier for people to come in and out of Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| My question is for Mr. King, our director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| Looking at making the most safe ingress and egress situation that we can have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| and also looking at protecting our neighborhoods from cut-through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| which Councilman Bailey and I worked, and Councilman Becker and Councilman Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| over a year on traffic calming in neighborhoods, trying to avoid the kind of cut-through situations that this might create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| Is there ever a situation in traffic engineering where you put an island of some sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| right where that word conflict is on the screen, so that you have the misaligned drives as they are now in that top picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2989)|
| 0:49:59| but there's a traffic island preventing a left turn out of Kroger going north on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| and preventing a left turn going south from Gibbs Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| And I realize that's an inconvenience to folks on Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| and I realize that it forces traffic coming out of the Kroger to turn south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| But there's also, I believe, egress and ingress to this property over on another portion of the property, is there not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| over on the Knox Road side or on the south side that would give traffic other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| Is that ever considered a means to prevent left turns from conflicting streets like this, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| Yes, that is one option that could be considered and actually was considered in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| And can you tell me why that option was rejected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Because I didn't realize that had been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Well, there are several options that one could construct that would prevent potential cut-through traffic down Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3052)|
| 0:51:02| The problem with almost all of them, unless I'm forgetting one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| requires either the Kroger development or the Gibbs Drive community to give up some degree of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| Just the one you described would mean that the Gibbs Drive community could not come out of their street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| turn left and go toward town in the same way a Kroger customer could not come out of the Kroger driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3082)|
| 0:51:30| turn left and go north toward Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Almost any option you could come up with requires one or both sides of the street to give up some degree of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3093)|
| 0:51:42| And were any of the players consolidated as to whether or not giving up that access was an acceptable compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3102)|
| 0:51:50| or was it just rejected out of hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| I wasn't involved in the meetings with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Let me jump in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| I think both sides have said, I don't want to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| but both sides have said that turning left out of their drive is very important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| And somebody say if I'm not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Well, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Say again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Could somebody maybe from Gibbs Drive come up and answer that question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| And, Mr. Mayor, I'm going to add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| And let me just say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| This is obviously one of those really hard ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Everybody wants this to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| We understand the desires of both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| So the questions here are just people trying to figure out a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| So, Paul, you want to speak to that or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| Either the first or second time we met with Mr. Zianca,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| it was proposed that Kroger change, have a bicycle seat median, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3163)|
| 0:53:04| that would prevent their customers from turning left onto Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| So it would be a right in coming from the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| I guess the question was, how does the Gibbs Drive neighborhood feel about not being able to turn left on Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| That's the question for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| Well, what we proposed was that this would be on the Kroger side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Right, but I'm asking, how do you all feel about it on your side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| If there was an island that prevented anybody from cutting straight across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| but it also prevented people from Gibbs Drive of turning left on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| Our issue with this, on the Kroger side and ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| is that any concrete median that is placed in now can be displaced later when someone asks for a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3226)|
| 0:53:58| and a different council takes up the issue and anything that's put in there can be taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3238)|
| 0:54:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| We are number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Go ahead, Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| My question was not to align Gibbs Drive and the exit of the Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| but to leave them as they are in the top picture where they are offset with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| but to address the safety problem that Kroger has pointed out with the offset entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| to put a cement barrier so that no traffic can turn left from either street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Now, that's an inconvenience to Kroger shoppers who want to use that exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| although I believe there are other egress points on the Kroger property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| but it's also an inconvenience to the Gibbs Drive residents who would no longer be able to turn south on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| And my question is, how does Gibbs Drive feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Was that rejected out of hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| I don't think that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| Our number one concern is not the alignment of Gibbs and Kroger's exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| Oh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| So that would work for Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| It may not work for Kroger, but it would work for Gibbs Drive to have the streets be misaligned or not aligned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| but it would address the safety issue that I'm hearing as a council member of the misaligned streets that would exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3321)|
| 0:55:29| because the cement barrier would prevent the traffic conflict of turning left on top of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Once again, we are not against Kroger's whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| We want you to come to Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| We simply don't want the 6,700 cars that you envision daily cutting up and down our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3341)|
| 0:55:50| And if leaving that exit and entrance where it is prevents that, then we are all in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| And that's all we've been asking for four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| I have a follow-up question for Mr. McNamara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| So how does Kroger feel about that kind of impediment at that particular point on Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| We've always taken the position, again, we're not opposed with the folks that live on Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| You know, whatever they want to feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| My personal opinion is there's not going to be any more cars cutting through there when it lines up and there's no modifications to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| But if that makes them feel comfortable to do something on their side of the road that limits the movement in and out of their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| you know, we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I want to make sure you understand my question, Mr. McNamara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| I'm asking if the drives are left as in the top picture where they are not aligned, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| But the safety issue, which is what you brought up as being your number one concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| was that if the drives are not aligned, there is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| If the safety issue is addressed with the kind of cement median that Mr. King mentioned that prevents a left turn from either street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3413)|
| 0:57:02| in other words, your Kroger shoppers cannot turn north on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| and the Gibbs Drive residents cannot turn south on Broadway, then you don't have that traffic conflict that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| Is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| No, because we need to have our customers be able to have full movement at that access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| You know, that's a main access point for us, and our customers are going to be coming from the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| and our customers are going to be coming from the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Our customers that choose to use that access point need to be able to make a left turn movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Can the safety be addressed with the drives not aligned but with the traffic light at your exit point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3454)|
| 0:57:45| Does that prevent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| And maybe this is a question for the traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| If you have a traffic light there but not at Gibbs Drive, the drives are not aligned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| but you have a traffic light at the Kroger exit, does that address the safety issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| The other problem it does add to us is the pure layout of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3477)|
| 0:58:05| We've got a very tight piece of property to lay out our development on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| and, of course, we have a certain prototypical store that we want to offer here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| and our store footprint lays out perfectly with having the drives aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| I understand that, but I'm trying to look for a compromise here, and the issue that you mentioned was safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| So I'm trying to address the safety issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| and I guess my follow-up question is for the traffic engineer about a traffic light there at the Kroger exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| Well, I like where you're heading with this, and I think you're doing a really good job in probing for a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| One of the things I'll just make mention is if there is a curving at the entrance of Gibbs Drive that restricts the movement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3519)|
| 0:58:49| I guess, to right in, right out, why does it matter if we're lined up or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| I think Mr. Jada addressed that a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| They're concerned that that could be removed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Could I speak with Mr. Kirby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| I can't remember your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Mr. Kirby, if Kroger has a traffic light, if the streets remain not aligned with one another, offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3548)|
| 0:59:15| and Kroger has a traffic light at their exit, does that solve the safety problem that we heard from you about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| Councilman Roddy, I believe that if you were to signalize the Kroger entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| you would also have to tie in Gibbs Drive with that signal for it to be safe or to function properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Mr. Becker, I think you're off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| No, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| I thought Ms. Roddy, for a minute there, had been hiding in my bedroom when I was awake the other night wrestling with this idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and what might work for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| But I think our ideas are just slightly different and probably will land with the same thud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| I think we need to toss out any possibility to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| You know, it's really hard to have three winners in the same ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| But I think we're in a ballgame where most of us would really like to see three winners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| and that would be the Gibbs Drive neighborhood, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| The community of Fountain City as a whole and the other area that could benefit from this kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| And I think everybody has spoken to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| And then the third winner would be Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| And so I would love to see if there is a way that we can find a way to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| This is somewhat similar to what Ms. Roddy recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| And I haven't talked to Mr. King about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| Steve, listen up and tell me how I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| But there's one question I absolutely have to have you, Mr. McNamara, and Mr. Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3651)|
| 1:01:01| If you'll stand up there, too, because I want you both to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| It's key to the whole possibility of a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| Traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| I've heard both of you tonight say there is no traffic light proposed for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3674)|
| 1:01:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| I want you to say that because we've got a little tricky thing over here that will record what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| There is no traffic light planned for this access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| And is that also what you said, Mr. Kirby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| In fact, we have it in writing in our traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| None of the warrants are met that would allow a traffic light to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| And moreover, I would like everyone to understand that typically the state looks at what we call an eight-hour warrant for traffic signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| And during the report, during the final stages of build-out, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| when we have the Kroger Inn and all the traffic assigned, that warrant is not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| Likely, if anybody goes out and counts, that signal warrant will never be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| I've had little experience with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| All right, now, given that statement, and thank you very much for making that a public statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| Given that, I think one of the greatest fears that this neighborhood has is that at some point in time we've all gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| We're going to go away at some point here before too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| In fact, in a year, five of us will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| So you can see how, you know, uncomfortable this makes people feel about decisions we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| because we won't always be here to uphold those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| Now, let's go back to is there a possible compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| I went back to Gibbs Drive again this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| And we took a nice long drive and went all the way down to Jacksboro, back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| and then we went over to the Target property, drove around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| I really hate to see that big box spot sit there undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| I don't think that is a help to the Gibbs Drive neighborhood in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| I see Kroger developing that property as a big plus for Fountain City, Gibbs Drive, for the city of Knoxville, for Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3803)|
| 1:03:37| In looking at that, when I leave Broadway and turn on to Gibbs Drive, you know, it's just another street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3817)|
| 1:03:45| It's just another street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| It doesn't say one thing to me, you know, special about how special it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| And we've tried to help you understand in Atlanta how special we think Gibbs Drive is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| It is. It's a very historic street, a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| You heard that a lot of families have lived their lives there and have their families all live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| What's a way that we can make Gibbs Drive even more special?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| With your agreement, there's going to be no traffic light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| If we came in, and I'll look, there's quite a bit of access, Mr. King, on both the south side and the north side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| as you enter Gibbs Drive from Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| There's a vacant lot on one side and a lot of right of way on the other side where the big house is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| that I've looked at since I was a little girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| So I'm thinking, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could widen, Mayor Haslam, that entrance to Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3880)|
| 1:04:49| and use some of that right of way, make it a lovely apron there, and in the center of Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| widen that entrance to it, and in the center put a beautiful median which is planted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| which has a wonderful sign that some of us will sell cookies and not be able to afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| and a beautiful sign that denotes historic Gibbs Drive and neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| And I believe with the absence of a red light and with the possibility of us finding a way to make a lovely entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3915)|
| 1:05:27| for Gibbs Drive that we could have three winners in this ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| And I know it's more complicated than that, but that's what I envision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| And I don't know if there would be any takers for that idea at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| but I'm just pitching it out to see what any of you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| Would someone like to speak to Gibbs Drive on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| Are you asking for someone from the neighborhood to speak, Ms. Filo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Well, yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| And, you know, I'm sorry that I have to pitch the idea out here because this is not a good place to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| On the other hand, I don't represent that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| And I don't represent that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| I didn't feel comfortable calling a meeting and telling you all what I dreamed up in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| This is a little bit to what you're talking about and a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| if I may step backward to the traffic light issue a moment since you asked that question directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| And correct me if I'm wrong because, believe me, I don't know what I'm doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| but a traffic light is never proposed until it is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3988)|
| 1:06:37| And maybe I didn't say that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| but why propose a traffic light when there's not traffic there to support a traffic light now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| If the Kroger store moves in and the traffic becomes heavier, which it will by their own admission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| the traffic will be much heavier than the Target store ever generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| And you're still asking my community, my street, to accept 100% of the burden of a possible future traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4019)|
| 1:07:12| And I do understand that the traffic light is not asked for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| It is not proposed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| But, again, what happens when that traffic increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| That's when someone will propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| I'm afraid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| I understand that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I also, in my little dream, thought maybe you would, Mr. McNamara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4048)|
| 1:07:37| make a signed statement saying that you will not propose a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Is that not a state issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| And I'm not trying to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| Steve, could you clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| This would actually help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| For a traffic light to happen, what has to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| Well, on a state route such as Broadway, what would have to happen is a competent engineering firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| like Wilbur Smith would do a warrant study that they've already done in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| If the signal was warranted, they would submit that to the city engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| We would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| The city administration would review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| and decide whether or not they would want to take that to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| There's a permit that there was one on council's agenda last week on Middlebrook Park, if you recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| That agreement has to be approved by city council before a signal can be installed on a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4108)|
| 1:08:35| The state does not install or maintain signals on state routes unless they are replacing one with a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4115)|
| 1:08:44| or unless they're rebuilding the street and one is warranted at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4124)|
| 1:08:52| Most of the time, traffic signals are installed by local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| It doesn't matter whether it's in the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| So the state has to assert that it's warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| The administration and council basically have to vote the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| And, Steve, I think you and I both went through the process of the difficulty of trying to get one warranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4146)|
| 1:09:15| where it was desperately needed on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| It took quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Like Mr. Kirby said, the state does not use all the warrants in the manual on uniform track control devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4160)|
| 1:09:28| They only use particularly one warrant, and that is the eight-hour warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| And that is the one that's the most difficult to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| And my understanding is, based on the traffic report for the Kroger development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| that even with the projections for the use of the store in their traffic projection, it does not meet the warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| I don't know if Mr. Becker or Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| I have a question for Mr. Dickinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| I don't have any questions for the folks at Kroger's if they want to get comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| But I was comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| We heard a little while ago, you know, talk about the city engineering department work to try to come up with proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4207)|
| 1:10:14| and both sides on this issue were consulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Was Gibbs Drive ever talked to about what city engineering was working on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| Prior to the end of August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| Anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Anytime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| You know, you've heard a common theme here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| Kroger's is welcome in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| Kroger's bought the property, lock, stock, and barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Lock, stock, and barrel also included the zoning in place to open on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4248)|
| 1:10:57| Kroger's, in looking at some of their variances, they're listing as one of their reasons for needing a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| a pre-developed, buying a pre-developed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| If council will recall, the reasons for granting variances, buying a pre-developed site isn't one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4270)|
| 1:11:20| Kroger's has tried to obtain multiple variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| and they've been supported by the community on all but one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| You know, this gets back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| This is a fairly regular discussion of the balance of needs versus communities versus neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4291)|
| 1:11:42| This will be the third location of Kroger's within Fountain City alone in about 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| Gibbs Drive and the streets surrounding that have been there for around 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| It does not make sense to me personally to run the risk of destabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4316)|
| 1:12:05| and economic harm to their surrounding neighborhoods as well as the city for a business, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| welcome, one which moves around every 10 to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| You heard a little bit earlier about what I'm about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| We have a department called Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| What does Community Development do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| They work to revitalize business areas and neighborhoods that have fallen on hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| Vestal, North Central, just to name two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| And, in part, those business areas and those neighborhoods fall on hard times because of poor planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4359)|
| 1:12:49| wrong decisions, errors in judgment that may not manifest for 10, 15, 20 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4369)|
| 1:12:59| So, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Every year, year in and year out, we fund Community Development hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4381)|
| 1:13:10| to revitalize business areas and revitalize neighborhoods to correct wrongs that have been made in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| I wish we didn't have to have so many cotton-picking plans that we have to revitalize areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4400)|
| 1:13:31| Kroger's traffic study was done by Kroger's hired expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| I take exception to the notion that a neighborhood group is expected to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| and hire a traffic engineer when they're the ones who live on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| and they went out and got the hard data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| The Wilbur Smith study was done with a closed facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| The hard data shows, in about the past five years, there's been one accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| In my opinion, Kroger's is setting up the need for a traffic light in the future, whether they say it tonight or never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4448)|
| 1:14:20| My concern is there will be a large amount of not just consumer traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| but commercial traffic starting to come through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| And when Kroger's is asking for variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| some of the variances they're asking for are also from safety standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| I've seen the petition on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| I would have signed both of the petitions because I like Kroger's too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| I took a look at the petition that was passed around in a Fountain City restaurant over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4490)|
| 1:14:59| I think there are some flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| I also looked at some of the names that I could decipher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Now, one interesting thing was that most of the folks who signed the petition didn't have an address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| but I was able to find some of those addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| And we have, sure, there are folks from Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| There are folks from Halls, from Rita, from Dante, from South Knoxville, from East Knoxville, and from West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| It's reflective of the crowd that you would see at a popular Fountain City restaurant over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| Does that reflect the views of the people who are going to have to live with the decision of this city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4533)|
| 1:15:44| I think that petition really reflects, for the most part, and reasonable minds can certainly disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| but the views of those who don't really have to worry about what could happen to their own neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| because it's not their own homes on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| There might be a motion made later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| I know other lights are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| But, you know, Kroger's from both Mr. Woodhull and Mrs. Pelow, last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4566)|
| 1:16:14| clearly, politely suggested to come back with a different plan from Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| So, I honestly was hoping for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| I'm honestly, I'm disappointed that that didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| I think that, you know, this is something that can be remedied with a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| I understand that the folks from Earth Fair, who are opening at the closed bilo on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4598)|
| 1:16:47| are aware of this controversy tonight and have already driven through this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| Not going inside, driving around the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| If it's not Kroger's, it might be someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| Many times this council has turned down proposed developments because we have been able to do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| because what was proposed wasn't the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| I'll remind this council back on Buffett Mill area a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| We turned down a proposal that it was an okay proposal, but council, in their wisdom, thought we could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4634)|
| 1:17:22| And what did we get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| About a year and a half later, we got a better proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| I think we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| I guess I largely want to agree with Councilman Frost and just stress two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| One, I think a lot of things have worked out for the better over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| and I think this is a valuable piece of property and will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| But most importantly, four weeks ago we talked about this for about as long as we've talked about it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| And we actually made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| It was my recommendation not to approve the appeal that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| specifically to give Kroger a chance to decide if they wanted to redesign their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| And I'm like Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| I'm a little surprised, a little hurt, a little disappointed that Kroger isn't coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| and saying because that's what we asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| So I feel like we made a decision on this four weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| And I haven't seen any new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| I appreciate Ms. Roddy and Ms. Pelow trying to think of compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| I've been through two long meetings with the neighborhoods talking about a lot of compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| And if anything flies, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| but we have people that are fundamentally disagreeing with each other on alignment here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| and I don't see a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| Let me make one quick clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Kroger's, I mean, in terms of they've worked hard with our engineering department and us to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| we kept saying obviously there's a problem here that council did not feel favorable about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| So we talked about a multitude of different possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Can you turn your building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| What happens if you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| What happens if you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| So I do want to be real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| They have listened to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| as we made all of our amateur suggestions about how you could realign things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| So it's not like they just said, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| As far as I know, before the meeting four weeks ago, Kroger's, I think, I think did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Mr. Kleiniger presented something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| It was on a, wasn't on a napkin, but it was close to that, of an idea for how to do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| And they took it and took it seriously and had the engineers review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| They've done a good job with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Truth is, there isn't anything different than what we had four weeks ago right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| I don't think it's for lack of effort would be my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| It's definitely not lack of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| I think I'm saying that partly because I don't know that continued effort to find a compromise gets us anyplace new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Mr. King, I'm going back to my question about the design of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| If the roads remain offset and Gibbs Drive is willing to give up their ability to turn south on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4780)|
| 1:19:50| but Kroger feels that their customers need to be able to turn both north or south on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| is there room there to have a barrier such that folks exiting, there'd be a sign at Gibbs Drive that says no left turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4797)|
| 1:20:06| and there's some kind of barrier in the median where folks from Gibbs Drive cannot turn south on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| but that barrier is not so long as to prevent folks who are exiting the Kroger from turning north on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| So it solves the safety problem, which Kroger has said is their number one barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| and it also allows the customers of Kroger to turn both north or south out of their parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| which Mr. McNamara said was a must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| But the barrier at Gibbs Drive solves the safety issue, which Kroger has waved a red flag as being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4837)|
| 1:20:47| I think that could work, except the barrier would only be a curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| Explain to me what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Well, because you're dealing with the width of the center turn lane, which is probably 11 or 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| So in order to allow the left turn out of the Kroger driveway going north, you have to have that lane width there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4861)|
| 1:21:10| So your separation would be a curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| You don't have room to build an island to prevent the left turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| I know there's not a lot of room because the separation of the offset is not very great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| So how do you prevent folks from Gibbs Drive from turning south to eliminate the traffic conflict problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4883)|
| 1:21:31| Well, one way to prevent, and I think this has already been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| but someone mentioned an island at Gibbs that they referred to as the right in, right out island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| That would channelize the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| If you're northbound on Broadway, you could turn right into Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| And if you're coming out of Gibbs, you would only be able to turn right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| Well, this is kind of like Mrs. Pila's suggestion of putting like a triangle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| I mean, hers was beautiful, but just like a triangle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| The people exiting Gibbs Drive can only go right in, right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| But then the offset place at Kroger, their customers can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| My question is that, I mean, what I have heard Kroger say loud and clear is safety is the number one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| Now, I heard Mr. McNamara say secondly that he had some design issues with the layout and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| But if everybody's going to give up something here to make it happen, tell me why that can't be a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| Mr. McNamara, can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Just so I'm clear, you're proposing that there be, say it one more time just so it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| What I'm proposing is that you maintain the offset alignment of the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| that Gibbs Drive has said tonight that they are willing to accept a limitation in terms of the egress and entrance to their street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4965)|
| 1:22:54| And Gibbs Drive, if you are northbound on Broadway, becomes right in, right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| So if I'm coming from 640 up Broadway, I can turn right into Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| And if I'm coming out of Gibbs Drive to exit, I can only go north on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| And that's achieved by, say, a triangle-shaped island is what I'm envisioning at the entrance to Gibbs Drive such that traffic is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4990)|
| 1:23:18| as Mr. King said, channelized and you can't go, people coming out of Gibbs Drive can't turn south on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| So that solves the safety issue in terms of the conflict of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| Kroger, it also addresses Kroger's concern that their customers need to be able to turn north or south when they're leaving the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| Well done on your discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| The only issue that would remain from our standpoint would be our layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| Again, given the prototypical store that we're building here, shifting the drive back to the south does interfere with a lot of the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5029)|
| 1:24:01| does interfere with a lot of the parking, does kind of quirk our drive there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| But you said that safety was the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| You said safety was why you couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| And this solves the safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| And it also allows your customers to leave your store going either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| I mean, is this worth taking this off the table for another two weeks to go back and talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5056)|
| 1:24:26| Because, I mean, we also, I think engineering is going to have to do some measuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| As Mrs. Pilo said, there may not be sufficient room at the current exit of Gibbs Drive to create this kind of channelized traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| We'd have to go back and do some measurement as a city to see if we have the easement to create that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| And maybe Mrs. Pilo needs to jump in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| I'm a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| I didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| What I understand Gibbs Drive saying is, because we had talked about it once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| about what if we put a little island that blocked the people going straight across out of Target or out of Kroger into Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5092)|
| 1:25:01| where unfortunately it would force the neighborhood to turn right only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| And I thought that was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| What I'm hearing you say is we're willing to live with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| but we're not willing to live with the chance that some future council comes and scrapes our island out and puts a light in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| That's what I heard you all say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| And I'm sorry, I'm a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| I think what Mrs. Pilo was proposing was this, is if there's enough room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| what if the city put a the island was something that blocked traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| and also had the defined entrance with trees and a permanent side to where nobody's going to come scrape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| It's like the entrance to Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Nobody's going to come scrape that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| I don't know if all that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| And I'm sorry, Barbara, I didn't pick that up when you were saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| But I understand your all's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| Eventually somebody could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Now, I don't think that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| I don't think a council is ever going to put in a light that you don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| I don't think the politics will work because you have to have the state, the administration, the council vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| But if something could be designed like that where there's a permanent entrance to Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| like a Cherokee Boulevard entrance that like who in the world would ever scrape that away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| is that something that we should take time to study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| And I'm not trying to put everybody on the spot now, but, I mean, I'm seeing some nodded heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5162)|
| 1:26:10| Paul, Connie, I mean, I hate to make you speak for the whole group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| but is that something that you want us to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| I hate to speak for the whole group, but I will say, and this may be naive on my part, my business is designed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| Granted, it is on a much smaller scale than an engineered parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| My business is compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| And I've worked around a lot of different compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Our neighborhood is willing to compromise on anything except aligning those entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5197)|
| 1:26:45| If we can work out a design, we are willing to sit down and discuss anything that does not involve alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5205)|
| 1:26:55| Alignment gives way to future changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| And might I also point out that, and I appreciate your concern of your customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5219)|
| 1:27:08| sorry to say clients, your customers having access to Broadway, but they will at a traffic light at Knox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5228)|
| 1:27:19| So, and correct me, you sort of alluded to the fact that there are three stores there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| I don't know if you're planning on consolidating into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| And if that's the case, then I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| But the Knox Road light does exist and offers easy entrance and exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| just like the current target has that's down at Highland, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| And it works well down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| But the Kroger, I'm sorry, Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| But we are willing to entertain anything other than alignment, anything other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| I'm going to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| I'm going to go to Mr. Becker, and then I'll come to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| You know, one thing I love about this body is how smart it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| I mean, I don't want to track the record, but it had to be not more than ten minutes ago I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| there's no point in looking for a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| There ain't one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| We are so smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| This feels good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Now, Mr. McNamara, I still haven't heard you say, yes, this is worth pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| And I'm looking for that, because this sounds like a good idea from up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| We've obviously put a lot of time, effort, and money into this, and we want to reach a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| We've obviously had experts study this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| We've given a lot of time and thought to this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| We're willing to delay a decision for two weeks to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| I'm not saying that it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Obviously, our layout right now shows it lined up, and I don't know why it still can't be lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| I think the mayor spoke to that it's a long shot that there would ever be a signal at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| I do want to address a couple of the comments that Mr. Frost made as it relates to our story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| Is this more rebuttal time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| No, but I mean we typically go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| I just want to make sure the facts are straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| We have three stores on Broadway, and it is not our intention to close any store other than the one that's two-tenths of a mile south of this target property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5356)|
| 1:29:28| The three stores that we have on the street, both the store in Fountain City and the one south of there have been open for 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5368)|
| 1:29:38| So your comment about Kroger relocates every 12 years is not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| The store up in halls north of this location has been open 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| So I just want to make sure that that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| And if somebody, if a company, whether it's Kroger or somebody else, is relocating in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| and producing and investing and putting in a better facility, I don't see why that's a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Yeah, just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| I guess, Mr. McNamara, we sat here four weeks ago and said we want Kroger to not line up the drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| And you came back and said, oh, we want to line up the drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| If we postpone tonight to give you a chance to think about this, I don't want to see somebody from Kroger at that podium saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| here's why we want to line up the drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| So if you all decide you can't work with this solution, just don't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| And I just want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Mr. Frost, you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| I haven't said anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| A couple of things, and I appreciate Councilman Becker's passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| Four weeks ago when council, you know, said, hey, guys, go take a look here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| I want to make it clear that what a couple of folks have said, we said go back and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| What I was saying that day was go back and everybody try to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| I wasn't committing one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| And just as what Councilman Becker just said, I hope you go back and look at this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| But when he says it's we, I'm not really in that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| I want to make that clear that I'm not saying go back and come back with this answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| I'm saying go back, if you're going to take a look at it, and look at this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| And I would advise you to go look at it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| But I don't want to be interpreted that either my silence here or my saying go back and take a look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5480)|
| 1:31:27| that is indicative of how I'm going to vote two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| But I am saying I would advise you to go back and take a look at it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| because good faith effort is going to be very important to me on both sides in determining what I'm going to vote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5496)|
| 1:31:45| I've heard and I understand what Gibbs Drive is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| You know, I heard Ms. Buchanan earlier make some very valid points about the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| But I also hear some very good suggestions here from council members about some resolutions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| that actually deal with your safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| And I'll be very interested to see how you guys respond and to see if I think it is a good faith effort in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| First, you know, I was talking to Mr. Cloninger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| He called me over the weekend about the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| And he talked about how he had been living on Gibbs for 30-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| He talked about how the first location was south of the present location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| which is now where Party City and Blockbuster is, and then the current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| So, in fact, this would be the third location in 30 years in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5554)|
| 1:32:40| Second, when we're talking about potentially tearing up the entrance of Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5560)|
| 1:32:49| which would require acquiring property, putting together flower beds or whatever, which sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5569)|
| 1:33:03| But, you know, one thing we go through regularly is are we adding reoccurring costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| I mean, just this week the mayor sent us an e-mail about the parking in front yards ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5589)|
| 1:33:17| It doesn't have anything to do with this issue, except that there was the concern of the cost of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5597)|
| 1:33:25| There is a cost of if we do something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| So, you know, that's something to take into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| If we're going to, you know, talk about the concern about costs of one thing, you also, you know, need to remember that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5614)|
| 1:33:45| Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| I just want to thank my fellow council members who are actively pursuing some type of a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| And it looks like there are some real opportunities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| And this is a $16 million opportunity, 100 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| And I just think there's a way to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| And I appreciate Kroger's willingness to go back and take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| and try to find some solution because I think we're really, really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| And this councilman would just like to see it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| I just wanted to kind of follow up on Councilman Frost's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| because I, too, would like to thank Kroger for considering another location here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| I just went down to do a little welcoming thing at Farragut for the new Sentinel last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| and was in your store there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| It's the biggest store I've ever been in my life and I didn't have all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| so I just was in a very tiny little corner of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| But it's lovely and they are quite pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| and there's been quite a bit of infrastructure there to allow you to do what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| And, of course, I'm concerned about the cost, absolutely concerned about the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| But, you know, a long time ago my daddy said to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| you have to spend a little money sometimes to make a little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| So I think, you know, we have to look at the fact that this is a huge investment on the part of a company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| which sees real possibilities in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| And I think Gibbs Drive is definitely worth a bit of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| because I think it's one of the treasures in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| and it's one of the neighborhoods that doesn't have any recognizable entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| and place to maybe speak to its history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| So I just know that we're going to have three winners here when we come back in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| but I think we have to take this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Two weeks is a short time and if folks need to talk to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| I think it's really important that that happen outside of this very public place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| because I think sometimes you get a lot more accomplished when you're just sitting one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| So I really encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| Thank you so much for spending the time with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| and allowing us to tell you we would like for you to continue to be a big part of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| but sometimes there are just little tiny things that need to get worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Mr. McNamara, since I seem to get an indication from you that you are willing to consider a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| that would involve offset drives but with some modifications to Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| that would address the traffic safety concern that you brought to us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| I'd like to propose a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| There's a motion on the floor to postpone for two weeks and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Is there discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| I guess a housekeeping measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| Am I to assume that we also are hopeful that our engineering folk will be involved in this discussion, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5805)|
| 1:36:53| And it's your direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| We're willing to do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| I think that would be helpful, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| especially if ultimately the city is going to have to take some actions if this idea works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| that it would be important that over these two weeks as Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| and whatever representative from the neighborhood talks that hopefully our engineering people will be involved also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| and it would just be a request I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Obviously, that's at your discretion, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| I can tell you up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| We will do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Councilman Hook, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| I'll come to Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| I think I heard the folks from Gibbs Drive say that they're okay with a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| You don't have to get up at the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| You can nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| I was just going to say while this postponement occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| if there are meetings with the city engineering department that Gibbs Drive is invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| Well, no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Before, the reason we didn't before is we were just trying to see with Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| is there any way you guys can live with a different layout and proposing different things there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| But obviously, at this point, we will do our best to pull all that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| Any other points or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| All those in favor of postponing for two weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| 11A is a resolution requesting and encouraging the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| and the professional staff of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to study, evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| and analyze the feasibility and potential for adopting a comprehensive sidewalk ordinance for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5893)|
| 1:38:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Yeah, there's been a lot of discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| I know there's almost something from engineering, Mr. King, that will be here in two weeks on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| So I'd like to postpone this for two more weeks until the proposal from engineering comes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Amerisco, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| to conduct an investment-grade energy water audit of various city properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| and deliver a proposal recommending energy conservation measure projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| and a projected annual cash flow analysis for each conservation measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| and to outline the proposed terms for a future energy savings agreement that the city desires to implement in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| based on the results of the audit at no cost to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| as long as the city executes a subsequent energy savings agreement with Amerisco, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| following its audit and proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Yeah, were there any presentations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| Does the city have anything to say about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Madeline, do you want to or Boyce, do you all want to comment real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| We can if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Madeline and Boyce, maybe if you all would both come down just so we can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| While we wait for them to come down, if I can jump in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| I served on the RFP committee that looked at the proposals for this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| and I can assure you that we had a large number of highly qualified proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| and the vetting process was extremely thorough and complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| We had a number of meetings to look at those proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| and I know the negotiations with the preferred vendor, Amerisco, were lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| And I'm pleased with our final product that we have here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| because there's no obligation on the part of the city to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| I mean, this energy audit is a huge piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| and assuming that we bring some of the suggested improvements to Amerisco to do for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| then there's no charge to the city for the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| And the information that we're going to gain just from this audit is going to be a tremendous tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| I think, going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| So I'll let them speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Well, I asked a few questions to Madeline earlier today pertaining to how much the audit would cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| and it's a $200,000 price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| And if we continue to move forward, then they take that out of the profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| But here's what I wanted to ask is, have we negotiated a margin with Amerisco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6045)|
| 1:40:53| And is Amerisco here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Amerisco is not here right now for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| They asked if we wanted them to come, and we said we felt like we could field anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| As far as when you're getting into profit margins and stuff, no, none of that has been discussed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| Right now they're just talking about we're looking at the contract to do the audit itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| That will come later as we get into the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| Let me just say this, then, because I have a little experience in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| that there's a number of ways that they can mark up the margins and, you know, through the equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| the sales of the equipment, the improvements that they'll make, there will be a margin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| And then on top of that is the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| And what I wanted to get to is, in my opinion, there's really no need to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| it's not necessary to have these, you know, different margins add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| And I would just hope that we could look at some sort of a cap on the margin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| and that's the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| To tell you the truth, sir, what we've got, as they come back, it's part of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6119)|
| 1:42:06| the forms that they have to fill out, I don't want to call them forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| the proposal sheets that they come back with when they're recommending any energy conservation measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| They have got to show us, for that measure, not only what kind of savings is it going to generate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| but how much is it costing them, how much are they marking it up, so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| And for those, we either agree or we disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| or we tell them to back up and meet them somewhere in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| So it's full disclosure on that, and that is a part of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| that they have to have open, completely open disclosure on the pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6160)|
| 1:42:50| Anything else, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| No, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| My point is, is that a lot of these companies don't come back and charge you for the audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| And I know that comes out of the profits, but that's, to me, an unnecessary addition to what, how they make their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6180)|
| 1:43:09| And, you know, and, of course, it comes out of the savings, and I understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| They're going to make some profit or they wouldn't be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| But what I'm saying is we'll know what that is and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| But the good news about what we're doing right now is, like we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| unless we decided not to do any conservation measure, then we don't pay a dime as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6206)|
| 1:43:35| I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Councilman Reilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I wanted to respond a little bit to Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I know in the discussions and looking at these proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| one of the things we were acutely aware of is it's very difficult to accurately quantify what energy savings you're achieving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6222)|
| 1:43:51| And there are actually a number of different mathematical formulas, algorithms, that are used to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| And different companies utilize different algorithms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| But one of the things that I think weighed heavily in this vendor's favor is that they don't have a proprietary manufacturing arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6239)|
| 1:44:06| So a number of the proposals that we looked at are operating on both sides of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| And they may do a very fine job of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| but we felt like we would get more objective information from a company that didn't have a reason to try to drive us toward their systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6254)|
| 1:44:24| their controls, their manufacturing arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| This is all this company does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| So hopefully that will work in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| Councilman, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Well, I talked to Madeline Weil earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| and I'm concerned that we don't get ourselves into a position where we don't really see the value of what we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| And I think an audit stands to put us in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| But I think the way this thing's structured, we're not at all that great a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| I mean, we could, at worst case, pick up the cost of the audit and get nothing else out of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| That's unlikely to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| You know, again, it gets rolled back into the profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| If they don't show us an acceptable, my understanding is an acceptable ROI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| then we're not obligated to cover the cost of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| That's what I understood from Madeline Weil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| So, you know, there's some protection in there, and it doesn't just leave us completely exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| And $200,000 is a lot of money, especially given where we're at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| and what we're looking at in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| But it seems like an acceptable risk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6340)|

| 1:49:40| we have a methodology where we're trying to coordinate with development in these overlay areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6580)|
| 1:49:49| where new construction has to tie to alleys rather than to the public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6589)|

| 1:52:55| I don't see Ferris Ede here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| Mr. Ede had approached me on behalf of the current owners of the property, the old Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| Silphin property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6784)|

| 1:53:10| Councilman Pilo and I had a discussion about which one it really was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| They essentially want to get it rezoned so they can sell it and anticipate the market being housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6796)|
| 1:53:26| Mr. Ede had supplied this information to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6806)|
| 1:53:34| He and I had talked about, originally they talked about R3 and he had assured me that they had amended their request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6814)|
| 1:53:40| rezoning from R3 to a planned residential, I think it's RP3 but I can't remember anyway, a planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6820)|
| 1:53:52| And I'm more comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| We talked about going to the form-based code that is being developed now for Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| There's still a bit of a time issue there perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| We arrived at this probably being the best way of approaching it because the same kinds of conditions more or less could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| placed on the planned district, you know, and the use and review requirements that would exist with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6851)|
| 1:54:21| One concern I have with going to the RP zone, again, I'm the one that would like to see it go RP to give a higher level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6861)|
| 1:54:29| control of the planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| One of the concerns I have is that it doesn't allow a mix of uses, whereas R3 actually does allow some commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6871)|
| 1:54:40| And I think that's one of the things we might want to take a look at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| I doubt if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| It depends on how quickly this property sells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| I don't think whoever buys it will be the ones that will come back with a plan and under use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| So I think this is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| I would like, since Mr. Eade supplied this information directly at my request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| and that's the way Mr. Swanson had written this, but I would like to, I don't know if it requires an amendment or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6902)|
| 1:55:11| Mr. Donaldson, to ask you all specifically to look at planned residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| I think we would view those as the appropriate residential district in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Well, I think we're getting that on record then for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| I'd like to go on record as saying I think that is the thing that we should be looking at here is a planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6929)|
| 1:55:36| And if it comes back to this council in any other way, I think we ought to be very careful about what we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6936)|
| 1:55:44| And if it's considered, if it's on record and it's considered by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| even if that's not what they come back with, this council could take that action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| and approve it as a planned residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6952)|
| 1:55:56| But, again, this is, right now, this is the one-year plan amendment rather than the rezoning that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6956)|
| 1:56:03| So that's, all this is on record, but it only applies to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=6970)|

| 1:57:18| Yeah, it's Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| I have to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| In general, I want to make a comment sort of about all these annexations where we're cleaning up property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| where we've done minor annexations before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7045)|

| 1:57:36| I just want to urge the administration to move forward to bring these properties in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| I think it's not fair when people live on city streets and drive on city streets and don't pay city taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7060)|

| 1:57:55| We know that Councilman Becker is going to bring it up when the rezoning comes before us anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| so do you know what the current zoning of this particular parcel is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| It's a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| It's a used car business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| It is already zoned commercial in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| I'm sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| There's been no request, though, for a certain zone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| We would bring it in at the comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081104?start=7095)|
