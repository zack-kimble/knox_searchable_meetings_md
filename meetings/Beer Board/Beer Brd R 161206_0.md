| 0:02:51| new items like chorizo, ceviche, and we're going to do buffet on Sundays, maybe Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| and Sundays. Something that we bring from our location in Farragut. So we're very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=178)|

| 0:03:13| we're only one inspection away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| Okay. Well, thank you. And I know that you'll see some of us there because we were frequenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| of the former place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=201)|

| 0:03:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| All right. Thank you. And we're glad that your mother does have fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Well, no. They never found her fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Okay. All right. But we know she's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=240)|

| 0:04:07| Coward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=247)|

| 0:04:09| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=250)|

| 0:04:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Any ideas when you're going to be pouring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| We're probably looking at about three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Okay. All right. Well, good luck in getting this all up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=264)|

| 0:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Next is Ovations Food Services at Chilhowee Park. This permit is for the Jacob Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=277)|

| 0:04:50| File complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=290)|

| 0:04:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| All right. Now, Ovations is the food operator for the Jacob Building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| Yes. Just the Jacob Building on top of the hill, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Right. And you will be able now to have beer for special events and things that go on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Correct. I don't see us doing that very often, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Okay. All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Okay. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Do you also run the auditorium coliseum concessions or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| Yes. We're the food and beverage provider at the Civic Coliseum and Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Do you have a separate beer permit for that or you don't serve beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| Yes. We do have a separate license for that, permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| All right. Thank you so much and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Okay. Just a comment, kind of clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| We have several locations for SMG that manages it, but each specific location has to have its own beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=342)|
| 0:05:50| Own permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| And that's why we have one for the Jacob Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| And all the inspections are site-specific, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Right. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| And we have one for the Homer Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| And the zoo is in Chilhowee Park and they also have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| And then, as he pointed out, this Coliseum Auditorium has its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| So every place has to have its own separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| It's not one permit covers all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Just a reminder that we have coming up a beer board workshop to look at sales to underage purchasers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=377)|
| 0:06:26| And I'm working with Kim Ponce from Top Shelf and Karen from MDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| And I think that we'll have some information to help guide us in what we need to do or not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| And when is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Top Shelf at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| In this location, we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Small room, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| And you will remind us, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Oh, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| And, Mr. Frost, I think you're going to have to send out an email tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| Actually, I sent it out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| When you all – right before I came down here, you all – I sent everyone an email asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| we're going to have a meeting next week with the chair, Alison Dyer, of the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| We're going to talk about the upcoming workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| So if you all have topics to put on the agenda that we need to consider beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| and maybe do some research, if you all could get those to me by Tuesday of next week, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| One of the things I'd like to know is what is the structure that other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| and neighboring counties do when they have people who sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| What's their fine structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| What's their suspension structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| We do have one permit holder in the city that is facing, in January, a 21-day suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| and a $2,500 fine, and that was their third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Twenty-one days is a long time, and it will impact their business, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| They also have a new manager at that location who is seasoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| and so I feel comfortable that we won't be seeing them again for a fourth violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| Is that Bravo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Can you use a firing squad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| Is that one way to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| No, that's one of the things that we're going to talk about in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| and if that's the will of this beer board, then we'll bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| When does their suspension start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| January 8th to the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| So they will be able to serve during the holidays, but then they won't be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| And they've already had a TABC suspension and fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| It's been very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Yeah, it was an expensive pouring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| Is it their third or second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Their third for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| So they did the TABC already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Why they didn't do them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Well, because we didn't get the paperwork in time to get them all done at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| As you know, we still have that lagging notification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| and we can't proceed until we get the paperwork from TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| Do you know when the TABC, when that suspension took place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| I think it has already occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| It has, but I don't remember when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| And I'm thinking it was back in August and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| TABC failed to act on their second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| They didn't act at all for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| So anyway, they've taken one hit, and now they'll be taking a second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| Well, just out of curiosity, I mean, do they negotiate the dates as to when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| I've been to one hearing the whole time that I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| I think they work with a hearing officer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| It's just convenient that they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| ...in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| This is their third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| They should have been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| And if there is a fourth offense, then obviously their permit would be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| And that would be pretty serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| All right, no other business before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Let's socialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd161206?start=600)|
