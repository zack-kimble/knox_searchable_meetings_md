| 0:02:15| all this work done for inspection we're shooting for somewhere between six and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| ten months six and ten months yes ma'am well when you apply for a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| it's our expectation that you will have your construction and things done within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| 90 days that's part of the ordinance that deals with this so you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| absolutely that it'll be six to ten months no ma'am it could possibly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| before that we're just giving worse overshooting overshooting yes ma'am yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=160)|
| 0:02:48| we'll need to postpone this or the other alternative is we could table it and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| they could call a month out and then we'll bring it back up well they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| go through a new check or task force or anything if it's been more than a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| mr. frost would you like to weigh in you say you need the motion to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| before you if you change a vote so move let's let's let's ask excuse me yeah we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| asked them what what they would because essentially if we approve this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| then you should have everything finished in 90 days right correct and if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| you're gonna have to come back and tell us why you haven't finished and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| that you're working on construction and then we can postpone it again or we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| could take back the approval and then when you think you're getting close you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| can call us and come back and we'll approve it and then you can get it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| done so what would you like us to do what have we done for mr. Weigel because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| we've approved his final documentation and then we vote to continue it I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| recently had a conversation with him about a different direction to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| that and we'll be talking about that as a beer board and I would defer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| chair if you think whatever you think makes sense it would be fine with me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| postpone it for 90 days and then by 90 days you should know how close you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| and whether you need another extension or not would that work mr. Wallace would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| that work with you well it works but I mean they're here and it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| approved and no we did vote on them so and the easiest thing to do we have we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| have given people a year and we give mr. Weigel a lot longer than that I mean to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| all of a sudden evoke that on them I just think that's I mean it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| inconsistent I mean we voted on it and okay he answered honestly all right so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| let's just yeah that's fine with me can they come back in 90 days and just tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| us their progress yeah absolutely yeah leave it approved but maybe by some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| stroke you'll be done in 90 days which is it would be a great thing for you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| I'm sure yes it does okay so in essence you have an approval now but you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=300)|
| 0:05:22| to both get the documentation from the inspections and I guess wait that period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| of time all right so you're approved pending final documentation in 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| we'll hear you'll hear from us again wanting to know where you are and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| you're doing okay all right thank you next is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| Clarion Hotel on Central Avenue Pike mr. Kendall's representing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| chairman members of the board I do appreciate the time as we were last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| we've encountered some additional problems at the Clarion Hotel in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| the city with the contractor that we had out there that was doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| renovations didn't obtain the appropriate permits from the city there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| was a stop order issued we've resolved that and they're back at work and it do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| inspect the renovations to be completed in a timely manner frankly within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| next 30 days or so however that did cause some delay in getting some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| documentation together both to the Knoxville Police Department as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| the city I put a call in to both earlier today just to let them know that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| likely be requesting another deferral for about 30 days I think at 30 days we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| may have the inspections the other inspections done will certainly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| everything to the Knoxville Police Department we may even have all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| inspections done but if not we may appear back before this board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| request that the application be approved pending just those inspections from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| building and the Health Department that sort of thing but I would respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| ask for just another 30-day deferral to bring this back up all right the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| Shashikant Patel, Manheer Patel, Ishwar Patel and Nancy Pickle have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| submitted the proper forms to the beer board they also have not completed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| background records check and the task class so we're not going to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| and approve this until the applications are in and the background checks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| done. And I understand that completely one of the problems in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| ones I've outlined is that a couple of these owners live out of state and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| had some time getting the documentation particularly for fingerprints from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| other law enforcement agencies that sort of thing so we're well aware of that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| I appreciate you calling that to my attention we fully intend to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=458)|

| 0:14:48| Knoxville Zoo Drive. Okay. Sergeant Coward. We're missing fingerprints and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| background check on manager Holder. Okay. Miss Dyer. We need a copy of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=896)|

| 0:15:15| Could you clarify what happened? The manager that had a problem is removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Mr. Bowen is no longer the manager. They have now brought in Mr. Holder and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| Holder faxed an application but we don't have an original application. He has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| taken the task class but Mr. Holder has not had his fingerprints and record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| check completed. So that's scheduled? He's doing that on Thursday yes. Yes or we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| have a new manager next month probably. Is that right? Anyway I've talked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| the zoo about this. I've talked with his people in Minnesota and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| understands that we will defer this to the next meeting. Okay. Okay. All right so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=949)|

| 0:16:10| hope everything is done. What happens to the tiger opening beer? I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| about that. There won't be any. There won't be any. We won't have any drunk tigers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| Okay. All right. Thank you. Next is the muse and this is the Harry Potter play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=982)|
| 0:16:31| date for adults. Okay. Julia Hesse and it's 516 North Beaman Street. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Sergeant Coward? No record. Ms. Dyer? The file is complete. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=997)|
| 0:16:46| Thank you. Do you want to tell us about this? It's a Harry Potter theme. It's 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and up. It's 630 to 930 this Friday and we have all different types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| activities and we're doing wand making, cupcake decorating, tabletop quidditch. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| get to be a kid for the night. Oh sounds good. Thank you. Will we learn spells? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1022)|

| 0:17:10| Okay. All right. The next one on the agenda is the four taproom and we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| to postpone this another 30 days. Mr. Frost, do you want to enlighten us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| the status of the ordinance? Sure. I think we have talked back and forth with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| police department, the law department, and the good folks at POR and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| anticipate on the next council meeting that there will be an ordinance for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| self-serve regulations. All right. Thank you. Then we have a meeting 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| from now to actually handle the permit application. They're not going to be ready to open as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| understand it sooner than May and probably not until June. So it's not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| to hurt their business. As with all construction in an older building, nothing goes without a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| hitch or three. So do I have a motion to defer? All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| Aye. All right. Thank you. Next is Quick Stop Z on Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1090)|

| 0:18:34| permit from the former owner. Okay. Do I hear a motion? Move to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| append, and file documentation. Second. All those in favor? Aye. All right. Is this just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| pretty much a normal convenience store? Yes, gas station convenience store. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1124)|

| 0:19:08| East Town Mall is 3001 and it's suite N01A, which was previously the original arcade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| Okay. Right across from the movie theater. Correct. Yep. Good. Sergeant Coward. No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| Ms. Dyer. We need a copy of the sales tax registration, the building inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| approval, fire prevention approval, and the health department approval. Okay. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| Move to approve, append, and file documentation. Second. All those in favor? Aye. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| Tell us what's going to make this particular location unique because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| familiar with the other Saw Works, but this is obviously not going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| brewing location. Correct. Not a production facility, just a tasting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| that will feature one-off styles, not anything that we have out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| market as far as our flagships go. So all new unique products and getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| the east part of Knoxville, which we're excited to bring craft beer to that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| of town. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Madam Chair, if I could before he leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| Adam. You're the brewer downtown as well, right? Yes. This is an exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| thing for East Town Mall, which I still call it East Town Mall. Maybe some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| call it Knoxville Center, but you know things are changing in the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| environment world. We hear every day about different businesses that can and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| cannot do business in malls, but the new owners are trying different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| concepts, and we applaud you guys for going in there and taking a shot at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| I think it'll make movie theater goers happy. They'll be able to buy their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| ticket and then visit with you for a while before they go see the show. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| that's our thought, too, and we're excited about the opportunity to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| drive the growth over there, and there's some good leadership over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| and we're excited to be a part of it. So thank you. Thanks. Okay. Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| All right. Next is Sorrentino's on Kingston Pike in the former Perkins site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1258)|

| 0:21:30| All right, now tell us about Sorrentino's and how it's, what makes it unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| It's seafood, pasta, and prime steaks. Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| This is my third restaurant in Knoxville. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| I used to own Dazzo's downtown. I used to own Gavino's in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| And now I bought Perkins. Okay. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| And when will you be open for us to come and sample? Hopefully May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Okay. Good luck. Thank you. Thanks for keeping, trying different businesses for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| That's great. Your pizza shop was wonderful. Very good. It's still open, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| It's still open. So I must be doing something right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Even when you're not there, it's open. This one I'm keeping. Thanks, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1326)|

| 0:22:21| I'm Joseph Smith, 10001 Walleye Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Okay. Sergeant Coward. We're missing fingerprints and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| Okay. Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| I need building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Okay. We're going to have to postpone this for 30 days until the records check is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| It's scheduled for Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1365)|

| 0:22:53| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1373)|

| 0:23:02| All right. Thank you. Do you want to tell us about Taft on Cumberland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| The location I've chosen is a former location of a coffee shop that opened back in 1995 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| and I renovated that building then and have recently purchased that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| And, you know, we're looking forward to the new business as a craft beer store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| We'll be selling draft beer on site, bottled beer, and crawlers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| which is a new canning process of sending our customers home with a package of beer in a sealed can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| And, of course, kegs as well for people who are looking to entertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| All right. Sounds like you've got it covered. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1424)|

| 0:24:05| Missing fingerprints, background check, and task expired February 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| This is not until April 29th, so if we defer this until the April 25th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| you'll be on pins and needles about getting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| but as long as you've got the task class and particularly the fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| and all the other things done, you'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| All right. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1472)|

| 0:24:56| Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| The former permit needs to be surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| But everything else is good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Great. Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1502)|

| 0:25:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| All right. Is Union Jacks going to be any different than it has been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| No, ma'am. We're going to keep it pretty much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| We're just going to clean it up and make things operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| There are those who think that would be a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Yeah. It's been around for 20 years, and everybody knows about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| It's a good concept, just filthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Not anymore, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1527)|

| 0:25:32| Some of us like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| I know. That's why you drink the beer, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Okay. Then we have three addendums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| The first is the Landing House on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| Hi. My name is Zach Land, 1147 Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| All right. Tell us about your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| When is it going to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| We are shooting for mid-May right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| We have some unforeseen delays from December to mid-January that put us over our 90-day limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| So we'd like to have a 60-day extension, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Meanwhile, if you get ready sooner than the 60 days, they're ready to pick up their permit then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1579)|

| 0:26:27| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| So we'll defer this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1589)|

| 0:26:37| And they had also some serious construction problems, and they would like us to postpone this until the April 25th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| and they will be opening in mid-May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1609)|

| 0:26:53| You have it in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Is that table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| It was originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Okay. Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1617)|

| 0:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| We'll get it off the table now, and we'll hear it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1631)|

| 0:27:35| Do you have that ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| We really had a problem with the permits, and we finally got the permits a couple of weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| and they're working on it, and it should be ready in about a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| By a few weeks, like four weeks, eight weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| I would say about two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| So all you need to do then is go by and pick up the permit when all the inspections are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1680)|

| 0:28:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| The next thing we have is we need to extend that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1693)|

| 0:28:15| Motion to extend for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| We now have some administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1702)|

| 0:28:39| TABC four-day suspension, February 19th to the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| They've been to see us, and we took no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| But once we get the notice from the TABC board, we have to invite you to come back so we can see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| So you are now here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Do we need to take any action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1736)|

| 0:29:02| We'll not see you again until you open another Bonefish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| We hope that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1748)|

| 0:29:32| They came to see us on the 28th, and then after they were here to see us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| TABC sent us the notification at which time we needed to invite you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1786)|

| 0:30:05| Next is Bombay Palace on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| While he's coming, they did not renew their permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1808)|
| 0:30:19| and they had a suspension from TABC for that February 26th to the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| We got the notice for them to appear here, but their application with us is active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| They just didn't renew their prior permit and it expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| With TABC, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| And it expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| And they did have a suspension from February 26th to the 28th, and you finished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1845)|

| 0:30:48| You have all your permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1848)|

| 0:30:51| We're not going to have any more issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1851)|

| 0:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Well, thank you for coming tonight, unless there's further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1858)|

| 0:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| There's just one more thing, and then I'll wrap this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Not for you, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| There was a request that we ask people to submit their plan for compliance with their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| regardless of the kind of permit they're applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| And that is now ready, I believe, to come to counsel and then to be attached to the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1879)|
| 0:31:27| So we have moved forward on that particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| We're doing it already for special permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| And now everybody will have to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Yeah, I think it's a good exercise for them to think about how they're going to deal with this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| That was pretty much what we seem to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Yeah, I'm just curious where we are in the process of reviewing the fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and are we going to look at that later this summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| Well, you've got the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Are we supposed to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| You could respond to Savannah or Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Are you looking for our suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| It's for first violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| You know, she sent us all those different cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| So you want us to respond kind of like a poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Yeah, you need to read through that and anything that you thought was extreme or excessive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| but something that you liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| And if we have five people say, well, let's find them $2,000 on the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| then we could bring that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I'm not anticipating anybody will say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| But just in case, you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| The county has increased their fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| To what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| $1,500 on the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I just didn't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So we'll just take that, read it, and then submit our comments and suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| recommendations back to Will or Mr. Frost, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| We'll get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Because we do need to move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| There being no other business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd170328?start=1975)|
