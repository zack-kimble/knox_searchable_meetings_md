| 0:02:30| We're able to discuss both pending litigation and anticipated litigation. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=150)|

| 0:02:55| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Mr. Watson. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=178)|

| 0:03:43| Since this work session is his first official meeting with us, I wanted to take just a moment to welcome him and share a little bit of information about Raymond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=223)|

| 0:04:54| Raymond is a paid instructor, a paid assistant instructor, at Boone's Martial Arts Center and earned, I'm not sure how to pronounce these, a wonderful black belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=294)|
| 0:05:08| I couldn't even tell. You'll have to tell us in just a moment. You can pronounce this for me because I'm not even going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| After only eight years of practice, that sounds pretty impressive, he earned the highest superior ranking for six consecutive years for piano at the National Federation of Music Clubs Festival Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=315)|
| 0:05:27| and advanced to the Tennessee Music Teacher Association Senior Piano Competition after receiving a superior ranking from the Knoxville Music Teacher Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=327)|

| 0:06:06| and writing letters of encouragement to support the elderly in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| Raymond, we'd like to welcome you to the board and we all look forward to serving with you over the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you so much for being here today and congratulations on all of your accomplishments thus far. We're happy you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Would you like to pronounce the thing that I couldn't pronounce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| I'm not being sure of the exact naming of it. Essentially it's just third degree vodka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| Okay, okay. I can say that, third degree vodka. That's not what it says on my paper, just so everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=399)|
| 0:06:51| I could have pronounced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| Okay, thank you very much. And now I'd like to refer to Ms. Owen for our vision and mission spotlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=414)|
| 0:07:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=421)|
| 0:07:24| In talking about our mission and vision, our vision is to grow lifelong learners who contribute their talents, strengths, and skills to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=444)|
| 0:07:33| And our mission is to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| The Teacher Supply Depot plays into that mission and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| The depot is a collection center and warehouse of donated new and used classroom materials provided free of charge for teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| teaching assistants, and other school personnel in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| The depot is open to Knox County Schools educators four times each school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| and it's located on Cedar Bluff Road behind Cedar Bluff Preschool, which is the former Cedar Bluff Intermediate building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| Since its beginning 20 years ago, many businesses and community members have donated materials, money, and time to the depot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| allowing our educators to receive literally millions of dollars worth of materials and equipment for their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| Making the Teacher Supply Depot a very important part of filling a little bit of that gap between what is needed in our classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| and what we're able to supply with our local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Many teachers remember the days when we could fill one green bucket with supplies at the Teacher Supply Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| Teachers used to arrive before dawn and wait in line for hours to collect classroom supplies from the depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| In the early years, this was necessary because popular items like markers and pencils ran out quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| Thanks to space provided by Knox County Schools and increased supplies provided by donors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| the depot is now also open to teaching assistants and other support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| and they're no longer limited to one green bucket of supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| I'm not sure if you can see it there, but she had a whole shopping cart full, and those shopping carts were also donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| Items are organized now. They are spread out and very easy to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| Pandemic protocols brought on additional adjustments, and as the depot board and staff worked hard to find ways to limit numbers inside the depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| while still having well-attended openings, they also found ways to make sign-in and check-out go more smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| With increased supplies, more space, and the ability to have our teaching staff sign up for a shopping time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| it actually eliminated that long line and any reason for teachers to have to set an alarm for 4 a.m. on a Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| to go and get just a bucket of supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| So they now have lots and lots of supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| People don't have to show up at the crack of dawn to hope to get anything because the supplies are there all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| They sign up for a time to go in. They don't have to stand out and wait in that long line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| They have an assigned time for just so many people to shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| It's very organized, much easier, and the depot board is continuing to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| That's part of their lifelong learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| They're continuing to learn from the process and find other ways and bring other things to teachers as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| and hopefully there are going to be some new processes also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| In the fall, I'll update you with when those openings will actually be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| Those are tentative dates right now, so I don't want to put those out and confuse people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| So in the fall, I'll update you with the actual dates and let you know when you can come by and see that process happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| It's pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| That's great that they've made some improvements so that teachers don't have to spend the entire day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| That's fantastic to hear. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Okay, and now I'd like to refer to Mr. Thomas for the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Several updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| I'm very grateful for the tremendous efforts of our students, families, and employees during the school year that ended last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| Despite the enormous challenges of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| school communities worked together to ensure that our educational mission continued to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| We are working very diligently to prepare for the 21-22 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| I know the KCS community is eager to know more about what that will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| As always, we will continue to consult with the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| and review guidance from the Tennessee Department of Education and the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| If circumstances related to COVID-19 change, we will respond promptly in coordination with these agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| However, at this time, our expectation is the COVID-19 restrictions implemented a year ago will not be in place for the 21-22 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=706)|
| 0:11:57| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| Specifically, that means that masks will not be required for students, teachers, employees, or visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| although they may be allowed at each individual's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| Temperature checks will not be required for students, employees, or visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Knox County schools will not contact trace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| Visitors will be allowed in schools, and extracurricular activities and field trips will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| Please note that the KCS will continue to make use of Chromebooks provided to all K-12 students through the district's 1-to-1 initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| In-person students should continue bringing their fully charged Chromebooks to class every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| I also want to point out that the district will receive approximately $114 million from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, also known as ESSER 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| We are encouraging families, students, employees, and other stakeholders to complete the online survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| that can be found at knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Again, that is knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| As of last night, we had more than 12,000 responses submitted to the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| so I want to thank everyone who has participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| I think that's great, but there's still one more day tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| The survey closes tomorrow, July 1st, at 1159 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| so I would encourage everyone who has not filled out the survey to do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| In addition, I was very pleased that the Tennessee Department of Education approved our request to operate three virtual schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| in the 21-22 school year, one each for elementary, middle, and high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=812)|

| 0:14:24| I know our students and staff are really excited about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| and if you're counting, it's 39 days from tomorrow, so the countdown has begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| So, looking forward to seeing all of our students back in class on August 9th for a half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. That concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Any questions or comments? Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you, Madam Chair. Superintendent, I know I've seen you out and about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| getting some of the community feedback with the ESSER funds. How do you feel like that's going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| And I noticed at both meetings that I was at, the community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| we didn't really have much student representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Are we hearing from students? Are students filling out the survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| I am not sure on student participation. I know we had family, the family advisory participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| The surveys available for students, we encourage students to fill out the survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| and we can get input that way, but I'm not sure if there was a formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| John, do you know of a formal meeting for students like we've had on community meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| There's not a, no sir, there's not a formal focus group meeting for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| but I do know that, and we don't have the results of the survey because it's still open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| but from what we've heard from talking to our facilitators that they're coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| probably about the same rate as parents as what we heard early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| So, I think they're choosing to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| All right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Okay, we'll move into discussion of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| Any questions on items in contracts one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| I don't really have a question for item two, but I did want to say thank you to Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| Are we on the contracts there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| For number two, it's regarding the Pleasant Ridge community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| and I did have some concerns about the land that would be taken from the school grounds there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| and Mr. Oaks was very diligent, and thank you for your answers back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Some of the community was concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| would the school be compensated for some of the land that was lost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| The traffic patterns, was it going to affect their parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| And the intent is for funds to go back to the school parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| and traffic patterns will not be affected long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| So, just thank you to the staff for all the hard work they do in answering our questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| and the concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| Item three, any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| I'll just say that I've heard from some community members who are concerned about just the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| of being termed the medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| so I was curious as to whether board members felt like we needed any additional language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| that specified that this is an advisory role only with power outside of a normal day-to-day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1035)|
| 0:17:25| that would have to come before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| So, I've heard from some parents who had a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| so I'm just wondering if anybody has any thoughts on that, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| I've heard from parents as well with the same concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| and so I have the same question as you actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| and I think if anything we've seen in the past year that we've relied on one or two voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| and I'd like to see the scope broadened a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| And, you know, in here it says consultation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| and I'd like to stress that we're consultation in the document as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1070)|
| 0:17:58| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| I have not heard from parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| so I'm curious as to what the larger implications of the title being medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| and also what other suggestions are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| I asked specifically the parents that I heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| I asked specifically what part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| because I think for the most part this is a job description that specifies what is actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| So, the concern that I heard was really around the term being used as medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| and so that's at the very top of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| and then also later on it says by signing below the parties agree to the scope of services for the medical director for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1114)|
| 0:18:44| I think their concern was whether that provides additional oversight that hasn't been there in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| is the way I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| That's the feedback that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| Yeah, I'm bringing the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| and so that's why I wasn't necessarily asking board members about changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| My thought was perhaps if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1153)|
| 0:19:17| and I'm assuming that we would need to see if the health department is agreeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| that to just adding language that talks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| that makes specific reference to the fact that this is an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| So, that's kind of where my thoughts were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| I think Ms. Bounds and then Mr. Watson and then Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Yes, my question would be, I don't know, for Bob or maybe Gary, to kind of fill me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| I don't know if I missed something about how this has come about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| why Dr. Buchanan feels this is necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| and exactly I understand maybe, I hope I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| the need to sign off for the nurses working under someone just as a nurse practitioner would work under a physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1198)|
| 0:20:07| but can somebody give me the history of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| and why at this time we have this document that we're reviewing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| Mr. Duke, would you like to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Sure, I'll take a crack at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| So, I'm not going to pretend to speak for Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| but what I can say is that Dr. Buchanan and her office sent this over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| to formalize a relationship that has existed for numerous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| but it's not been formalized before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| So, I think, and again, I hate to suppose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| but part of the conversation was, you know, with all the confusion that has gone about with COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1250)|
| 0:20:59| felt like that it was a good time to, again, formalize what's already been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| And if you look at the Tennessee law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Tennessee law states that a physician should be overseeing nurses in this type of capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| simply to allow the nurses to practice nursing legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| So, I mean, that's really the purpose of her involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| and it's my understanding that the health department has been involved for, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| for many, many years even before Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| So, and we reviewed the language, and we felt like, again, it says consultation throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1297)|
| 0:21:46| It says, you know, advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| So, I mean, it's not a, it's not, it is, it reads more like a job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| and it's certainly not overstepping in that bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| Thank you, Mr. Dudley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| That was part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| I was asking if this was something that got approved annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| but it sounds like it's a new document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| I know when I read the term medical director, I never had a parent reach out to me about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| but it was a little confusing in terms of what was intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| And you referenced, it's referenced in here that state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| it says state law nurses may practice under protocols approved by an MD or DO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| So, because it's referenced that way in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| is that one of the reasons why it needs to be titled in a certain way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Yes, thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| There are several statutes that come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| but one of them specifically, TCA 63-7-108,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| actually uses the term the physician directs the nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| So, I mean, that's likely where the term director came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I can't say for sure, but I can tell you that that term does appear in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Sure, but we're not limited to medical director for the purpose of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| It could be something else and still suffice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| And I think it was mentioned, we may want to talk to Dr. Buchanan about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| but not that I'm aware of right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Yeah, I got one email about it, but to me this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| and maybe I know the nurses work under, I think, Jason, is it under you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| To me this does just seem like probably a document that does need to be in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| of the fact that I would think we do need some kind of medical authority that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| you know, I look at some of these things like the AD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| and just some of these things that are very general that are medical things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| So, I mean, I didn't know if you could sort of talk to, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| do we feel like we need some kind of medical person above it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| or maybe there's actually the state law that kind of requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| I mean, I personally couldn't really figure out what the problem was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| and why I had the concerned email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| because I personally didn't have a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Yeah, so the conversation about formalizing this relationship with Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| actually preexisted COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| It was one of the first conversations I actually had with Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| was that we really needed to sort of formalize what this looked like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| and part of that was is I guess where it really turned its head was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| we had an air quality alert in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| and I had been on the job for about a week and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| and somebody said, call Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| and see if she thinks kids should be on the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| And so I call her and she was like, who are you again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| But essentially her position on that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| and I know that, you know, COVID changed the way that people perceive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| a lot of the work being done with our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| But her response was, nice to meet you, Mr. Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| but that's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| That's the school system's decision, not the health department's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| So she has always taken the position that it is consultative, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| So the experience that we've had with COVID-19 is very much an outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| And what Mr. Dupler says regarding the title of medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| as far as I can tell, that's just the title that one has when they do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| So for example, if a nursing home doesn't have an in-house MD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| the person that they contact with has the title medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| So that's the person who gives, under the state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| that's the person who gives the nurses the authority to act with autonomy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| within the school building to deliver medical care to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| So I know that the timing of this coming to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| feels very connected to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| But the fact is, the conversation around formalizing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| and making it a bit more clear predated COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| I think that she saw my entry into this role as an opportunity to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| hey, this person has no preexisting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| like we need to make it clear for both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| how this relationship is supposed to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| So, you know, the only real concrete things in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| is how they support our AED program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| The other things are purely consultative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| and then her authority giving the nurses the ability to do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| And I appreciate that, Jason, because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| and I thank you for acknowledging that it's kind of coming on the heels of post-COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| which kind of makes people look at it a little bit differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| based on Dr. Buchanan's past performance over the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| and some people who found it less than favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| And I assume this is a position that's not compensated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| so we would have trouble finding someone to serve over all the nurses in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| if it was not Dr. Buchanan, who is already in position as the head of the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| and thereby she can do this and we don't have to hire a physician to oversee or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1634)|
| 0:27:24| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| She's the, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| I guess my question, Mr. Myers, is outside of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| I think it's probably also important to point out there are other illnesses that we deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| like in the instance that someone might have meningitis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| and we have staff and student exposures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| and that might require, you know, a prescription or medication to prevent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| and they might not have the health care provider to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| And this isn't just students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| I'm assuming this goes for staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| So, yeah, I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| And again, you know, as Mr. Thomas said in his update, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| as we transition to a new school year, I think the goal for the Knox County schools is to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| safely move forward in a more standard means of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| and what you described with other illnesses is very much the way that our partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| with the health department has traditionally worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| And I think it's important for us to recognize that's the direction that we're trying to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| We're trying to get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| And that's why that relationship with the health department is so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| because you start talking about rare illnesses such as meningitis and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| You know, that partnership with them is what allows us to know that we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| It's in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| It helps guide our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| You know, we made some changes in terms of contact tracing with nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and things inside our buildings that we had never done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| And we're trying to get back to where a more standard means of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| and what you described is pretty spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Moving to items 4 or 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| 6 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| 8 or 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| 10 or 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| 12 or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| And then the last three, 14, 15, 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| Any questions on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Moving to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Questions on A or B, C or D, E, F, or G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1793)|
| 0:30:04| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| On E, just a technical issue, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| I'm pretty sure that the wrong fiscal note is attached online to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| On E, it references a fiscal note that's not associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| And then also I have a question about the grant itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| It's for 21-22, but all the background information dates back to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| Do we know if the program has changed since 2019 when that documentation was created?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| Dr. Reiser, do you have any information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| I'm making sure I'm on the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| Is E one of the questions about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I was catching up quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| We were moving through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| So it's a continuation of the program that provides tutoring after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| So there haven't been major changes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| This is 21st century grant dollars that provide tutoring at those schools for students after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| So the thing that was confusing to me is because we had language that was dated back from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| this was not a grant that was originally filed in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| That's just the most recent documentation associated with this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| So we have various grants like this, and they come due at different times for different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| So every few years these come through, and this is just this set of schools for this given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| So I think it's just kind of a formatted contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| It's basically the same, just provided at different schools, and they run out at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Moving to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Questions on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about this since it seems like it's benchmark assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| and it's more customized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I mean, just what it's going to do versus what we've already been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| I just would love a little bit more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Dr. Reisnick, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| So this is a couple things with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| We're actually pretty excited about this in conversation with principals we are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| So as you all know, the data source we typically get is the end-of-the-year data that we get through students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| who are taking the TCAPs or the TN Ready tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| We haven't had much to do as far as getting kind of real-time data for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| Case 21 is an assessment that we learned about actually a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| Maryville City used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Germantown used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Some other districts like that just started out that were really using it to look at their ACT scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| It's basically a quick 30-minute to 45-minute, three times a year, digital assessment that looks and aligns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| very tightly with proficiency standards at the state and then also aligns very closely with ACT predictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1980)|
| 0:33:08| So, again, in talking to our principals, we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| We haven't had a tool like this in a while that we can actually see how kids are performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| So there's no tie to evaluation, no tie to any of those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| The idea would be that we can kind of see this is where students should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| The database for Case 21 is pretty robust so it can kind of predict where students are and where they fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| And that information is turned around, I think it's 72 hours, it gets turned back around to the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| so that they have that to be able to focus kind of their reteaching on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| Another thing that we'll be using this for is part of ESSER does have a monitoring requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| that the strategies we put into that are actually working and we have proof of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| or they're not working and we can modify from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| So one of our plans is to use that as well to be able to track kind of district-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| and pull that up and see how we're doing on the learning loss and closing those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| What grades are able to be assessed with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So we actually have this written in for K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| This initial one is the K-8 and then they also have high school versions too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| So that's our hope to potentially, if that's what the input shows a need for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| that we could write that into our 9-12 as well and give us a prediction for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Again, just in some early conversations with principals around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| a lot have been asking for this so that we can kind of know prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| So they're pretty excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you, Dr. Resnick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Moving to our regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Superintendent or maybe Scott, I'm not sure who this will go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| but I like this plan in place and I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| how did we come up with the numbers and the formula?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| Is it based in, like, examples from different districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| or just kind of works specifically here for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Like, what's the evidence behind, like, this is what we should do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Probably Scott can address that a little bit better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| but again, just looking at our situation in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| because every district will turn in something maybe different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| and we don't see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| I guess we could ask to see them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| but it's just based on Knox County and what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| in terms of a different plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| The state asks for this every year for us to, the board, approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| and I don't know, Scott, if you've got anything else to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| It's basically based on historical data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| We get a projection of what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| We do have to reflect out what we paid in previous fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| so that kind of gives us a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| If you look at it compared to last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| you'll see a change in how those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| those numbers may change from one year to the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| but it's a little historical data that we report out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| and things that we try to project out based on trends in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Scott, I'm not going to ask you all the questions that I asked before on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| but can you speak a little bit anecdotally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| to some of the benefit of a differentiated plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Just take an example or two about some of the things it's done for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| at Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| As you know, when you look at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| the competition in school districts that surround us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| we're looking at places that are able to compensate at higher levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| Now, those are typically smaller municipal districts that do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| What this does is this allows us a competitive edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| over some of those districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| along with some districts in close proximity to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| We provide a signing bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| and just anecdotally speaking a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| as a matter of fact it was in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| we kind of separated out as a pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| a special education kind of incentive program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| where we increased it from $5,000 to $7,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| paid out over three years, or $7,000 paid out over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| We have seen a great amount of success in that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| in a sense that finding special ed teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| are no longer as difficult as it once was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| That may be attributed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| That may also be attributed to the fact that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| we started the aspiring teachers program with UTK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| as part of that MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| so we automatically had 11 candidates to fill positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| So there's a lot of things that we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| in those areas of high need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| And given these opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| it allows for us to even staff strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| those schools that are more difficult to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| I appreciate you bringing up the special ed example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| I was on a call, a national call today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| with Georgetown Ed Finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| and one of the things that they were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| is across the country we're having a hard time staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| especially right now special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| What are you seeing related to the new positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| that we just approved in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| because we approved a lot of new special ed positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Are we having a hard time filling those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Actually, by my numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| and speaking with the special ed department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| I think we're in better shape than we have been in some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| even given the fact that we are increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| the number of SPED teaching positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| above what we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you. Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| My question is probably a little bit out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| but since we're bugging Mr. Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I'm going to go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| It's kind of piggybacking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| We did expand to our ability to hire social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| and behavioral people, I felt, and counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| I was just wondering, because my big concern was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| do we have the people out there to actually fill the positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I was just trying to see from your standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| how we feel like we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Again, there's a nationwide shortage in those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| but I feel like this gives us a leg up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| There's a lot of districts, again, that surround us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| that are competing for the same candidate pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| that gives us the edge in getting those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Now we do have an increase in counseling positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| and things like that, and I think that is an area of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| I think this helps us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| I don't think it's a perfect remedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| but it gets us closer to solving those vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Okay, any other questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Okay, moving to item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| First, Superintendent, I appreciate your and your team's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| engaging with Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas and their team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| to keep KPD at the table with us at KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Can you just outline briefly kind of the steps that were taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| to get to this MOA, this draft MOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| Yes, sir, thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| In terms of getting to where we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| obviously we talked about this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| but we had two meetings with the mayor, our team and the mayor's team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| The first meeting I think we had on June 3rd, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| and what we tried to do at that meeting was to explain to Mayor Kincannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| a lot of things in terms of how SSOs and SROs interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| and what SROs can do that maybe SSOs can't do and then vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| So a very good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| The mayor asked us quite a few questions, but it was a productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| Once we left that meeting, we had a meeting on June 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| with the mayor and her team and our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| At that meeting, the mayor had basically listened to what we had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| and looked at the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I know she indicated that she had looked at board workshop meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| and board meetings and put together the MOA that's in front of you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| made a few changes that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Some of the changes in there we're already doing in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| so it just helps to maybe formalize, document those actions that are being taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2455)|
| 0:41:04| Once we left that meeting, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| the city law department was represented in that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| So once we left that meeting, we asked Mr. Dupler to contact the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| which he did, and got a draft of the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| At that point, we sat down with our team, went through with Mr. Dupler and our team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| went through the MOA, the changes, talked about those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Actually, Mr. Dupler, I think, then emailed the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| with some changes that we recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Some of those changes, revisions were adopted, some were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| but basically we can live with everything that's in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| And the main objective for me was to have something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| so that our schools, our former city schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| our schools within the city limits of Knoxville had school resource officers in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| So I can't thank Mayor Kincannon enough for her willingness to meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| and to listen to us and to come back with an agreement that allowed that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| So I certainly want to reach out to her and to her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| for their willingness to work with us and put together this MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| that will allow the officers to be back in our schools when school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| So I know that Chief Pedousis was a part of some of those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| and I'm going to not pronounce his last name right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| so I'm going to say Incoming Chief Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Has he been able to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I know he's not starting until August 1st, but just curious if he's been able to reflect on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Yeah, I had a little trouble with the name too, but very simply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| State Perriard, just like it spells and sounds, so Chief Perriard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| He actually, or Incoming Chief, yes, Chief Pedousis was in both meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| and fortunately Incoming Chief Perriard was in town in Knoxville for a couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| and was able to join us in the second meeting with the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| and Chief Perriard or Incoming Chief Perriard, I should say, met with Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| also met with the Sheriff to make those introductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| and to let him know, make those relationships, to get started on those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| So he has not officially or formally been involved other than he was at that second meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| when Mayor Kincannon actually took us through the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| He officially starts on August 1, I believe, so whether or not he's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| I feel sure he's probably looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| I know he's got some ideas about a couple of things, the de-escalation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| in terms of looking at de-escalation in situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| Also, communication protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| If more than one law enforcement department is at a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| what are those communication protocols going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Who's going to be in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| Just some things that I think are going to be some improvements to the MOA from our side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| and also with our law enforcement partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| I do have a few more questions, but I'll defer to Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Okay, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Yeah, I just, I unfortunately cannot be here on the voting meeting for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| but I am very happy that we have been able to work with the city to get something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| because I literally, when I go out in public, get stopped by people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| very concerned about the fact that they didn't feel we might have security coming for the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| So I am really happy at this point that we're going to be able to get something in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| I hope, if we vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| But I can't vote on it, but I am very much in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| And if I, just real quick before we go back to Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| one concern I had is just the way this sounds on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| under school security division and school security officer duties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| number six says SSO, so our school security officers will receive the equivalent of 40 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| of the school resource officer training course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| To me, that makes it sound like that our officers are having a week's worth of training and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| So I know that is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Our officers go through a nine- to ten-week academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| They have additional training every year of 60 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| They have another 18 hours of unscheduled service training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| So that's just kind of a concern to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| that it just makes it sound like our officers don't have the type of training they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| So that's kind of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| Back to you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Mr. Dupler, can you speak to any potential challenges with having two different MOAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| one that informs our work with KCSO and one that informs our work with KPD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2761)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| I don't know that I can speak greatly to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I mean, ideally we would have one agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| but it's also my understanding that if you've got a school within the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| they'll be operating under this proposed MOU if it passes, or MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| and then if you've got a school outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| then they would be operating under the existing MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| So all I can say is that if the board wants to accept this particular proposed MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2797)|
| 0:46:46| it is in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| It's up to the board as to whether or not you feel like the school system can handle it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| and handle the differences in the policies within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| So I know there's not many changes from the original MOA that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| Could you briefly highlight just the changes for the public and the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| because there's not many in terms of what those changes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Yes, I can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Of course, initially it talks about the fact that this is only with the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2834)|
| 0:47:22| and the city and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| So I had some discussion with Ron Mills with the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| about the jurisdictional authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| and we felt like that was resolved, I mean, certainly appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| and, I mean, to everybody's satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| And then there was some differences with regard to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| Special education was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Yes, special education was definitely one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| There was another one before that, though, talking about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| Hang on a second, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| Yeah, it's under principal's duties, talking about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| And number seven, under principal's duties, talking about minor property crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| That's a slight change from the existing MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| because the existing MOA talks about vandalism and simple assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| You know, I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| I don't want to suppose anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| You know, this language came from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| and they felt like that that was appropriate language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| but you ask for a change, and that was a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| They also added the language in that same section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| talking about proper course of action on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| and the need to correct the student's behavior in the least intrusive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| while following state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| So that was language that they wanted in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| And then probably the biggest change...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Well, there's two more probably significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| There might have been a word or two here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| but on page five, under Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| duties and responsibilities, under seven, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| it talked about special needs students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| Originally, that was all their language that they had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| That was a new section from the prior MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| and then our office and Superintendent Thomas and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| asked for some additional language, which they did agree to put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| others in imminent danger of significant injury or loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| So that was added at our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| And then in the conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| the first part of that paragraph was language that was proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| you know, by the city, and that's new language as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I just think it's important for the public to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| where those changes came from, that this is not a brand-new document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| that I would think that they started with the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| that they were pulling out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| and that there were some changes that were suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| I do think there's some difficulty for parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| when there's two separate MOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| I can easily envision a parent with a school or a kid in a city school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| and a kid in a county school at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| and potentially both with special needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| and how is this kid going to interact versus this kid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| I can also see where when kids are moving across grade bands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| and they might be in a zoned school that's in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| and now they're shifting to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| So I think for the purpose of our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| for the parents in the community to have one operating agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| seems to be the ideal long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| The only people that I had, the people that spoke out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| and reached out to me when they saw this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| the feeling was, so does this mean that Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| doesn't want to hear from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I mean, that's a lot of what our conversation has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| over the last two months related to this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| is trying to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| I know I wasn't able to be at the board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| on the 6th or whenever that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| but I did get to watch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and I know that the board approved not hiring a third-party facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| but I don't think the board in that meeting, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| did not say that it didn't want to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| So I guess what I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| and I guess I'm asking it of you, Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| because I know that you and your team kind of took the lead on drafting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| which again, or not drafting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| but working with the city to get to an agreement, which I appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| is, is the intent that this, if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| kind of shuts the door on our agreements with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| for this season until the next time it comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| or is the intent that we would still want to hear from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| on issues related to school safety and security in this MOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I've been waiting on an answer to that question for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| Like I've said, I'm open to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| I'm open to listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I know that several groups have expressed an interest in having some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| I don't know how you start that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| without going to the community with a document and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| here's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| So what's important in terms of changes that you want to make to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| We cannot tell law enforcement what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| I mean, that's just as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I mean, if a crime is committed, whether it's on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| or my property or anybody else's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| law enforcement is going to do what law enforcement is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Again, when we had this conversation on May 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| the suggestion was made, hey, hire a facilitator and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| which I thought was a good suggestion because somebody that's trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| in facilitating something like that and being objective in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| obviously is better than us doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| But we will do whatever you want us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I think community input is important on it, so I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| But if board members say, hey, we've got an MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| and we want to move forward, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| But we've got a new chief coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| We've got a new mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| The new mayor has already weighed in on it some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I just had a very brief conversation with the sheriff about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| He's open to looking at the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| and if we can make any improvements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| I feel like he would be receptive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| One thing he told me he did not want is somebody coming in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| telling him how to enforce the law in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| So he said, that's the job I've been elected to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| and that's what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| But that's not to say he would not be open to looking at the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| and making some changes if it improves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| To me, it's all about getting better every day at what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| So this document's been in place for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| I think it's worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| We've had some issues, and I think when we've looked at the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| we've tried to make some corrections there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| I'm certainly open and receptive, and our team is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| to looking at it more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| But I think if we're going to involve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I think you have to have something to take to the community to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| here's what it is, what are your objections with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| and to get that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| I'm just a little bit frustrated at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| Not to the point where I won't do what you tell me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Obviously, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| But just give us some direction and let us move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| We're trying to open school, hire principals, get kids back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| hire teachers, and a whole lot of things that are very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| to increasing student achievement, eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| and building a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| So we've spent just a huge amount of time on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and I'm ready to move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| whether that's get community input or, hey, this is a document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| and let's go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Now, probably said a whole lot more than anybody wanted me to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| but you ask, and that's my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Do you have another question, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| I was just going to express my appreciation and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| and your staff for the willingness to meet with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| and to put forth an effort with this MOA to have it in place prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| to school starting, as I think, Ms. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| were you the one that commented about the public being concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| from the officers being pulled from the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| I personally don't see a problem with two different MOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| These are two different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| I think it's kind of like what we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| I think it's easier sometimes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| rather than trying to get everybody to agree at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| it's easier to work individually with different law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| So I don't see a problem as far as two different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| We can continue to tweak this as we go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| but I'm just very thankful that we did a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| maybe I should choose my words better, but make a mountain out of a mohill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| I think Ms. Christie was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| I would just like to say that any conversation that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3422)|
| 0:57:11| I feel like our new security chief needs to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| I think that these are the conversations that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| he's the one that has to establish his working relationship with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| outside law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| And, you know, he might have other ideas about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| and maybe this is something that he can work on and discuss with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| When you say you would like to have a document to take to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| is that something we could ask him to do when he comes on board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I don't really necessarily have much about the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| I do wish we had community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| but I understand taking something to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| But I'm highly offended by you, Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| and Board Member Babba saying this is a mountain over whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| how much time we spent on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| because what I saw was an officer go into a school, manhunt a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| and kill a kid in the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| That's what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| And so however amount of time we need to spend to make sure that never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| happens again, that's how much time we need to spend on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| But that's what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| I saw an officer of KPD come into a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| did not give any notice to the principal or whatever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| and they killed a kid in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| So we should spend as much time as possible to make sure we never have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| that happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| I do think the comment around time, and Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| you and I have talked a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| I get your frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| I think, I mean, from what I've talked to you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| it's more about not clarity about which direction to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| I mean, we all know how much time we spent on some other issues over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| past year, and so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| we certainly have not spent as much time on this issue as some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| other pervasive issues that this Board has dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| I have spoken to, I spoke to Mayor Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| and I just wanted to be clear that, from my understanding from her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| and Superintendent, you may have a different feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| but I don't know that she's opposed to continued engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| around the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| I mean, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| I'm open to a continued community engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| I started this conversation back in May, I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| and, Superintendent, you know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| I mean, not from me or anybody else on this Board was this an attempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| who has supported this, an attempt to tell law enforcement what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| I mean, that's not been the driving perception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| and I know certain folks in law enforcement, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| get antsy when they feel like people are trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| That's not what this has been about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| This has been about, these are our community's kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| and our community should have an opportunity to weigh into the agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| that we have with local law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| It's as simple as that. That's what this has been about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| And so, again, I appreciate the work to get to this place with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| I appreciate the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| I really value the change around special ed, special needs students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| Having one myself and imagining how he's going to interact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| potentially, with law enforcement in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| But I do think that if there's not an opportunity to hear from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| in some regard, it's one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| There were several, actually, in the meeting that I wasn't at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| again, I listened to it, there were several comments that were made about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| I think it was you, Ms. Babb, you talked about how the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| sometimes doesn't trust KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| You even made the comment, you said, I trust KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| but some in the community do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| It's because of situations like this when we say out of one side of our mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| we want to invite the community to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| and then at the other end we actually don't act on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| we actually don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| That's a really good way to hurt the perception of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| that you really want to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| I just wanted to apologize to my colleague, Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| and my words were probably not the best choice, Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| and my point to all of this, and I think this has been a good discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| and my point to it was I'm glad we have something in place going into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| I mean, we're, I think you said earlier, 39 days away from school starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| So, I'm glad that, you know, KPD and KCS was able to get something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3702)|
| 1:01:53| I agree with my colleague, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| I think it's highly important with us taking a new direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| with Chief Badoosa's leaving, that we get input from the new person coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3721)|
| 1:02:08| and not that I'm opposed to not continuing this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| but I do agree with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| It's helpful to have something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| It's helpful to have a starting point and to work from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| And we can get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| But, anyway, I just wanted you to understand that my choice of words were probably wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| It was more to the point that we've got something going into August in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| Could it be better? Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| But we can work on it to do that as we go forward with a new chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| and with community input if that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| So, anyway, I just wanted you to know that I didn't mean to minimize the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Thank you, Ms. Pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Yeah, just kind of addressing all this, I am happy we have got this in place right now just to start school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| because I think that was just a huge concern over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Starting school, I think we've got something to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| I do, several people have talked about it, but I do think with a new chief coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| I do want his input, but I do want community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| and I think we kind of have all talked different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| I did like the facilitator idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I just went to the two ESSER meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| It was kind of neat to see how these facilitators got conversation going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| that I really got a lot out of listening to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| But as a board, we've decided not to go in that direction, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| I mean, I support that we as a board are going to move on to a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| but I think once we get school going, we get the new chief in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| and give him a couple of weeks to settle in and figure out his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| and not get him to have to do this the first day on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| But I do think this fall I would like to look at ways to have community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| however those work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| I as a school board member will be happy to take a lead on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| on trying to figure out a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| But I think this fall doing it and then we've got these two agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| and we can go to the community and figure out if we need to stick with two different agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| or if we can combine them into one and maybe come up with something that can work for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| So I hope that we can all move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| But like I said, I'm very happy that we're starting school with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you, Ms. Babb. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| I appreciate Superintendent Thomas and Ms. Bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| your comment about bringing something to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| I also want to just point out the fact we have an MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| We do have something to bring to the community to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| We don't need to make up something new to bring to the community to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| And then also I completely agree with having the incoming chief involved in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3882)|
| 1:04:49| And I think I even referenced that in the beginning that we were going to have a new chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| and they need to be at the table and fully engaged in whatever we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| Superintendent Thomas, have you had any conversation with the Sheriff about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| I mean, to me these changes are fairly minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| They don't seem earth shattering, but they do seem helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Have you had any conversation with the Sheriff about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| would you be willing to shift in these four relatively minor areas to have some consistency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3918)|
| 1:05:27| I have not talked to him yet, but if the board approves this MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| then I'll certainly meet with the Sheriff and say here are some changes that have been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| I don't think there's anything controversial about the changes that have been recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| so I think that would be worth a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| And again, my frustration is not over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| Tell me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| If it's community meetings, we'll be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| If you can't hire a facilitator, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| We'll be glad to put that together for you and help and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| But just tell me what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I'll just make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I certainly agree with what's been said about the new chief being included in these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| And as Ms. Babb said, I think to get him here, I'm glad he's already met the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| and whoever Mr. Thomas said that he's already met, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| but I think that he needs to be here and in place so that he can be part of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| And I think it's important to remember that we are elected by our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| to represent our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| So I'm hopeful that each of our communities that elected us trusts us to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| So I think that if board members feel like they need to hear from their specific district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| that you should feel free to have a town hall any time about any subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| So if something comes out of those meetings that needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| that there are issues that are raised, that would be something to take to the superintendent and the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| So that's always an option, whatever the issue is, be it security or academics or whatever the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4030)|
| 1:07:19| So I think it's really important that the public understand that we are representing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| and that they've elected us to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| So that's just my two cents for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Okay, Ms. Babb, we'll move to public forum, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| Okay. Maureen Schoenig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| Schoenig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| If you will come and give your name, county of residence, in five minutes, you have to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| My name is Maureen Schoenig, Knox County, and I'm here for your community input on the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| I want to say thank you to Superintendent Thomas as well as Mayor Kincannon and KPD for reaching such a quick MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4083)|
| 1:08:13| I mean, considering where we were in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I'm a teacher in Knox County schools, and we had very high level of anxiety, as you can imagine, this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| To end the year with knowing that KPD officers might not be in our classrooms just increased that anxiety level, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4103)|
| 1:08:32| We are right now in an extremely violent environment with everything going on, not just in our community but in our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| and I think it's important that we have KPD, and recognizing the importance that they, the role that they play in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| in our community, I'm just so thrilled that we're going to have them back into our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| I did have some questions regarding the roles and responsibilities in this MOA, and forgive me, I did not read the original MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4133)|
| 1:09:00| so I really don't know if this is a change, but one of the roles, the role of the teacher, and I quoted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4140)|
| 1:09:10| the role of the teacher is to respond to inappropriate and unlawful student behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| in a way that supports personal growth and learning opportunities for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| I'm confused. I thought my role as a teacher, if I see unlawful or illegal student behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| was to report that to the authority at the school, whether it's an administration or whether it is an SRO or an SSO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4169)|
| 1:09:37| but that never appears in the MOA at all. Am I incorrect that that's my first role, is to report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4177)|
| 1:09:46| So that was a little confusing. Second of all, the role of the SRO, and this goes back to what Mr. Watson was referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| about the role of SROs in regards to special education students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| It says specifically in item 7 that SROs will not intervene with special education students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| without the specific request of a principal unless there is a chance of significant injury or loss of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| but the term significant injury has not been clearly defined, and you might think, well, that's kind of easy definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4213)|
| 1:10:21| Well, at my school, we have had teachers who've had broken bones because of problems with special education students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4221)|
| 1:10:29| Was that considered significant injury? Is that enough to call in an SRO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4229)|
| 1:10:36| We have occasionally and more than occasionally fights that occur in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| If a fight, and as you know, those happen very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| It's very seldom that you have a pre-warning that a fight is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Every once in a while, they write it on the bathroom wall, but the rest of the time, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| So if a fight's happening in the hallway and it involves a special education student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| does the SRO have the ability to jump in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| Because, face it, most middle school fights don't involve significant injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| If pulling hair or scratching or punching is not significant, what's the role of the SRO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| And how are they to know if a student involved in an altercation in a hallway is indeed a special education student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| We're not walking around with IDs on our foreheads saying what we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| So I think those are a couple areas that we, as a teacher, I would like to see clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| I would really like to see a role as teachers clarified because it does concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| I think that's kind of vague language about supporting the personal growth and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| and yet there doesn't seem to be anything about reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| And also, you know, about the SRO and what their role is with special education students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| I'm very up on the lace on de-escalation. I think that's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| I think a lot of times, you rush in and make the situation worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| So I think the focus on de-escalation is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| I am a little concerned about the case-by-case basis for infractions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| because I think what that does is reduces a standard to an individual level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| And when you do that, you open yourself up to being accused of bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Because if one student creates an infraction and gets one penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| and another student does the same infraction, gets a different penalty, how am I going to justify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| I can't do that in my classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| So you have to have some kind of standard by which personal responsibilities and actions are ruled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4354)|
| 1:12:41| and then perhaps taking into account special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| But having no standard is not really the way to go either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you. I just want to say I appreciate you bringing up some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| from a classroom perspective that we might not otherwise have thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| Tanya Coates, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| Thank you. Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Thank you, Madam Chair and the Board and Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| I want to take this time to tell you that this will possibly be my last one speaking on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| of the Knox County Education Association today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| but I wanted to spend time actually talking about the incoming president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| for the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| We have made some inroads with the Board and we appreciate the collaborative efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| that we've had over the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| We've tried to make sure that you hear the voices of educators in your district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| as well as the students in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| And more importantly, that has been more evident more than ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| is the parents in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| But today I wanted to introduce to you Ms. Paula Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| She is a middle school teacher from Carnes Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| I'm going to ask her if she can come stand up here beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| But she has spent her career over 20 years in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| in support of all the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| She is a math teacher, so the difference between her is I talk a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| and she calculates a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| She will do us justice as educators in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| that she will be representing all the educators of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| as our memorandum of understanding that still stays in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| that we represent all of our educators in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| our professional educators in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| And we're hoping that I know that she will do her well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| because she treated me so very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| and that she is here just to say thank you for accepting her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| If you accept her, without objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| if you would allow her to say that in my three minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| Yes, she may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| For some of you I will be developing new relationships with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| and for others I've already had existing relationships with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| I know I've had an opportunity to be chair since 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| and to work on the Professional Educators Collaborative Conferencing Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| with Mr. Thomas, and also Mr. Bolton and Mr. McPherson here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| and newly Dr. Reiswig as well as Ms. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| So I'm looking forward to continuing our relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| as well as establishing new relationships with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| So thank you so much for accepting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| And that concludes my mouth running at this board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| On behalf of the board, I'd like to say, Ms. Coates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| it's been great to work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| and I look forward to seeing you in the future in whatever new role you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| and I look forward to getting to know Ms. Hancock better and working with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Okay, and we'll move to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Mr. Jin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| I guess I can say some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| I feel like I kind of mentioned this when I was at one of the previous work sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| but I look forward to working with all the members of this board for this next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| and hopefully everything goes well and get some things done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| You made it through your first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| All right, and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210630?start=4597)|
