| 0:05:30| The audit process, well, first of all, it covers the period of July 1st, 2021 through June 30th of 2022, so last school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=330)|
| 0:05:41| And the process started back in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| In May, our team would go to each individual high school and test transactions at each individual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| And then the remaining schools were tested by records being brought into the UT Tower, East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| And we had a war room in there and basically spent June and July there doing that testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| As bookkeepers came back, we had follow-up questions in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| And after that, we were drafting this short report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| With, I guess, a few other notes, this is, you know, we are required to test a bunch of transactions for all types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=378)|
| 0:06:31| And in the nature of internal school funds or just the school accounts, there's only so many controls, so it's common to have exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=391)|
| 0:06:41| We try to evaluate whether exceptions are going up or down and which areas are going up and down and try and assess from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| But we did go over our findings with management, first with Jennifer and also Ron McPherson and Garrett Radin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=409)|
| 0:06:58| And then we also had a follow-up meeting with the superintendent and the assistant superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| So this, I think, is important for the board to realize that this report received a lot of attention from school management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| With that said, we'll actually go through parts of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| On the screen you have, it's Roman numeral page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| I'm not sure if it's PDF page 6 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| But this is the start of the audit report, PDF page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| This is the start of the audit report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| It's approximately three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| If you've seen other audit reports, it's worded kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| It's worded funny only because we're under a report example by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| This report is not in accordance with GAAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| It's not supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Instead, it's in accordance with the state manual, the Tennessee Internal School Uniform Accounting Policy Manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=473)|
| 0:08:01| And so if you read it carefully and it seems unusual, keep in mind this is the standard report for an internal school fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| So it is the report you should see from an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| It's not a modified report that there are issues with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| So it is your standard report for an internal school fund audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| Let's go ahead and skip to page 1 on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| It's about page 9, correct, on the PDF pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| And these four pages, basically PDF page 9 through 12 or report pages 1 through 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| is a summary of the first two pages are the balance sheet and the second two pages are the income statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| And a few key numbers from here is that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| your cash between all the checking accounts held at these schools is roughly $13.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=537)|
| 0:09:11| That is up from $12 million the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| And that would be at the bottom of page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Now, what I'd like to also look at are the total revenues, or basically receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| and disbursements that would be on the bottom of page 4 or PDF page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| So keep in mind transactions here are typically small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| You typically have small transactions to the school checking account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Larger ones would go through the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| But total revenues for the year were over $20 million, $20.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| Total disbursements expenditures were $18.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| So that's a lot of small transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| And as we compare findings for this year to last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| I think one important thing to realize is FY22 had a whole lot more activity than FY21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| because FY21 we were still dealing with COVID to a higher extent than we were in FY22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| Because like the $20 million in revenue this year is compared to $13 million in fiscal year 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| But $20 million is pretty much the norm for regular operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| So activity was back closer to where we expected it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| That's the financial side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Let's go ahead and skip forward to the findings section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| And that's way – I'll wait until it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| It's on report page 384.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| But it's – the PDF page is beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Yes, PDF page 395 if you're following it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| And this is the start of the findings section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| There are 12 findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| There were 11 findings a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| We'll go over that summary shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| But one finding went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| There are two new findings this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| As far as number of instances, number of instances were about the same for FY22 compared to FY21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| maybe probably down just a few, but pretty similar to a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| I guess the good news from that perspective is that transactions are up, you know, 50% over the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| And there were areas that did improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Let's go ahead and jump to the next spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| If you're looking at 395 while the cursor moves, you'll notice there's a criteria condition, cause and effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| recommendation and management response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| So if you're reading any of these findings, the condition is predominantly the finding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| and the management response is basically management's response, what they plan to do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| But this page right here is kind of a summary of most of the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| It's where we list the prior year findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| And the first ten of them are repeat findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=742)|
| 0:12:32| The last finding, number 11 on graduating class accounts, went away, was resolved, corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| but there were two new findings, which are in the report as finding number 11 and finding number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| While the majority of these are repeated, and it's fine to stay on that page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=766)|
| 0:12:54| while the majority of these are repeated, one thing that's important to note is that for a finding to go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| it means that all 90 schools pretty much have to be in compliance with the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| And some of these would be near impossible to be completely in compliance with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| For instance, segregation of duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| The only way to resolve that would be to hire a couple more people at each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| or hire a significant number of personnel in central office to be able to handle segregating different responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=803)|
| 0:13:31| for collecting and dispersing monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| So there's a give and take there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Findings number three, four, and five on there, disbursements, receipts, purchase orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| Actually, the findings in these three areas went down for this year compared to last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| With the increase in activity, that's a really good accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| So there have been processes in place to where these three finding areas are improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=833)|
| 0:14:01| A new finding this year are there were certain funds that were receded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| were not receded, excuse me, that were finding number 11 for this year that were not receded in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=847)|
| 0:14:16| So basically collected and not put directly into the school's bank account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| and that's something we're going to be working on this year, and I know there's new procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| But keep in mind, you have teachers collecting money, you have school support organizations collecting money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| and sometimes the money needs to go directly into the school account instead of to an SSO or to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| the ease of making payments, you could pay a teacher with a Venmo account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| but really can't do that to have the proper segregation of duties in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| So overall, some improvements, some areas that digressed a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=892)|
| 0:15:01| but I'd say pretty similar results except for the fact there's a lot more activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| So that aspect I would consider encouraging that the findings did not go up with activity increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| I know you haven't had this report very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| I'm more than welcome to answer any questions that you have on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| I'm also more than welcome to come back Thursday night if you want to have any questions there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| or catch me before the meeting or anything of that nature for any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| but I'll be glad to come back Thursday if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| But if you have any questions now, I'll be glad to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Does anyone have any questions on this report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| I guess one last note is I do want to call and appreciate the support that we get from Garrett's staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| and also from Ron and Jennifer during the course of our audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| There's a lot of cooperation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| There was a lot of oversight and also involvement by management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| so I consider that a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=979)|
| 0:16:37| Going into the discussion of our January 12th, 2023 regular agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| just to note that we will be meeting on Thursday this week and not Wednesday since our new schedule changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| so just a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| As communicated via email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| items have been added to our January 12th regular session agenda for projects at Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| and Sequoia Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| These items were unable to be confirmed prior to the holidays but are time sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| so Superintendent Ryswek and I agreed on their addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Also, I wanted to let you know the attachments on 9C and 10G were updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| 9C is consideration of contracts for student telehealth services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| and the date terms of the contracts had to be updated due to the use of federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| 10G is consideration of our teacher tenure list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| and a couple of teachers needed to have their school location updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| We can entertain questions on those items as we review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| So moving into the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1058)|
| 0:17:49| Consent agenda 6A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| C, items and contracts 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1077)|
| 0:18:07| 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| 5 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| 7 or 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| I have some questions on 7, the new leaf speaker management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| Who can answer those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| Dr. Wilson, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| It looks like this was originally a building level in-service day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| Do we know how much time teachers are going to be away from their building to interact with this speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1126)|
| 0:18:59| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1139)|
| 0:19:09| When I looked, I thought it said the whole day was building-wide, but that may just be a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1149)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| And did teachers have input into this choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1164)|
| 0:19:32| Dr. Wilson, can you speak into your mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| The schools that are listed there in Region 1 have come together to pool their money for this speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| I can't speak to the teacher input as far as those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| So it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| It would be a school level whether there was teacher input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Dr. Wilson, so it's only Region 1, and you said they pooled monies to be able to bring this particular person in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1195)|
| 0:20:04| So if you look at the fiscal note, West High is covering the cost of it, but to be reimbursed through the PD funds that are available to the other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| And I said Region 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| It was lifted up by Danny Tran, as those schools are representative in that region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| So any other questions on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Item 8 or Item 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1225)|
| 0:20:34| Moving into Board Policy 7A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| Or Item E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| I know that we brought up the discussion of the public charter school policy at our meetings in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| And we talked about wanting to discuss those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| I think I was expecting that they would be brought up at our policy review meeting on Friday, but there's already recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| So can we speak to what's driving the recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| Julie Thompson and I had a discussion about this particular policy and the fact that we are about to embark on charter review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1278)|
| 0:21:28| charter application review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Matter of fact, we had some training today on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| So the need, I felt the need, frankly, to get this before the board sooner as opposed to later, and she did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| So the changes that you see are aligned with the current law, which is different from when this policy was first promulgated back when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1301)|
| 0:21:52| probably roughly 10 years ago when Emerald came on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Just a quick note on page 3, line 41, there is a typo there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| It should say charter school instead of chart school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| But that can be caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| A lot of the conversation that we had at our meeting in December was based on what feedback is the board really giving to the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1329)|
| 0:22:19| related to the makeup of the review team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| And we had talked about how up until now the board really hasn't spoken into that or has not been intentional about speaking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| So I think even if we end up modifying the policy to be able to make it correct more directly to the law, which it needs to, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1351)|
| 0:22:41| I think it also would be good for the board to be able to have a more in-depth conversation about the makeup of that team for future evaluation committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1361)|
| 0:22:55| And also notice that there is a recommended change to that section on page 2, lines 18 through 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| And what it does is it basically makes the three community group folks, parent representative, community partner, and other community representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1383)|
| 0:23:14| as not required, where it seemed like there was a lot of conversation in our meeting in December about how those are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| And it was expressed by some board members that even the particular folks who make up those is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| So I'm assuming that, I'm wondering what drove that asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Is that because it's not required in law to have those or, I don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| So whatever you see before you as far as the changes are strictly what the law requires to make it current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1418)|
| 0:23:48| But you're right, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I mean, you know, will this board, I mean, if this board wants to make changes, you know, from here on out, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| But again, we felt like that certainly the policy needed to reflect the correct law with us about to embark upon this application review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1437)|
| 0:24:06| In the future, the board's free to make whatever policy and reemphasize certain areas or whatever the board feels needs necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| So in line eight there on that second page where it says the committee is now saying reading may consist where it said shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| that's to clarify that the law actually does not require those particular departments to be represented currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| I have a question just about timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Is the committee, would it be set prior to receiving the applications anyway so that, and the reason for my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1480)|
| 0:24:51| therefore a specific community member as far as a community area wouldn't necessarily come into play or is that not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1491)|
| 0:25:00| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| As far as timing, the timeline, if we approve the committee, that's typically ahead of receiving any applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1501)|
| 0:25:12| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| So therefore we wouldn't, if we appointed a parent to that committee, the parent would be from any district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1514)|
| 0:25:23| and not necessarily an area where a school could be proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| You know, and Ms. Horne, I know that that was part of the discussion at the board's last meeting was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| should the parent come from, you know, the particular district that's impacted or region that's impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| Again, that's something that the board can certainly mull over and decide which way you want to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| I mean, you know, the committee's already picked, or the board's already approved the committee for this particular cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| So that, the change to this policy really, I mean, that particular portion would affect the next cycle, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1554)|
| 0:26:05| because the committee's already chosen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| So you'd almost have to make a motion to add someone to the committee if you had, as a parent representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| let's say we had, somebody was proposing one in District, you know, 4, but we didn't have a parent on there from District 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1575)|
| 0:26:23| but we wanted one, you'd have to add that person after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| For this cycle, yes, yes, the board would have to make a specific motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Just to clarify, we wouldn't have the applications when the committee was formed, but we would have letters of intent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1595)|
| 0:26:45| Yeah, that's, not necessarily, I mean, it just depends upon when the board, you know, approves the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1605)|
| 0:26:55| I mean, you know, again, I think the practice in the past has been when there's some letters of intent that may be expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1615)|
| 0:27:08| or applications expected, then a committee's formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| But, you know, the board could approve a committee for each year if it wanted to at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| So it's not, I mean, the law simply requires that the committee be in place before the applications are reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1640)|
| 0:27:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| So, Mr. Dupler, the bullet points G through I, where they're asterisked right now, and it says, but it's not required, that's according to law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1656)|
| 0:27:47| But the board could choose to make the policy say they are required, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| I think based upon the conversation that we had last month, I would recommend that even for this version of the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| that we don't change that, and we leave those as is for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| And if we want to, at some point, say we don't want those groups represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| But then also I think there's some clarification in the wording that's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| because the sentence that precludes the bullet point list in rows eight and nine says individuals from the following KCS departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| where those last three bullet points are actually not KCS departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| So those should probably be broken into two separate lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| And I think what you could do then is say the committee may consist of the individuals from these KCS departments, these six or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| and then I would make a second list that then has those three bullet points and say the committee shall consist of individuals from those groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| only based on the conversation that we were having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| But again, I thought this was going to be discussed at the policy review meeting on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| So I'm making, or not Friday, this Friday, but later in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| So anyway, I think we're, it seems like what's happening in this, even though we're trying to make it represent the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| actually goes against a lot of the conversation that we had in December, is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1740)|
| 0:29:12| All right, so any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Okay, so moving on to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Item 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| Items B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1765)|
| 0:29:32| Items D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| Items F or G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| H or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| J or K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| So moving on to contracts, items 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| Item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| So I know that this is probably being driven by the fact that we have the same agenda order every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| where contracts are ahead of regular agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| but it would seem a little bit odd that we would be asked to vote for the contract for the design of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| prior to voting for the purchase agreement for the land, in terms of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| So it would seem that we just need to reorganize the agenda on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| So we can pull that one out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| That is noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| Item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| I have quite a few questions, so I may ask some of them and then let some other people ask some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| In the terms of the contract, it says that part of this contract is also the original Marival contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| but I don't see that in the attachments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| Can we get a copy of that at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1876)|
| 0:31:26| Is that available somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| You can absolutely get a copy of the Marival contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| The other piece that I'm looking at, what it says is that we are approving the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| but what we have here, we have a contract and then we have, let me see how it's worded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1900)|
| 0:31:52| a service agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| So to me it looks like we have two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| One is a contract and one is a service agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| In the contract, the language says that the contract is between Knox County Government and Duncan & Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1919)|
| 0:32:09| In the service agreement, it says that it's between Knox County Schools and Duncan & Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| And Mr. Dupler has tried to get rid of my concerns here, but I still have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| I am concerned that throughout the contract, it says that it is with Knox County Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| It doesn't say that it's with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| and I don't feel that I have the authority to vote on something that is in Knox County Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| and not Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| So that's greatly concerning to me, that it doesn't say in the contract that it's specifically a contract with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1960)|
| 0:32:49| I understand that it's because this is coming through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| However, if our item says that we are voting on the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and the contract says that it's between Knox County Government and the vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| then I don't feel that's in our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| So that's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| I have other contract questions, but I'm not going to look at those right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| My larger concern is that I feel like we have put ourselves in the position of not having custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=1994)|
| 0:33:23| and it's a many-year process that it's happened over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| In the 90s, we had some outsourcing, and then over time in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| we reduced the number of custodians over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| So what we have is no capacity for when someone is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| There is no slack where someone could pick it up because everyone is already stretched ridiculously thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| So if you're missing a person, then they're already stretched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| Someone's out for any reason, whether it's sickness or because the position isn't filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| and we just don't have enough positions in our schools to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| That's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| However, when I go out and look for a custodial position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| what I find listed is one position in Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and it's listed as being with the maintenance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| If I'm a person who lives out west and I'm looking for a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| then I'm not planning to travel all the way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| I'm looking for something that's closer to my zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| If I do a search, let's say that I say I'm living in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| and I do a search by that zip code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I'm not going to find any custodial positions open in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| because they're not listed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And so that's part of the problem is that our advertising doesn't match what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| Also, if we go and look at our position openings listed with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| and we go to our website and look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| positions that we have multiple positions for, they're listed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| If we need 20 TAs, it says we need 20 TAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| But under custodian, it says one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| So if I'm a custodian looking for a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| and I think there's only one in Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| I'm not sure I'm going to apply for that because my chance isn't necessarily that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2122)|
| 0:35:32| The other thing that I see is when I go in to apply for that job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| the application is extensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| It's 12 sections of an application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And I'll bring you guys some screenshots of what that process actually looks like next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| It is lengthy, and it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| And even though this is a separate application from that for certified staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| still, it's unwieldy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| If you look at it, going through 12 sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| there's a point where somebody is just going to go, no thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| But the greater problem is that when I go and I look and I search custodial positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| nobody is paying $10.08 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Nobody anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| I couldn't find any custodial positions even close to that lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| The lowest rate I could find was $11 an hour, and that's not usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| Generally, what I find is $13 and up as a bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| They're starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| So we can go to any other company and look for a custodial position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| and their starting salary is $2 more than in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| That alone, why would you look in Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| when we're not paying a competitive salary at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Every time we've looked at hiring administrative positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| we've talked about the necessity of paying a reasonable wage to get someone qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| But when we talk about our custodial positions, what I hear is, oh, we can't afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| Baloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| If we want to do that, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| So looking at the amount of money that we have, we have 382 custodial positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| and if they're working 255 days at eight hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| we could give each of them a dollar raise for $779,000, far less than this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2252)|
| 0:37:41| If we have 382 custodians at 255 days, eight hours per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| we could still come in under the cost of this contract if we paid them $1.33 more per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| All year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| That's for all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| This contract is for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Looking at the custodians we actually have from what we got last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| 301 positions are filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| 81 are unfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| If we took the money that we have looking out for this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| we could give all of our 301 custodians a $1,500 bonus per semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| and have a $1,500 signing bonus for 81 more positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| to attract people to come in and take those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| Looking at giving this to another company doesn't make sense to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| when we could be taking care of this ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| It doesn't make sense to me that we assume another company can go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| and hire these positions when we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| They can go hire these positions because they're paying them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| If we were paying them more, we wouldn't have to be looking at this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Mr. Dupler, would you like to speak to that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I know the law department reviewed these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| when we discussed in the agenda set meeting, but just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| Yes, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Yes, I can speak to the contract concern, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| What the board sees before it is basically a standard form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| that comes from Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| They do use the term Knox County Government as a generic term, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| What that means is that any division of Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| which would include the Board of Education, can use this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| That's why they use that type of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| It's up front because it is the main contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Whenever you have a contract and it includes numerous documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| all the documents are part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| So there is a service agreement, as Ms. Owen talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| that came from Duncan & Sons, but that's what I would call it's of lower priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| I mean, it's part of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| but the top priority is the contract language from procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| which best protects the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| So the contract itself is in proper form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| and does a good job of protecting both the board and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| When the board votes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| obviously the board is only saying that it's conferring its approval or disapproval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| and then commission would then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| okay, well, there's money in the budget or there's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| and that's all the commission would say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| As far as needing the marital contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| I appreciate Dr. Adams saying that he'll provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| because that is part of the contract because it's what we call a piggyback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| So, I mean, that would set the term, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| is what the five months that Ms. Owen talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| So that's it from the legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| So the law department doesn't have any concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| No, not from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Actually, I wanted to see if Dr. Adams would speak first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| to some of the concerns that Ms. Owen has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Ms. Owen, I appreciate your sentiments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| and I agree with you 100% that our custodians do need to be appropriately compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| I do want to clarify a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Currently, they start at a 1089.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| So we did look at a raise, what it would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and, of course, we would start with the beginning salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| and we would look at the trickle-down effect to our veteran custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| and it was to the tune of about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| I also wanted to address the why, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| and basically the why is our custodians are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| When we met with every one of our custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| I had some in-depth conversation, and they basically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| Dr. Adams, we are struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| We need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| So this is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| This is to get our custodians help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Currently, we have 392 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| We have 83 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Keep in mind, we started the school year with 89 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| We dropped down to 79 vacancies, and we're already right back up to 83 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| We have several custodians, and if Ms. Hall would like to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| we have several custodians who have recently retired because they're exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| A lot of our custodians would use overtime for supplemental income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and they simply don't want it anymore because they are exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| The custodians we spoke to, and I had one-on-one conversations when I met with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| they are very appreciative of this opportunity because it helps them get through the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| and I can't imagine cleaning a building to exhaustion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| and you come back to the same building the next day, and you're right back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| So they certainly understand and appreciate the fact that they are going to get help to finish out this school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| as we figure out how we compensate our custodians and do a better job of recruitment and retainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| I will say this, the conversation I did have with our custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| yes, you do have contractors and local businesses that pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| However, our veteran custodians have expressed that the benefits that Knox County Schools provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| there's nothing even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| If you even look at the 12% increase for some of our custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| they're here for the benefits as far as the retirement benefits and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| Now, if we can do the compensation as well, I'm 100% on board with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| but the understanding is a lot of these contractors, they will pay our custodians $2 more an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| and then before you know it, they're dismissed from their duties because they fill a contract and they move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| So those are the conversations that I had with our custodians, the one-on-one conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| and they did echo that even though they are appreciative of the benefits, of course they would like more compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| So it's more complex than just pay our custodians more, which once again I'm all in favor for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| but a lot of our custodians, when you look at the competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| a lot of our custodians are looking at those benefits and they are appreciative of Knox County Schools' benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| Currently, our biggest problem is hiring and retaining our custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| and so having a staff of only 83 vacancies, I know that sounds significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2680)|
| 0:44:47| but when you look at the number of employees we have that are custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| we have a healthy group that we just right now need to provide them some support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| And I'm not looking at this as being a long-term solution by any stretch of the imagination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| but I truly believe that we need to support our custodians and give them the help they need to finish up the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| Thank you. Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Dr. Adams, and I do appreciate you reaching out to custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| I know that you also have been in different buildings and talking to principals and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| and the reality is the challenge that we have right now does not just affect our custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| it also affects our end users in terms of our students and our faculty and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| and so I think there is a challenge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I also agree with Ms. Owen that this challenge has been created over many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| and it's also been created over big market shifts just nationally over the last couple of years with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, there's people that are making money in retail that would have never thought they would have made that money in retail right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| I do think there's a narrative that's going around that I think it's important to correct with the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| and that is they see the number of $24 an hour in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| and there's the perception that the custodians with Duncan and Sons are going to be making $24 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| and that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| You have to take off profit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| You have to take off whatever benefit percentage they take out of that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| any potential retirement or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| so I don't know that we know exactly what those custodians will make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| but it's certainly less than $24 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| and I think it's also important then to make sure that we're thinking about what we add back in in terms of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| so the number that keeps going around in emails is we pay $10.89 an hour per custodian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| which is the starting rate, base rate, but when you add back in benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| even at that base rate, they're making $15.83 when you add back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| and I appreciate Scott running some numbers for me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| When you add back in the benefits, that's more where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| so I think it's pretty hard for us as a board or even the general public to make an apples-to-apples comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| between what Duncan and Sons folks might be getting versus what our folks are getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| and I think it's also important what you articulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| that there are people who value benefits over compensation versus time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| There's a lot of things that go into making those decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| but I do think, and I agree with Ms. Owen and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| that we do need to figure out how to make a significant bump in what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| and I also know that then trickles down to other categories of employee that we have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| There's not just a challenge with our custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| That's who we're talking about tonight, but that challenge goes into other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| so I would hope that when we see a budget proposal coming up for the school year that we'll see some work done on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| and if you want to speak any more now to what kind of steps is your department taking to help address the long-term problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| I think it's great to put some of that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I'd like to speak to that at this point because that was part of my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2873)|
| 0:48:02| Dr. Adams, did you have something you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Yes, I just wanted to add one other thing to Ms. Owen's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| and her concerns are very valid, and we looked at a lot of the things she had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| We did look at, before I took this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| Knox County Schools did list positions for custodians by school, and it didn't fare well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| What I do know, Ms. Hall has done an exceptional job of getting people in and then selling people on schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| Because when we narrow it down to particular areas, we lose custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| and so getting them in the building and then providing them with alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| such as transportation or multiple schools, we found that to be very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| I will say Brett Foster has piloted the bilocation with food services, and it has not been successful this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| and so she's looking to go back to more of a general posting and get people in and have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| The other piece to that is we do have people who come on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and Ms. Hall and her team work directly with those applicants to ensure that they can apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| and help them with the online process to ensure that they have the help that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Well, my concerns have already been somewhat addressed or spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| One would be having temp workers, if you will, coming in and making more than those who are your regular custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2968)|
| 0:49:42| and I understand that with the benefits package, and if you add all that together, then it may balance itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2982)|
| 0:49:52| But that is a concern when I look and see that you're going to, not just that you're paying the company $24,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| I mean $24 an hour, but that the workers who come in working side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| the temp workers generally you don't expect for them to make more than those who are already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| those who are the veterans of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And the second thing is that I'd like to hear what is the long-range solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| What's the end game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| How do we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| I know I'm hearing we didn't get here overnight, so we may not be out of it in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| but we still should be making some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| So what is that long-term plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| And what kind of thoughts do we have in terms of plans we have in terms of moving us away from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| One of those would be, I'm sure, raising the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| Dr. Reiswig, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Dr. Adams, I'll let you jump in for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| I just want to say a couple things to this and to answer your question, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| I want to say again, because I think it needs to be said, we're committed to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| We're committed to our custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| And as part of the family, we said a lot of that last month, but a lot has happened since last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| I just want everybody to understand that that's our ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| While this temporary contract, if you all choose to vote it in, is in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| we still will be continuing to hire full-time custodians who want to come work for us and encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| I think we're in a tough place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| I will say this, too, the same thing that has been said multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| This board, over the last two years, has done a 16% increase in custodian salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| and I think our plan will be, again, I'll leave that to Ron and the guys who crunched the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| but to bring you guys something for this upcoming budget that continues to work on that compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| But I want to answer your question honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| We don't know that we have the solution, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| We don't know that it's just this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| I definitely think increasing salaries, I mean, that seems to be what we do in education across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| and thinking that that's always going to work, but it doesn't always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| So what I know as a superintendent that the challenge that we have in a lot of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| and I can think of some of them from up to a year to 18 months ago, that we're begging for help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| those principals calling us and asking us what else can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| So we're at this current place having to weigh how do we get school, as Mr. Watson said, clean for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| and students when teachers shouldn't be emptying trash cans and cleaning tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| and doing those kinds of things on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Everybody jumps in and pitches in when they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| We get that, but that's not, you know, we need them teaching students and being focused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| So I think this is one way for us to look at that, to hope that this is, as Dr. Adams said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| to provide some relief for our current custodians and try to help with that load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| I hope that part of the answer is increased compensation for these positions, but I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3172)|
| 0:53:00| I mean, we see the same signs when we drive through our neighborhoods at Starbucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| and Target are hiring for $16 an hour, and I assume if those signs are there, they have vacancies, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| So I don't know what that magic number is or what that thing looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| We'll continue to try those, and I think what you see in this contract is our attempt to keep schools clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| with another effort, but ultimately we want it to be Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| and so we hope it's a temporary fix, but we'll continue to try because we have that obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| for teachers and for students to keep schools clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| So, again, we hope that this helps in the immediate, that we can get schools back to where they need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| and hopefully, again, compensation and things work for the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| Dr. Adams, I don't know if you were going to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| I'll probably jump to the front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| I was going to ask Ms. Hall, she can provide you all with some additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| or if there are any additional questions you all have, she can certainly give you some history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| and definitely where we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3236)|
| 0:54:07| I'm here for any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I'll try to give you the best answer that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| We struggled for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| I've been here in this position for about 10 years, and when I first came, we had almost a full staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3257)|
| 0:54:27| We had about 375 custodians, and looking back on those days, I wouldn't have longed for those days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3267)|
| 0:54:36| because we've had so many openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| We have done everything that I can possibly think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| We've done some crazy ideas, trying to get people to apply, trying to get people to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| trying to get people to schools, and you are right, completely right, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| I feel like long term, we probably need to look at trying to increase our custodial pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| but that is not where we are right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Where we are right at the moment is we have lots of tired, worn out, I would say, custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| and we're not making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| We're continuing to lose ground every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| I'm surprised, honestly, that we've made it halfway through the school year to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| and not in worse shape than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| In talking with the principals of the 17 schools that we've proposed, it was 110% positive feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3329)|
| 0:55:39| very few questions, I don't remember, Dr. Adams, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| but I don't remember a single concern from any of those principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| They welcome the help, not just to have clean buildings, but to help those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| that are in those schools right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| I'll use Hardin Valley Academy as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| We have eight positions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| We need eight people there to keep that building to our KCS cleaning standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| It takes eight people running on all cylinders to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| We have three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| We have had three people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| It's the same three people there for this entire school year, through the summer even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| Now, we pull from different schools and various places with our Dream Teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| and Rob and Peter to pay Paul, so to speak, with some of our other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| but long term, it's just not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| We've been talking about this since school started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| We offered a sign-on bonus through the school year last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| I would have to get with compensation to get the exact numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| but I'm guessing we hired about 60 people that we gave a sign-on bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| We gave that bonus to them in two payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| After their first 30 days, we gave them the first half of the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| After their 90 days, we gave them the second half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| I would guess, and I think I'm going to make a pretty good guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| that half of those didn't make it the 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| or we ended up taking most of them back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| because they didn't fulfill the requirements to keep the sign-on bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| We elected not to do that this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| because compensation was just overwhelmed with the accounting of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| I'm trying to think what else we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| For the last two years, we've been very diligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| about when we speak with our applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| finding out if they have verifiable cleaning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| If they do, we have submitted that through Dr. Adams to HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| to get that approved to give them up to five years' experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Right now, if a custodian comes in and they have at least five years' experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| we send a memo and start that custodian out on step five versus step zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| That has helped retain some of our more experienced applicants that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| but the bottom line is we don't have an applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| For these 17 schools, there's a couple of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| that we're just struggling with right now for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| but most of them are struggling because we don't have applicants that live in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| and that can afford transportation to Farragut, Hardin Valley, Bearden Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| some of those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you, Ms. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| I will piggyback on what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I've only heard from the administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| I've heard from parents and teachers at some of these schools that are really impacted by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| and they're desperate for immediate because they are tired and exhausted and need help now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3547)|
| 0:59:20| It looks like, Ms. Spike, you were next and then Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| I'm curious to piggyback off of Ms. Owens talking about the 12-page application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| and just what has been done to make that application process a little bit easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| what you've tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| Anytime someone reaches out via email, phone call, text message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| or even through a current employee, we encourage that applicant to come to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| We have a computer set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| We always have someone there during our normal office hours to sit down either with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| help get them online and get that process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| We help them to whatever extent they need help to get that completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| Is anything like that listed in kind of like the job posting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Because I could definitely say, I mean, even for myself and applying for a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| if it's pages and pages and pages, it's going to be discouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| And knowing that I could just email and maybe have someone help me through it, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| It's not current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| To my knowledge, it's not currently part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3633)|
| 1:00:40| Ms. Himelgaard, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Ms. Spike, that's not something that's currently in the posting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| but we can explore opportunities to add information like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| And then you talked about that there just isn't an applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Was it the same last year, or is the pool even lower this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| I just want to specify, I believe what Ms. Hall is referring to is an applicant pool in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| And historically, there has always been a struggle in those areas as far as the applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Just a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| I don't disagree with much of anything, if anything, that's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3690)|
| 1:01:38| But if you raise, and I think I've been a supportive of custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3698)|
| 1:01:46| You all have not been here, but in the time I've been here, I've been as supportive as most anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3706)|
| 1:01:54| Because back probably 12 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3714)|
| 1:02:06| the then superintendent was going to contract out and had the votes to do it until the present city mayor and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3726)|
| 1:02:20| And I don't say this to toot my own horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| I just say it for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| But that puts a stop to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And I still run into people occasionally that thank me for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| So they do remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| But I'll support raising whatever you can raise, an hour, I mean a dollar an hour, two dollars, three, whatever, within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3758)|
| 1:02:52| But I think that it's more the federal government today has conditioned people where they can get by without working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3772)|
| 1:03:10| They get money somehow or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| And I would dare say that if you offered an increase of two dollars an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3795)|
| 1:03:27| you probably wouldn't have more than 20% increase if you had that many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| Because they just, you know, the ones that are, I guess what I'm trying to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| the ones that are working do a good job when they see they kind of get in a rhythm after a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3821)|
| 1:03:52| and they're comfortable working for Knox County with the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| This is just my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| And it is a better, less pressure place to work than a lot of other places are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3841)|
| 1:04:12| So they stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| But some of these people that you hire, you know, they probably wouldn't, as my grandmother used to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3855)|
| 1:04:25| they probably wouldn't work the pie factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| But they just, it is a problem and it's been a problem for a good number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3868)|
| 1:04:39| So I don't know what, as far as providing rides and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3879)|
| 1:04:48| but it makes a little sense if somebody lives downtown or in the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| and they would have to drive to Farragut or Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| they'd run out the gas for at least half of what they earned for going down there for four hours or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3900)|
| 1:05:10| So I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| It is just a temporary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| And hopefully the situation will get better when some of these people see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3917)|
| 1:05:27| and they feel more comfortable working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| Because like I say, from what I've seen, they tend to get in a groove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| and want to stay or else they move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| And I think, Ms. Horne, you were next and then Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| But before that, I would just like to remind everyone in attendance tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| that if you need to speak to the person beside you, please step outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| We certainly don't want to ask anyone to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| but it is very distracting when we can hear noise from the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| and we're trying to hear other board members speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| First, thank you, Ms. Holfer, for supporting our custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| I can only imagine how difficult your job is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| and I appreciate your support of them and how hard they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| And I know many of our custodians are long-time employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| and I appreciate Dr. Adams speaking with many of them also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| This issue has been, well, and to the point about salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| I've asked a couple of times about the salary review that the district is conducting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| because I definitely think that we need to look at the overall salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| not only of this but also of nutrition and bookkeeping and several of the area's TAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| So I'm interested to see that, and also when we get to the budget cycle, what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| I'm leery of doing anything outside of that budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| because I think we need to look at the big picture and look at everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| This issue has been a primary issue in my schools for well over a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| So out of my five schools, four of my schools are significantly impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| which Ms. Hall knows very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| and I appreciate that you've tried to get people there if they're willing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| So thank you for all of that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| So my principals just, they need their schools to be cleaned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| and the custodians that we have there are, as has already been said, are overworked and they need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| So I appreciate the district looking for some way to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| This contract is, I don't remember what the start date is, but through June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| So this is certainly not a long-term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| It's for a handful of months to fix an issue that has a problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| I don't have a lot of confidence that if we raise the salary right now that we would get applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| because of what Dr. Reiswick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| There are help wanted signs everywhere you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| and I appreciate Mr. Watson bringing up the benefits and Dr. Adams' explanation about the benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| because I think that does help us get an overall picture that, I don't know what the breakdown is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| but that there are a lot more people who are making more than $10 an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| and when you factor in the benefits, it's significantly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| So my schools need help. That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| The schools, there's no way that at Farragut High School that three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| it's either two or three janitors can clean the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| It's just not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| So we have massive amounts of people in these buildings every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| That's a lot of people to clean up after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| So we need help in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| And so I wish we had done this last month because my schools need help today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| So I will be voting for this, and I'm thankful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| I just want to say, again, I do appreciate, echo what Mrs. Horn said about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| appreciate your support of our custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| If you have been in business in any way involved in the recruitment, hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| and retention of employees in the last couple of years, that's been a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| specifically some entry-level positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| and you are looking for any avenue you can to find employees, find an applicant pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| to draw from, and you've got hardworking employees who are doing the very best they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| that are exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| And so I applaud you finding a solution, and certainly we'll be voting for it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| giving some relief to our current custodians and kind of a stopgap measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| I agree, you know, salary and benefits, and there may be some things we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| We get to do that in the budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| and we can look through that big picture and see if there is a way we can make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| which I think everyone would love to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| But I just appreciate you all finding a solution to support the custodians that need the help right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Ms. Henderson, I don't think we've heard from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| I couldn't agree more with Ms. Horn and Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| I completely agree with everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| And thank you, Ms. Hall, for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I know it has not been an easy road, so know that you are appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| And Dr. Adams, thank you so much for going to those schools, talking to the custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| I have several schools that are greatly impacted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I get pictures from teachers of the conditions in the school right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4220)|
| 1:10:25| and it's affecting our custodians, but it's also affecting our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| Our teachers are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| They're having to clean these rooms when they should be educating our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| And our teachers are asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| And so I appreciate you guys thinking outside of the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| and getting the teachers, custodians, and our kids the help that they need now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| So I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| This first thing that I'm going to say doesn't help us at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| but I want to put it out there because I think it's important for the board to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| It just makes me mad, and I think you need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| The year before last, we had a couple of elected officials, some parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| and some former students who were we keep talking about begging for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| They were begging to volunteer in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| They wanted to form groups to go into our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| and help our custodians after hours with the minor things that they could help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| so custodians could do the main part of their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| And our person who was in operations at the time refused that offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4295)|
| 1:11:43| because he said that the background checks would be too difficult and overwhelming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| even though we have a system in place for volunteers to come into our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| for all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| That was the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| We, Knox County Schools, decided that instead of having some elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| and some parents organize people to come and help for nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| we would rather say no than do the background checks necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| So that's just something that's been on my mind for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| Nothing we can do about that at this point, but I just wanted you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| So we keep talking about the inability to find workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| but we expect Duncan and Sons to go hire 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| If they can hire 50 right now, we should be able to hire 50 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4354)|
| 1:12:40| It doesn't make sense to me that we can contract with a company who can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| but we can't do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| However, it does make sense to me when I look at the advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| If you'll go and search for a custodial job, go and find what Duncan and Sons has listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| Go and find what we have listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| First off, we have $10.08 listed as our bottom salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| If we're paying $10.89, it needs to say $10.89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| It shouldn't say $10.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| When I look at the advertising for Duncan and Sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| it lists the benefits of coming to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| Hey, come work for us. It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| When I look at ours, it's basically a list of these horrible things you're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| Here are your job responsibilities, by golly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| and it's not something that makes you really want to jump up and apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4408)|
| 1:13:39| We've talked about all these options that we're providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| and I appreciate that we're looking for ways to help people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| but we're doing it after they apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| We need to be bringing in the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| So these are things that if people knew on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| maybe we would have more applicants so that we could offer these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Being able to offer them transportation, being able to offer different buildings, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| but if they don't know that before they come to us, then we may never see them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| Back to our background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Will Duncan and Sons use the same background checks we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| or are they only the background checks listed in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| They will use the exact same background checks that is in accordance with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| And my last question that I'm going to ask tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| it seems to me to be a conflict between the service agreement and the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| and if you look at item 19 in the contract and item 3 in the service agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| item 19, basically it's talking about problems, if we have problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| if we need to terminate the contract, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Item 19 says we shall endeavor to rectify the problem within 72 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| and if the same problems or other problems persist or recur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| the county may terminate the contract on 30 calendar days written notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| So that's in 19 in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| But when we look at the service agreement under termination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| it says if a contractor shall fail to substantially correct the deficiencies within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4513)|
| 1:15:22| then we have another 30 days to terminate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| So in one, it's looking at 72 hours to correct the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| In the other, it's looking at 30 days to correct the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| So I think we need to find some kind of agreement in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| Mr. Dupont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Ms. Owen, item 19 in the main contract takes precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| so any conflict in the service agreement would be overruled by the main language in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4548)|
| 1:15:57| So it would be 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Thank you, Mr. Dupont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| Ms. Owen, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Just one question and two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Ms. Hall, thank you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| I appreciate you being here and speaking on behalf of our custodians and all the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| I know it's not a job that I would want, especially in those conditions of being just outgunned, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| There's just not nearly enough people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Dr. Adams, how confident are we that Duckins and Sons can fulfill the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| Do they need to hire 50 new employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Do they have a base to start with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| I mean, what's our confidence level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Correct me if I'm wrong, Ms. Hall, but they have a base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| They have assured us that they will be able to have employees on February 1st if the proposed contract is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| and they will be ready to start and go and have all schools serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| So in terms of the total number needed based on the contract, they would be able to start with that number on the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| That's what they've guaranteed us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| So then my guess is, I mean, I don't know how important this is, but they're probably not going out and hiring 50 new people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| They're probably fulfilling this with some of their current personnel, from your understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| From my understanding, yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| I have two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| One is, I just want to be clear, and I think I'm right on this, is that what we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| the monies we're proposing to pay for this contract is savings from unfulfilled positions with custodians that just have not been fulfilled, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4648)|
| 1:17:37| So we're not affecting the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Absolutely, and it is budget neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Budget neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| And then Ms. Himmelgaren and Ms. Warren referenced it earlier, and I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| Would you speak just a moment to the salary study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Because I think that's important, and I think we've already kind of gotten some bids on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| But it will not just impact custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| I mean, from my understanding, the study will actually be about our salaries across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| And then if you would just speak, why are we doing this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| What's the objective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| Yes, the salary study is looking at all of our positions, so both certified positions and classified positions, the salary schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| We are doing it as we haven't had one in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| Four years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| So we are doing it to have a third party that's an expert review our salary schedules to see if we are paying our employees at market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4702)|
| 1:18:33| comparative to other positions in the field of whatever position it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| We do anticipate a report telling us that we can then use to make recommendations in the budget for FY25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| So those would be separate from any recommendations that we may bring for FY24 in this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Well, I just want to commend the central office on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| I mean, every business has to do that every once in a while to be able to stay within the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| And like we've already commented, there's been so many changes nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| So I appreciate you all doing that and looking forward to seeing some of the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| And, again, I think because of that, it does make sense to hold back just a little bit to make these adjustments based on good data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| instead of just doing it, it's not out of a sense of reaction, but trying to do it too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4753)|
| 1:19:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| Ms. Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| I just want to echo what everyone else said, that I'm so thankful for everyone that's working really hard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| I've got a few questions, and I'm not really sure exactly who they should go to, but it piggybacks a little bit off of Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4775)|
| 1:19:43| In the contract, you know, I see the schools listed and the numbers and all of that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| but is there like a definitive guarantee that we are being given by putting this money out to say that, like, absolutely, yes, this is going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4790)|
| 1:19:59| And I understand there's that 72-hour thing, but who's going to oversee that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| So our head custodian, they will report to our head custodian, but we also have on-site and area site managers for Duncan and Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4806)|
| 1:20:19| So you'll have several eyes on the work that's being done within the school, but our head custodian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| they are the ones that will report to Ms. Hall, or they will work directly with the on-site manager or the area site manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4826)|
| 1:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| And then the background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| So it's the same company doing it, but is it that company that will house the background checks, or will Knox County Schools also get a copy of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4839)|
| 1:20:51| Madam Chair, Ms. Baik, Mr. Dupler, correct me if I'm wrong, but the results from the TBI background check would come to Knox County Schools for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4851)|
| 1:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| Yes, that's correct, and it's set by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Even the service agreement talks about the statute that refers to the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| When you're in education, it has to be a fingerprint FBI background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4874)|
| 1:21:23| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| I think my question has been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| So do we have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| And I want to thank all those involved, Dr. Adams, Ms. Hall, for the efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| So this contract goes through June 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4908)|
| 1:21:56| Are there any plans following that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| I would call these mid-range plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Madam Chair, Dr. Butler, that's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| What we're currently doing is, as we continue to recruit, we're working very closely with Dr. Hemegaran's team and job fairs and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4928)|
| 1:22:18| So we're going to actively recruit, and then we will reassess where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| And if we look at continuing on, what it would look like is a semester contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| It would not be an annual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| So if we're in the same position this summer, then we would look at a semester contract, schools of need, and then we will continue to actively recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| Once again, I've got all the confidence in the world and Dr. Hemegaran's team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| They've worked very closely with our team as far as recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| And so we're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| I think we'll be in a better place at the close of this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| But we do have some plans in place as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Thank you for mentioning the June date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| June and July are the hardest and heaviest times for our custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| And I think if I were a custodian and I finally got help and then it left between June and July, I think I would just sit on the floor and cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=4995)|
| 1:23:27| So that seems like not the most opportune time to end that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| No, that is an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| I will tell you, and this is not a great answer, but we made it happen this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| I mean, that's how we started the school year with 89 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| Our hope is that once we get once we get to that point, we can fast track some of the things that we normally do, waxing the floors and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5026)|
| 1:23:58| And so we'll be proactive in ensuring that those particular schools are ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Like I said, it's not a great answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Hopefully we'll have some some of those positions filled and we'll have we'll concentrate our focus on those areas to get those positions filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| And we'll just be proactive moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| But that's an that's an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| And we did discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| Thank you, Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Thank you, Miss Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| Again, for all your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| So moving on in items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| I'm not sure if anybody noticed it, but I am listed as a reference on the Harmony Family Center contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| That is because in my role as the executive director of the Restoration House, the Restoration House does contract with Harmony Family Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| I didn't know they were going to list me as a reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| My assumption is I'm probably one of a whole host of references that they put on all kinds of contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| So I have not discussed this contract with anybody within Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| And we actually have never used Harmony Family Center for telehealth services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| We've used them for other therapeutic services for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| But I think I can still vote on it objectively, but just want to make that known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| Thank you for disclosing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| Item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| So moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| I know for those who have been engaged in the community and been engaged in the work around the DEO and around the Alliance for Educational Equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5132)|
| 1:25:44| I know the International Institute for Restorative Practice has been a topic of conversation in the community for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| And to my knowledge, I think this is the first time that the school system may be contracting directly with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| I was wondering if – is Ms. Cook here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Ms. Cook, could you speak to just the contract and what we already do with restorative practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5159)|
| 1:26:06| and then how this will aid us in the work that we're doing with restorative practices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| So we have restorative practices in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| We've had restorative practices for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Specifically over the past four years, we have put an emphasis on providing restorative practices in our Midland High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5181)|
| 1:26:30| Jeff Wright and some of his team members have been trained in the past to utilize restorative practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| and he has been instrumental in leading the work in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| As we move forward and as I came into this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| the DEO and some community groups had asked us to look at more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5208)|
| 1:26:55| work in more collaboration with the International Institute of Restorative Practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5215)|
| 1:27:02| In fact, before I spoke at the first board meeting ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| I had been in Kentucky that day and rushed back to talk at the board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| so that was how long ago it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| So this contract is kind of the culmination of a lot of years of collaboration and conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5230)|
| 1:27:18| with them, with community agencies, and with ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| The problem that we have in Knox County is that our regions are so diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| and we can't have a one-size-fits-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| And that was kind of a push, was we need to have everybody do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| We do not need everybody in Knox County to do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| because we have different needs in different schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| So as we looked to have some of the, you know, come up with what kind of plan could we have with IIRP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5263)|
| 1:27:51| they actually came in and they met with Mr. Thomas and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| and they met with the community group, and they actually looked at all the work we had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| And they kind of agreed with me, was in Knox County, we had done a lot of work in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| and we needed to kind of move on to the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| They typically come in and do like first phase work in schools, districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| We needed to move on and do more work that was individualized for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| and more specifically focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| So that's kind of, as we look at this contract that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| we're looking to highlight and work in five schools specifically to give them support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| Each school may look something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| We will come in and the IIRP will come in and work with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| They'll help train the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| They'll support the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| They will work to create their restorative practices implementation within their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5326)|
| 1:28:54| So it's, we need to make sure that everybody understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| this is not our get out of jail free card for children who don't behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| This is high accountability with high expectations and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| You know, we have to support our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| We talk about when our kids, that we need to teach them the skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| but it's based on relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Restoration has to be built on relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| So we help staff work on how do you build relationships with children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| so that when we get to the point that there is an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| then we have something to restore back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| So it's work that, as I said, in schools, different schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| it will look slightly different, but it will have that framework of individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| what the school needs based on building relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| holding children accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| but providing the support they need to make good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| and work out how when things go wrong and they make poor decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| how do we get back on the right track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| You know, you're not just left at the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| We want to help you learn how to get back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| so that you can move forward and be productive in your education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| So this is a two-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Is it five different schools over both years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| or is it the same five schools over both years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| The same five schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Same five schools over, so total schools impacted would be five over the two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| The intensive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| We do restorative practices in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Yeah, but in terms of this contract and the way it will be leveraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| And then, Will, you mentioned that the primary focus up until now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| has been in middle school and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Are all of these schools within those particular grade bands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| or are these elementary schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| We have three elementary schools in this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Okay, so will this be the first time that we're leveraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| restorative practices in elementary schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| I think so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| We do a lot of the restorative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| We probably just don't name it as restorative practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| in the same way as we do in middle and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| But it's all about building relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| PBIS is about building relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| The PAC classroom is about building relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| and teaching the skill of what do you do when something goes wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| It's just a different level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| It's not being identified specifically like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| I didn't see it in the contract, but afterward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| can you send the list of the particular schools to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| I don't think they're in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| They're not in the contract, but they're on your fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| They're in the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| The fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| Oh, I didn't see it in the fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| I'll reference it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| So any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| Moving on to regular agenda items, we have Item 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| On this item, I've asked Dr. Reiswick to look at some additional properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| and so I'm not going to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| I don't think I'm going to be prepared to vote on this on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| so I just wanted to look at the board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| give the board members a heads up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| So are we deferring this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| So, I mean, I may on Thursday make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| just ask that we defer it, or I'll defer to Mr. Duklar on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| And I assume that that would go with the other contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| whatever we do with this one, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| We would need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Yeah, we may need to shift that contract also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Mr. Duklar, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| I would just echo what Ms. Horne is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| You know, we did have a discussion earlier today, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| included Dr. Reiswick and Dr. Adams, and, yes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| we talked about deferring, and that's we've worked further on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| and that seems to be the route to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| Mr. Watson, or did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| So, moving on, Item 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| 10C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| This is in reference to 10D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| I know that there was an arrangement put in place several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| and this is now just coming to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Can anybody speak to the specific plans that the city has with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| Sammy Hill property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| Dr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| They have not been very specific on what the plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| so we've had those conversations, but I'm not exactly sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| moving forward, what the plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| I know they had some different ideas they were kicking around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| so we just need to get our things out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| Item 10E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5660)|
| 1:34:27| F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| So, moving on to 10H, which is our legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| I think Ms. Owen has, thank you, by the way, for preparing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| I know there are two documents here everyone should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| and I'll let you explain what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| And I also believe there's a couple of documents of board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| suggestions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| I don't know if they're all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| I've not went through them all to see if they're all incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| Should we wait for them to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| Yeah, we'll take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| So we are returning to the last item on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| which is our legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Board members, you do have some documents at your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Ms. Owen, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| And thank you again for bringing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| I wanted to be sure everybody was back before we started this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| so we could look at the suggestions and where I tried to include them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| And I will say I did not include all of the suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| I'll try to go through the reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| I also didn't include one of my own suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| and I'll give you the reasons for that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| I tried to take out some superfluous language here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| like in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| So if you look at the red line copy that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| that one should be on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| The other copy you have is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| It's just without the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| It's more of a final draft version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| So it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| So I just changed some language there at the beginning to take out some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| wordiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| Then I put in the language that we used in the resolution and the seven points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5778)|
| 1:36:27| What I did not include here is the reference to where those came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| back to the state board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| If we want to put those in, we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| but it makes everything look really squishy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| So, you know, we have it in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| but we could put it here if we really want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| The next paragraph, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| already we had districts must continue to have flexibility to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| instructional and supplemental materials in partnership with teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| And this is where I tried to incorporate the literacy instruction section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5816)|
| 1:37:05| and put in including materials for reading and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| And that way that can cover whatever the district needs it to cover there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| It still says that we want that flexibility without being really specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| and saying specifically phonics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| Then on the next page, the back, this is all under funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5846)|
| 1:37:34| Most of this is just changing from BEP to TISA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| So that's what I changed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| What I would like to do here is take out the references with the BEP numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| and the 123 at the bottom that shows where those came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| I feel like we've had these long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| and everybody's used them enough that maybe we don't need those anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| However, some board members felt really strongly about them last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| so I've left them in until someone says otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| Then I added, based on our discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| increased funding for support staff such as custodians and teaching assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| So we may or may not want to keep that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Under funding levels, it used to say any new funding formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| but we know what that funding formula is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| So I put in TISA and I said TISA rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| since that's the part that's being worked on at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| TISA rules must ensure that districts receive no less than they would under BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5909)|
| 1:38:37| Then on down under strengthen and support school personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| I was urging the General Assembly to provide incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| and I added such as funding the praxis tests that I took out in high-need areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5926)|
| 1:38:55| because I felt like that was more of an overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| So what questions do we have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| What have I left out or erroneously included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| I can say that we had some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| One was literacy instruction that was specific to phonics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| but I think that's going to confuse reading and literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5955)|
| 1:39:23| so that's why I included it as I did at the bottom of the first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| The other one was for a parent's bill of rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| and since we haven't actually adopted a position on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| I don't think we can include it in our legislative priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| since we don't have a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| So the next one was, well, maybe I don't have the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5980)|
| 1:39:51| Okay, so I only have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| Is that what those are too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Are those just two different versions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Yeah, I think two different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| We also had another version that had some bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| but I think those have already been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| And I know there was some language that someone wanted added about TANF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| There is some TANF language under the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| I'm not sure if that covers what we were looking at adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| And, yes, I was going to address that, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Okay, one question just before I get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Since the funding formula has been totally redone, do we need to include this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6033)|
| 1:40:44| I'm still not sure we know enough about what the TESA funding will end up being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| and maybe we need some information from some of our staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| but that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Why do we need to include this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Because I don't want to include it if they're going to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| and say, well, we addressed that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| In the hearings with Commissioner Schwinn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| any time the legislature asked her very specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| about whether these specific things were included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| often her answer was, we cut and pasted from the BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| So if they cut and pasted from the BEP, then these things are still what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| I'm not sure that they have fleshed it out enough to be able to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| I don't think they will necessarily know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| So I think we still want to say that we need these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| because they haven't included them in any kind of specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| And one legislator even said that they keep hearing that we need school nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| and under TESA it's unclear how many school nurses there should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6115)|
| 1:42:00| so nobody will know how many there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Have you heard of legislation around funding at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| No, I've only heard of one specific piece of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| and it wasn't around funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| And then I actually didn't realize, because I had asked that the TANF funds be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| and I didn't remember that we had included that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| So that is on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| So that was one that I had asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| And then the other thing that I was curious if board members were interested in adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| the TSBA, when many of us were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| we adopted as one of the legislative priorities a review and correction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| of unnecessary requirements on educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| And it reads, this is straight from the TSBA agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| TSBA urges the Governor, General Assembly, and State Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| to establish a comprehensive, collaborative, and thoughtful review program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| of Tennessee laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| to recommend improvements to reduce educator workloads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| to facilitate teacher focus on the mission of educating Tennessee's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| So I don't know what would come of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| but I know a lot of times when we're having discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| we reference a state law or a state board rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| so I thought that that may be something that this board may want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| I think we have something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| It's at the bottom of strengthen and support school personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| It says that processes, procedures, reporting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| and burdensome data collection requirements should be streamlined and simplified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| or eliminated when possible to allow more time for teaching and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| Yes, I do think it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| I think it may be helpful to pull it out since TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| because it reiterates what TSBA will be advocating for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| so I would like to see it pulled out and be its own special little section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| And those were the two things that I had highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| How do you feel about keeping in the recommendation pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| under school nurses, counselors, and social workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| Do you want to keep those specific recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| I think we could take funding for school nurses, counselors, social workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| mental health professionals, and we could take out those bullets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| and just leave it the major bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Does anybody else have a feeling on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| I'm okay with pulling that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| If they don't do anything, we can put them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Yeah, I was going to suggest that we actually eliminate all references to BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| because I think as soon as they see that, they're going to think just what Ms. Warren said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| that, oh, we've addressed that, that must have been a hangover or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| or something left over from the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| So I would just remove the references to BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| and I do agree, Ms. Warren, with adding or delineating that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| and making it, kind of highlighting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| And I don't know whether or not we use that bullet point that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| and just kind of pull it out, under put its own section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| actually like the way the TSBA language read on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| I think it will all fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6336)|
| 1:45:45| Are you looking at that language from our book we had or from what they sent out later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| I think it's a hard copy, so I'm not sure where I got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| I think they sent it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| I believe it's in the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| I think it was on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Will you flip that around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Can I see the front of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| I think it's straight from their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| I must have printed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| I think they sent it out to us in the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| Mr. Trickler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6375)|
| 1:46:16| I would like to see the section on parents' bill of rights added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| and I kind of combined some of what Ms. Anderson put on there with mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| but a parents' bill of rights and then just supporting the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| and their efforts to protect women's sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| and prohibit explicit content from libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| I just appreciate some of the things they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| and I'd like to support those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| and I felt like they all kind of fit under that parents' and students' rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| so I'd like to see those added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Currently there's a lengthy list of parent rights that's on the state website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| I'll bring that next time and make sure everybody has a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| so that we don't look at something that's going to conflict with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6413)|
| 1:47:00| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| I agree with Mr. Triplett, and I actually did revise mine, the old copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| It says parents' and students' rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| and I did have Terry provide a revise that said parental transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| I just think it's important to add this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| I think several of us, I know I've heard from parents over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| they do have those rights, but I think the challenge is they're unaware of those rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| and I think that we need to make sure that we're as transparent as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| I know that this is important at the state level coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| and so I just think it adds clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| It doubles down on parental involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| and it just codifies everywhere where parents do have those rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| So I personally would like to see that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| and I do agree with Mr. Triplett's additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| I think they kind of work well together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| and it just reinforces what some of the state has already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| We spent a lot of time looking at the academic and retention decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| and making sure that it was very specific, and this doesn't have that specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6477)|
| 1:48:05| For example, we don't have what we would consider apparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| how that fits in with guardians, which I think if we say parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| that's going to leave out a huge swath of people who are guardians of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| We can change the word to guardian. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| I just think it's important to have it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| and I'm happy to add it and come to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| If it loses, it loses. If it wins, it wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| Just to be for clarification, the document we have, there's two sections here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6513)|
| 1:48:41| parents and student rights and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| So the parents and student rights looks like it is kind of the combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| between what Mr. Triplett and you proposed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| So what you're saying is you want this in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| So on the bottom of this, there's also the literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| Right. I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Addressed with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| I would like to see it a little bit more specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| just because we need to equip our teachers with what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| and literacy has been such an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| It is at the forefront of every conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| and I think that we have to make sure that the teachers are teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| and giving them the equipment that they need to make our kids successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| So I would like to see it specific with the language that I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| I think we might need someone from the staff to address the difference in reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| and literacy to discuss why that might not be the best language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| Is there someone who can address the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| I do also think it addresses the fact that phonics is becoming more on the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| at the state level too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Dr. Wilson, you look like you are ready to jump in on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Well, actually, I would be happy to have Dr. Phillips come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| and answer any questions about the differences in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| I will say, as I have been sort of texting and talking to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| they don't have that actual document in front of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| with what is said currently about phonics and literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| so you'll have to probably catch her up to speed on what that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| in terms of changing that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| I can provide you with a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6622)|
| 1:50:33| So the question then was in relation to the differences between reading and literacy, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| Right, because this is talking about literacy instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| but then we are sort of conflating reading with literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| and I think that is going to be very problematic for the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| when we are looking at those two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| So I think it is important for us to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| first, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I think it is important for us to understand the process of learning to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| and that entails more than phonics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| So when we think about foundational literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| we are developing phonological awareness, which is the broad umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| Then we are breaking it down to phonemic awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| which is that each letter is represented with one sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| however we are not making a grapheme association, which is the letter association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| Then we move into phonics, which is that one-to-one correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| between a letter and a sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| or grapheme mapping, which allows us to associate letter combinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| for specific sounds within our English language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| So those are all ways that we build up students to learn to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| Once we have broken the code and we have the ability to decode successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| now we are reading and we are making meaning from what we read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| We are still encouraging making meaning from what we read all along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| as we build our competencies and our skills-based competencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Those skills-based competencies enable us to be able to break the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| and decode and be proficient readers and writers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| I think it is important as we address learning to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6721)|
| 1:52:07| we think about the specific components around foundational literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| that enable our kids to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Then when you think about reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| what is the main goal of reading that you want to attend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| in whatever language you put before the audience in which we will read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| We want students to make meaning from text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| We want students to be able to engage in critical thinking around what they are reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| We want students to be able to respond both orally and in writing to what they are reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| and to be able to make arguments against what they are reading for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| what they are reading, to be able to employ that critical thinking component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| I don't know if I fully addressed your question, so I will stay right here if you have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| Well, it is not that it is so much my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| I think I just want to be sure that the board understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| that reading and literacy are not the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| Reading is an element of literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| It is one way to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| If we are talking about phonics for literacy, that is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| I don't want to confuse the legislature with that language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| because when we are looking at phonics, we are looking at that base of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| That is not necessarily going to lead us to literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| It is going to lead us to reading, but there is much more involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| I think, if I could add one more thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| I think what I am thinking of in response to what you have just said, Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| is that decoding and encoding are reciprocal processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| When a student has a firm foundation in phonics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| they employ that knowledge in the element of reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| but also in the element of writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Literacy is a comprehensive aspect of learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| that engages students in not only decoding for the purpose of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| but encoding for the purpose of responding to what we read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| I don't know if I have helped you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| No, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| The place that I tried to incorporate that is at the bottom of the first page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| where it says districts must continue to have flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| to adopt instructional and supplemental materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| in partnerships with teachers and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| including materials for reading and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| I think that would better cover the swath of materials necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| rather than only including phonics, which is going to be very limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| The piece that it looks like I have failed to include is teacher trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| We might want to add that back in, including teacher trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| materials, and reading and literacy instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| Would that cover that same idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| Can you say that again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| Flexibility to adopt instructional and supplemental materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| in partnerships with teachers and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| including materials and trainings for reading and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6911)|
| 1:55:20| We could add including appropriate materials and trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| for reading and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6924)|
| 1:55:32| I'm going to add that to support the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6932)|
| 1:55:43| I said that last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| Knox County Board of Education urges the state legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| to continue to support the science of reading through teacher trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| and materials for literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6953)|
| 1:56:03| Go to Mr. Butler and let me think about this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| This is just mine for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| I was looking at the draft that Jennifer gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6971)|
| 1:56:20| I thought we were adding to that, but it seems like, Ms. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6980)|
| 1:56:29| you went back to the literacy instruction one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| Which one are we amending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| We're starting with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| If we're doing that one, we would be including what I'm hearing you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| as including materials for the support to support the science of reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7006)|
| 1:56:56| training, teacher training, and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| That was the question I had asked Ms. Henderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| because these items are the ones that were suggested by the other board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7024)|
| 1:57:13| to incorporate into the draft, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7033)|
| 1:57:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| I think we want to support the needs of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| instead of supporting the science of reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| If we want to support the needs of our students with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7052)|
| 1:57:50| Did that answer your question, Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| Did we answer your question about trying to incorporate the suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7073)|
| 1:58:01| It would include that second sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| Urges the state legislative bodies to continue to support the science of reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| through teacher trainings and materials for literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| What if we said including appropriate data-based materials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| Would that cover the science?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| Adding that to the end of that sentence in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| Including appropriate data-supported materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7107)|
| 1:58:35| and training for reading and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| Does that cover it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| Can you start from the beginning of the sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| Districts must continue to have flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| to adopt instructional and supplemental materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| in partnership with teachers and with families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| including appropriate data-supported materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| and trainings for reading and literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7139)|
| 1:59:10| I'd like to keep it the last sentence but then include that at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| So Knox County Board of Education urges state legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| to continue to support the science of reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| through teacher trainings and materials for literacy instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| including appropriate data materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| Do you have something that defines the science of reading for the purpose of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| I can include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7175)|
| 1:59:58| It's basically a phonics-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| But let me draft something real fast about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7201)|
| 2:00:09| So it sounds like with this draft, it sounds like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7209)|
| 2:00:18| we'll have two versions maybe to consider on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Because I know you're saying you feel strongly about keeping the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| parental and student rights portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| That's what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| And so we need to either squeeze that in or maybe have two versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7236)|
| 2:00:46| Historically, we have not added anything in our priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| that we haven't taken some kind of position on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| or had some kind of discussion regarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| So that is problematic to me to include something that we haven't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| public discussion about at all as a legislative priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7262)|
| 2:01:12| I also think we've had the same legislative priorities for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| and years without changing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| And I think each year the point of this is to update them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| Well, there seems to me to be a lot of red on this page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| so that's definitely not what was there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| So if there's a switch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| it's sounding like there's a disagreement on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| So it sounds like, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| probably what we need to do is have we probably need to have two versions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| And then if you can incorporate your language into the other working draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| that we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| That's fine, and I can include Mr. Triplett's in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| since it goes along with the parental transparency piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| if that's okay with you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| And then Ms. Horne's suggestion of the wording change on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7325)|
| 2:02:14| Yes, it would just be adding the TSBA wording on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| and correction of unnecessary requirements on educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| So did anybody feel strongly about not, about keeping the BEP references in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| Are we all in agreement that the BEP references need to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| Does everybody...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| Yeah, I think everybody is taking those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| And to be clear, we're taking out that whole section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| not just the reference, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| We're taking out the bullet points, school nurses, counselors, social workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| because they are in the main bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| So it still has those all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| We're just not breaking it down to the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| Or do you want to keep the numbers and just take out the BEP references?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| I think we should take all of it out, and I think it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| I almost think we should acknowledge under this section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| that there has been additional funding added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| I think there needs to be some acknowledgement that they've taken action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| Can we say continued funding to make it clear that that has increased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| Any ideas, everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Because, I mean, they've added significantly to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| We just don't understand what that impact is going to be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| So I think we need to acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| Otherwise, I think we lose credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| So you could say something like that, like acknowledging that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| the state has added additional funding we would like for you to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| Those efforts may be something you'd have to wordsmith that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| I'll work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| There was also, I mean, there's one other kind of language thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| that we've kind of talked a little bit about back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| and that is between Mr. Triplett's version and Ms. Henderson's version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| parents and students' rights and parental transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| Actually, in that version, I actually prefer the parental transparency version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| only because I believe that our parents' student rights is already enumerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| And to me, it sounded like, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| you were trying to more communicate to the legislature that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| although yes, parents' rights are enumerated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| that there needs to be more information and transparency about what those rights are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| And to me, in that version of it, I would prefer seeing that language versus the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| I don't have a problem with the transparency language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| So this was the first one, the parents' and student rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| was the one I brought a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| And so the parental transparency is my updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| so that is the language that I would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| Ms. Hoyt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate that language, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| for the parental transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| Also, I'm still going back to the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| I'm still wondering whether we should pull out the TANF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| We have it under funding, which obviously is an appropriate place for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| You want it separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| It should be separate, going back to the same reason on the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| just to match the TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| And we don't know if they're using that at all, and that's a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| and we need to be advocating for that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| Ms. Henderson, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| So does anyone have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| Ms. Owen, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| I think I've got it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| You think you've got it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Yes, and I will try to send everybody a copy tomorrow to see if I've made errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| if you'll get with Ms. Coatney and let her know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| So moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7583)|
| 2:06:24| We have one speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| Lance, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| You know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Madam Chairman, members of the board, thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| I wanted to talk about the custodian issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| but I want to correct a couple of things that I heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| One was that the custodians are being paid $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| That number is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| Our custodians are not actually getting $15 worth of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| It's $10.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| The payroll taxes brings it to less than $12 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| You only get $15 an hour if custodians take health insurance benefits equal to the average of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7625)|
| 2:07:13| which would cost them $2,500 a year out of a $20,000 salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| So you can be sure that very few of the custodians who are supporting themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| and not having an outside source of income can afford to take our health insurance benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7642)|
| 2:07:28| The other number I'd like to point out is that we raised the pay of our custodians 16% in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7648)|
| 2:07:36| Well, that means that we were paying them $8.60 two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| So 16% sounds like a lot, but when you start with that base, it's not nearly as generous as it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7661)|
| 2:07:49| But I want to focus your attention on the bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| We have places for 669 TEAs in this district, and we are 20% down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7672)|
| 2:08:02| If you go to the website, there's 146.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| Last time I looked at vacancies, those people are paid less than $19,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| So, yeah, and it's a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| We don't have enough substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| We also know we don't have enough teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| That's a long-term problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| I appreciate that you're doing a salary study, but 2025 is way too long to drag our students through the shortage of staff that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7700)|
| 2:08:33| You know, we know that the salary study is going to be a lot more than what we're paying custodians, EAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7713)|
| 2:08:40| So waiting until then to raise the wages doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| It's just putting off and subjecting our students to another whole school year of understaffed schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| You know, I think that there's really only one solution, and the board needs to say to our superintendent and say, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7732)|
| 2:09:03| We have to pay a market rate for our staff because otherwise we are not going to fill it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| All the fancy things we want to do and stuff is just not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| So let's be realistic and look at what businesses are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| They are responding to the market by raising their rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| For us to do not is like that's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| So, you know, let's act now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| We can't solve the custodian contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| Maybe what we need to do now, but let's not spend another year sitting on our hands because, oh, we don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| We know that at least part of it is adequate market rate wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| Board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| Sorry, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| Seven thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| Miss Deckard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| I just want to say I hope everyone had a great first day and is able to finish off the spring semester strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Robert Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| Miss Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| If someone from the staff could talk with PBA about the acoustics in this room, I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| What I hear from board members is that board members are hearing noise from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| And what I hear from the audience is that they can't hear the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| So there's there's some kind of issue with this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| I mean, obviously, being a long room like this, the acoustics are going to be horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| But if PBA could take a look at that, maybe that would help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| I think they're working on some better mics to acoustics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| It's not a microphone issue because it's, you know, the audience isn't mic'd and we can hear them better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| They can hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| But for them hearing us, I think that they're working on some better mics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7845)|
| 2:10:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| Miss Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230109?start=7862)|
