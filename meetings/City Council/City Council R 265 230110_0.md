| 0:26:39| resolution, so our opposition is to ask that you broaden the scope because ultimately the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| root of what has prompted the frustration with the South Waterfront Code is not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1604)|

| 0:27:15| would require more time and effort, it's the only win-win scenario and would result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1635)|

| 0:27:28| Instead, we're just messing with the review process that will likely extend development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1648)|

| 0:27:42| It's definitely not developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1662)|

| 0:28:26| It requires an extraordinary amount of hubris to suggest that a more than 15-year-old code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| that has had no major revisions since its implementation is beyond reproach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| It hasn't been changed by and large in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| And it happens to be our first attempt at a form-based code, and it's unreasonable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| expect that it was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| And it isn't perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| It's not – it's great, but there are necessary revisions that need to be made, and it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| common for cities to revisit their code after a period of 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| So our opposition is rooted in asking that this resolution ask more of the city, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| we do more to address the root problem rather than the symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| Mr. Smith, I think you had your light on first, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| I appreciate the comments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| I agree with almost all of the sentiments that were expressed by the speakers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| I think there was general consensus among the lack of clarity last month, and so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| reason I brought this forward particularly is related to a very acute issue in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| which is the distinguishment between Level 2 and Level 3 in the South Waterfront Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| It needs clarity, and I'm hopeful that this resolution is something we can all be on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| I'm also hopeful that, like Mr. Sales' comments, this is the next step in clarifying what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| development expectations are, particularly for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I just want to add some more context for this, not to belabor the point, but there are three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| aspects of the form-based code that have been consistent feedback that need adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| One is transparency around the administrative review committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| That currently happens not in public view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| I want to thank the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| There's a live website now, so any development in the form-based district code, form-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| district areas, is now on the website for anybody to review while it's under scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| of the administrative review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| The second was notification of variances, and I'm excited to see that that fix is before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| us tonight as Item 12E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| So two big changes that I think are going to be really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And the third is this issue, which I think, together with those other three, will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| a strong change to the code that was established back in 2006 and set the course for the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| And I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you, Mayor, for your comments earlier around February 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| That will be kind of a full public forum for the next chapter of the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| So I'm excited about this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| It's specific, it's clear, and I think it has general consensus of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| I think this is a very necessary resolution, and I just ask to be added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Council Member Thomas and then Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Yes, I would like to be added as a co-sponsor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Councilman Smith, so is the intent that we actually fix the review process in this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1900)|
| 0:31:49| but it doesn't stop there because I think some of what Mr. Sale says is true, when every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1909)|
| 0:31:58| project has to have variances, then it lends itself to the frustration of the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| So I can support this if I feel confident that we're going to then fix the underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Otherwise, I would probably like to add something that says we're going to do this by this date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| and then do the form-based code by a year from now or something just to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| this isn't where we leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Can I ask a question that might tack on and you might answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Everybody gets a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| You need to give one answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Go ahead, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| No, my question might, so in the resolution it says community advisory group, so maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| in answering her question, elaborate what the community advisory group is because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| need some clarification of who all that encompasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Council Member McKenzie, would you like to add on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| I just want to sign on as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| We'll take that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| So I think, assuming that this is important to you now as it was when we voted on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| workshops, I think this year we should have a workshop around form-based districts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| I would like that to be a collaborative effort with this body and that be the kind of next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| phase of review for the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Regarding the community group, I'll leave that to, I think there's plenty of members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| here from South Knoxville that would be willing to participate in that, so I don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| specific plan for that, but I think the administration is willing to form a small committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| There was a big committee back in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Given this is not from scratch, I think a smaller committee would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| Council Member Rudger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| So to clarify, do the landowners qualify as community advisory group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I didn't want to use the D word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| It's not a dirty word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| I just wanted to say that I don't think Councilman Smith's resolution precludes any of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| of Mr. Sales and I think it's a step in the right direction just as far as continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2069)|

| 0:34:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| We talked earlier today and I was saying to you that every time I hear about downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2100)|
| 0:35:11| I hear two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| One about how great it's doing, all the businesses, all the activities, all the growth there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| but then is the concern about the homeless population and how that is being taken care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| of and that's a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| We have to take care of the least amongst us, but also the people who are coming to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| And I know a lot of people who have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| So I just wanted to ask, I know you guys are playing a part of tending to that and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| wanted to hear about all the things that you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Michelle Hummel, 17 Market Square, Knoxville 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| To address, obviously, panhandling and homelessness is an issue at downtown, UT, the city, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| You know, we see it on corners when you get off the interstate and everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So I think it's something that needs to be addressed and is currently being addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| by community, the legislature, and it's just something we can continue to work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2165)|

| 0:36:25| reduce homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| The city does a lot with housing to help address that issue, and I think it's just something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| that we work with together as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| We have worked together with the city, Visit Knoxville, and Knox County for the Block by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Block, the ambassador program that is currently downtown, and they are addressing and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| to help that issue as well, and trying to find a compassionate balance between homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| but also some of the problems that we see with panhandling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| So we continue to work with the city, Office of Homelessness, KPD, and other community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| partners to better address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2217)|

| 0:38:51| It's my understanding this is a five-year pilot and we're looking at 800 residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| units for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Rebecca Jane Justice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I believe it's 838 new units, which would comprise over 2,000 actual bedrooms, 2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| parking spaces, but yeah, five years, 838 new household apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| Rebecca Jane Justice is the expert here on this, so Ms. Justice, could you elaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you, Councilman Roberto, for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| So this is a 830 residential unit, approximately 2,000 beds and just under 2,000 units of structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| parking, but what we're incentivizing here is structured parking, which also supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| the residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| So the structured parking wouldn't happen without the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| And then there is a, you know, there's definitely a need for student housing at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| I mean, it wasn't that long ago that I think we were watching on the television students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| waiting outside, you know, overnight to, you know, sign up for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| So there's definitely a need for housing at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| What I wanted to ask you about as well is obviously we, the way that the Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| Avenue streetscape has been set up is really to promote walkability and, you know, less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| high-speed traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| What do you think the impact on the area will be with having, you know, additional students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| living there in that proximity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Well, I think that this, the Cumberland Avenue streetscape was definitely an incentive made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| by, or an investment made by the city to attract just this type of investment, to concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| it in this area close to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| And also the structured parking allows for storage of those vehicles of all the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| which we know students want cars, people want to drive their cars to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| But this structured parking is also a place for collaboration with nearby businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| specifically Children's Hospital and Covenant, Fort Sanders, for their employee parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| So it really addresses a multifaceted issue in the area to incentivize the structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| So not only does it help us address our housing needs, but also creative solutions to parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| and helping people find a place to possibly park and then walk to class every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| So maybe your car stays parked all week while you live and go to school in the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| or you come and go to work and shop in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| So the incentivizing the parking area you think will bring on less traffic and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2504)|
| 0:41:54| pedestrian walking to businesses, to school, to class, things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| We certainly think that investing in the assistance with the parking structure helps find a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| that if this area were developed only with retail and residential, there would be a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| for parking considering this lot at this time is currently surface parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2540)|

| 0:42:23| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| I have a comment and a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| One comment is that the city has recently produced 13 key development priorities, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| so I think it's important to realize that whether it's affordable housing or whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| it's incentivized walking, pedestrian use, and lack of parking, there are certain priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| that a project has to qualify for to receive a pilot, and pilots are available for $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| projects and $500 million projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| And so I think that's really important as a reminder to the public that these incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| are no cash outlay for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| They're also available for tiny, small commercial redevelopments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| So these are not just limited to the biggest developers in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| So I would suggest in future packets that those 13 priorities be outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| If a pilot qualifies for 10 of those 13, I think we should list those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| I think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| If those are the priorities for this incentive, it should be included in our understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| And then I had a question for the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Is someone here from the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2609)|
| 0:43:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Jared Shank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Good to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Nice to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| We've spoken on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| One of the things that I wanted to make sure that I brought up was the public parking aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| of this is good for Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| It's also good for the two priority hospitals in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| So that's very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| What's also important is that we're going to offer any kind of public incentive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| we not displace anybody forever if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| And so when I called you, my request of you was to make sure that those existing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| in this block are at least made a good faith offer to return after the development is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| So I was just asking you to come forward and maybe describe, is that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| What response you've had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| No, we're, listen, we're very excited to be here and invest in this community and be long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| owners in this community and support the local retail community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| And, you know, we're bringing 30,000 square feet of brand new retail space that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| will have a dramatic and impactful long-term impact to the pedestrian experience, to making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| for the hospital workers, for the families, for everyone that's living in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| And so, yes, as we are talking to retail tenants about moving out, we're specifically saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| to them, and we want you to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| So we've had conversations with Campus Cuts, with Hibachi, with the Jimmy Johns coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| back, and we're going to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| And we're looking to hire a local retail broker to facilitate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| And we'd love nothing more than to populate, you know, our retail space with local retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| to drive the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| That means a lot to the local retailers that are there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| Some of them have been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Some of them will find another home for the next two or three years while construction ensues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Some of those properties, as a reminder, are empty and blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| And so while it's possible to put new retailers in, I appreciate that you've been in over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| backwards to make room for existing tenants to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Now, they're going to have a hard time for a couple years because construction is messy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| but that's not a requirement of this, and you committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| So I wanted to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Could you just state your name for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| I know you said it, but could you say it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Jared Shank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| And you're with the Core Knoxville Cumberland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| I think Ms. Parker was next, and then Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| This is actually for the owner if he doesn't mind sticking around a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| I was wondering if you could share with the public a few details about the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| to anticipate what type of housing will be available, what will be the price point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| that housing, some of those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| The project will have four mixed-use buildings, you know, construction starting in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| of this year, delivering two of the buildings in 2025 and two of the buildings in 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| And the unit mix is really going to run the gamut, and it's going to start with micro-units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| that, you know, in essence, we would love to have anybody live there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I mean, it's open housing for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| So to the extent we have visiting professors, if we have professionals working in the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| system, they'll be attracted to our efficiency one-bedroom, two-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| But then it'll also run up to fours and fives also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| So it'll be market rate, and the market will really dictate what that rental rate, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| know, will be for those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| And the retail on the ground floor, we are putting vehicular parking behind our ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| floor retail to take off, you know, all the curb cuts that are up and down Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| People come and park, you know, coming up 19th off of 20th and park behind the retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| bays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| And I think that it's also important to know that the one centralized garage, we also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| will eliminate a lot of traffic up and down Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| People living in the other buildings will park at the main garage because, again, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| see the parking more as a warehouse than sort of a daily thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| And so hopefully we'll activate the corridor in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| And then I had a question for Ms. Rebecca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Ms. Justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| We have different, you know, details before us for this pilot compared to the next pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| we will review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| How is the decision made whether any subsidized housing will be included in the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| Is that just what the developer brings to the city, or does the city try to negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| there being some lower income housing in the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| It's definitely a collaborative approach to discuss and, you know, create a project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| works for the city and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| The developer always approaches us with their ideas, and it's always at various stages in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| And we certainly share with them our development priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| And with certain projects, certain things are more appropriate in different redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| areas than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| So you'll see in the next project the inclusion of workforce housing in a certain area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| more appropriate in the context of the development overall than specifically this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| I have concerns about this pilot, and I've raised those concerns previously with similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2957)|
| 0:49:27| projects, but I'm struggling to see the public benefit that would warrant this pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2967)|
| 0:49:38| With the housing crisis that we are experiencing, any housing project that receives an incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| from us has to provide some sort of workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And why we would need workforce housing or some sort of subsidized housing in a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| area confounds me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| Yes, students have access to more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Maybe that's how they're able to pay these high rents in a pinch, but students need affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| And so to perhaps prioritize a shorter pilot over trying to get some units in there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3010)|
| 0:50:24| students can afford concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| That should be a priority of our city, and we should definitely see students as a demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| need in affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| So that's the reason why I'm not able to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| I have real concerns about how these housing developments will impact the cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3039)|
| 0:50:50| for students in our city moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Councilmembers, I just wanted to draw your attention to, we have key development priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| and that's Councilmember Smith alluded to those, and they're open on our website, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| our applicants for tax incentives look through that and talk to Ms. Justice and the economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| development team about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And I believe this project is very deserving of this incentive because of the sheer volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| of the houses that they're going to provide, which is project type is one criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| Expansion of permanent housing supply is a top priority listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Project location is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| Project characteristics, and another one that's really important, and this one integrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| project integration with public amenities and transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| As was discussed earlier, the city's invested, I think, $25 million into the streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| improvements at Cumberland Avenue, specifically to incentivize private investment of higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| density mixed use developments along that corridor for all the entities, UT, hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| businesses, residences who live in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| Walkability requires density, and so this fits a lot of the things that are there publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| listed along with the process map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| I'm really proud of our team that has come up with this very explicit and transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| It's more easier for developers to review it and understand it than ever before, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| it's more explicit for the public to understand what the public benefits are that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| It's not just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| It's many things, and you can read those details on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| So I'm supporting this because I think the parking is desperately needed, and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| in support of our hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| To me, that's a public benefit that's worth supporting for a five-year pilot for the permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| parking that it's bringing to those hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| The reimbursement rates for health care are constantly going backwards, but the expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| in the hospitals are constantly moving forward, and in the past, we've debated and argued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| here on the dais when the hospitals have needed to eat up and nibble away at the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| housing stock there to create parking, and that was a huge and contentious debate, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3201)|
| 0:53:30| I feel like this solves part of that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| You have, you know, a lot of community and neighborhood over there that lives on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| bubble of not being there anymore because of the hospital's needs for parking and expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| and if we can alleviate that, I think that that is worth, you know, the pilot and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| I also think creating more units over there is going to help stymie the costs that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| being charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| The reason that they can charge the rates over there that they can, which are outrageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| for student housing is because there's a wait list for student housing, and there's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| not enough to meet the demand, and those folks are in turn coming out and putting pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| and escalating rents in our neighborhoods and our communities further beyond, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| driving, so they're not walking to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| They're having to drive in and park because they don't have a place nearby to live, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| they're being shuttled around by UT from hotels, and so, you know, there's clear there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| a need, and there's clearly a need with the hospitals for the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| Before I go to you, Mr. Thomas, I forgot someone has signed up to speak on this, and I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| see that until just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Patrick Birmingham, Mr. Birmingham, if you could come to the podium, state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| I'm sorry, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Patrick Birmingham, 280 Fort Sanders West Boulevard, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| Actually, Councilman Ryder probably stated my remarks most eloquently about the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| that we have in health care and the need for the additional parking, and that's one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| the reasons why I wanted to speak on behalf of Covenant Health, that we are in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| of this development and obviously the pilot that you all are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| It's critically important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| It's 212 parking spaces that we will get on a surface lot right now that we probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| 65, and that helps us in a sundry different ways, not only with patient parking, but employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| parking and those people that are visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| And Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center is a major tertiary care facility, so, in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| words, there's a lot of patients that come from outside Knoxville, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| and being able to reasonably find parking and be able to get into the hospital either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| for care or to see their loved ones is critically important, and that's part of the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| of this project that we think are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Mr. Thomas, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| Just a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| The concerns that were addressed about or brought up about the present business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| the local business owners, that was one of my primary concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| And when we think of pilots and redeveloping property, we generally look toward property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| that is blighted, that needs to be reclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| In this instance, there are apparently some people that have ongoing businesses that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| going to have to relocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| However, I appreciated the concerns that the developers expressed in their efforts into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| reaching out to the people who have those ongoing businesses and to bring them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| That was an issue that I'd heard some from the public, and it comforts me somewhat about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| this pilot, that that attitude is being taken, because, you know, first, we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| do harm to people, of course, who have invested in the community and have had ongoing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| So the extent that you can make those efforts and bring these existing owners back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| that's a laudable thing, and it relieves some of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| The other issue is about the parking, and this is a bit of an aside, but over years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| I've seen the demand for parking actually lead to the demolition of Victorian houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| in Fort Sanders, and I don't know if this ongoing parking situation or this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| will help alleviate that, but I hope it is, because over time, for people who have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| in Knoxville for a while, as I have, we've lost a lot of housing stock in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| that was actually very valuable, and that community of Victorian houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| actually part of it rivaled sections you would see in New Orleans or San Francisco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| and you can see remnants of that that are still left, and it's my hope that we preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| what's left of that, and I hope that adding non-surface parking, as in this situation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| and a lot of it will alleviate any more pressure to destroy what's remaining of that existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3508)|
| 0:58:39| historic housing stock, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you, Council Member Thomas. Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you, Mayor. I think they're two different things. Everything my colleagues have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| about needing the parking, needing the housing, all of that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| The second part of this is, does the developer need a pilot to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| Doing the parking garage is not a charitable endeavor. There will be long-term leases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| with the hospitals. I think this developer, first off, I have to thank you to RJ for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3547)|
| 0:59:15| I know you did a lot of work on the usual pilots we used to give were 20, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| so I do appreciate that there was a lot of hard work put into this, but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| the developer has enough resources and they are not risk-averse and would do this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| without public funding, so I'm not voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| Any other questions or discussion? Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| Thank you. I just want to say we talk a lot about we assume a developer can afford to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| That's why we have a third-party entity look at what is a reasonable rate of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| for the amount of risk that developers take. That assessment has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| That's why it's not a 10-year pilot. They don't need it for 10 years. It's a 5-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| So, once again, I understand that we often think just because people are developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| and do really big projects, they don't need help, but the public benefit of this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| is why the city considered it, and it's only 5 years, and so in 5 years we get the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| of all that new tax revenue, which is a public benefit for all the other things we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you, Council Member Fugate. Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Yeah. Rebecca Jane. Miss Justice. Montgomery. Sorry. I only call you by your first name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3643)|
| 1:00:54| Can you walk us through the Municap report here real quick to be clear on the rates of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| and the assumptions that were made there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| I can't. I don't have it in front of me. I have it in my jacket here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| It's page 21 of... I don't know. I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| All right. Every time there's mention of a Municap report, I get excited, so I had to jump up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| I'm so glad that I hit the mark for a couple of people here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| What do you want to know specifically? I mean, generally what we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| What's the rate of return? Are these guys making a 10% pocket money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| With the pilot, it's 9.9%. Without it, it was 9.3%, and I will say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| With the pilot, it's what, and without it, it was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| It's 9.3% without and 9.9% with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| You all are probably accustomed to seeing a 12% return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| We have been working really hard to whittle that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| I'm actually surprised the development team can sit in the room with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| because we pushed hard on them, and this is... It is a little subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| You all are right. The questions that you pose are really important ones to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| We can never know the exact amount of incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| that will encourage the developer to do a deal like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| In this instance, because of the infusion of housing supply into the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| because of the parking that's being added, we felt like that very short...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| So the last student housing deal that we did on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| was 6 1⁄2 years with a 3-year construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| We've whittled that back to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| We feel like we're going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| We've still got some work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| but I think overall the project benefits are going to be huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| and this is a very reasonable return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| much lower than what we have targeted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| So the difference is .6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| .6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| And what's the dollar value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| It's about $17 million in the context of a $530 million development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| Because it's very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| And just to be clear, to make it clear for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| a bank looks at a project like this and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| I'll loan you this amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| I'm trying to figure it out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I'll loan you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| I mean, what are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| I mean, are we talking construction costs including contingencies, $446 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| And then what we're doing with the .6% is we're closing the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| between what the loan is and what the actual construction costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| You caught my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Bringing up the last project, which I also did not support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| with your statement that we're moving in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| because that's what I'm pushing back on, is what should our priority be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| The public benefit, what outcome the project has for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| or getting properties back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| And I keep hearing, let's get the properties on the tax rolls as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| We have to use these incentive programs to get the infrastructure in the city that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Right now we need affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| Yeah, we need parking too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| But I would much rather see a longer pilot come before me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| and know that 200 of those 800 units actually are affordable to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| than to know that that's a huge project that will be back on the tax rolls in five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| but with no guarantees that that money is going to go directly into an affordable housing trust fund, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| So let's use this moment now to get what we need for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| That's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| As we think about future projects, when they want to come and negotiate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| affordable housing has to be at the top of that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| not just getting properties back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| Council members, I just wanted to bring to your attention that this pretty short pilot, five years only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| is not taking away any tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| In fact, it's going to increase our tax revenue, as Ms. Fugate mentioned, to the tune of 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| Once the pilot period is over, we'll have $2.1 million in tax revenue annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| to use towards affordable housing, to use for infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| to use towards subsidizing other social services that we want to support in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| So this is a big win for people who want to support affordable housing and social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| and walkable communities in Cumberland and our hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| I think it's just a real opportunity, and I appreciate everybody who's willing to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=3959)|

| 1:07:06| We do have one person signed up to speak on this, Janice Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| If you'd come to the podium, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4030)|
| 1:07:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| My name is Janice Toker, 326 Taylor Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| When I first saw this item on the agenda, my initial thought was to request this item be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| until the community could be engaged through a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| which has already been scheduled for February 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| It's been over 16 years that the South Waterfront Vision Plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| For 16 years, there's been no discussion with regards to a pedestrian bridge over the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| It seemed this project was on the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Then in March of this year, news started spreading about the impending partnership of UT Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| the city, and Knox County in a proposal to build a pedestrian bicycle bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| which will connect campus to the south shore of the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Whoa, that's big news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And yet again, there's been no public meeting to inform the community of these plans or get feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| Perhaps the city needs to be reminded that the best way to get people on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| and with a shared vision is to provide transparency through public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| I have learned that this resolution is an urgent matter due to a deadline for the submission of the grant proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| Therefore, instead of asking this vote be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| I am requesting those involved in writing the grant be required to attend the February 13th meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4125)|
| 1:08:55| specifically for engaging the public and getting feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| especially from the residents that will be impacted by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| I expect to see that public input incorporated into the grant that is submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Thank you, Ms. Toker. I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I was going to say I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| In 2000, we kicked off the nine counties, one vision process that talked about what the community wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4158)|
| 1:09:27| talked about downtown, and a big part of that was reconnecting to our waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| and not turning our back on the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| And a mention of a pedestrian bridge was discussed that far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| So I agree with you, Ms. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| It hasn't been talked about a lot until recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| and I imagine that has to do with the fact that there may actually be funding available to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| But I'm pleased that we're going to at least ask for someone to help us write a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| and I agree with you there will need to be a lot of public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| That's what we did 20-something years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| That's what you did 16 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| And so I have high hopes that this can reconnect us to the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| and it's another safe way to get from south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| We can walk across the Gay Street Bridge, but it's not as nice as a purely pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| Thank you, Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| Just before I move on to you, Mr. Smith, I just wanted to provide a little further context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| This specific idea first came to the public attention during Nine Counties, One Vision at the end of, like, 99-2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4232)|
| 1:10:41| Then it was more formalized as part of the South Waterfront Vision in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| which has been alluded to several times tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| And then in 2015, Mayor Rojero and her administration applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| and got a TIGER grant or didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| We applied for but didn't get a grant from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| So this has been part of the city's goals and this community's goals for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| We do need more public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| We can't rely on input from 20 years ago or even six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| We need to freshen that up, and that's exactly why this is on the agenda tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| because we need help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| This is not a simple application like for a community garden or a park bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| It requires a lot of, you know, detailed construction estimates and specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| and that's why we're hiring CDM Smith, if you all approved us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| to help us conduct more community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| We will ask that they attend the February 13th public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| But this is a heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| We need their help to get it done and to have a chance of winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| It's a $55 million project at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| It will, if we are able to move forward and do this big thing that we've been trying to do for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| I think it's going to be an amazing asset to our community if we do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| And this is the beginning of the process 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| And so I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| I agree that we need community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| I also think CDM Smith is going to help us not only collect that input but write a winning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Mr. Brace, what is the urgency of this grant and why can't it wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| Well, I think Mayor Kincaid brought up the fact that we've aligned partnerships with, you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| the county, the city, UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| We've chatted with the Aslan Foundation, who has significant holdings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| and obviously with you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| So the grant is actually due in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| The previous raised grants were actually due in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| And this round is just backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| It's backed up in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| But the timing actually works pretty well with this community meeting that we've got set at Crabella Temple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| The point of that is to get feedback from the community, provide updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| But this is just the start, not the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| But that change from spring to winter is driving this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| and adding quite a bit of stress to Mr. Clabo and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| And it's fair to say that winning this grant alone will not be enough money to do something like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| No, it's a piece of the puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| Obviously, this type of project and infrastructure is beyond just a mid-sized local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| So that's why we need that partnership with the state, with the federal government, with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| with both the UT system and the UT campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| It requires that type of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| And obviously the partnership with the community and Ms. Toker and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| And so it's not a single-person team here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| It's an entire team of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| I just want to reinforce what we've all said, but just clearly that I've lived in cities with pedestrian bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| They're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| I think the how it enters a community that exists now will be the most important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and the best way to do that is to hear from the public that lives there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| So I'm grateful for your commitment to the February 13th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| and I hope everybody in South Knoxville and everybody that cares about that waterfront will come to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| I just wanted to comment that I've been on my fair share of pedestrian bridges as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| and the bridge is the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| You've got to make sure it's structurally sound, and if it can be a beautiful design, that's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| But where and how it lands on either side of the river is really important to its success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4464)|
| 1:14:31| If it's a bridge to nowhere or if it's a bridge to, like, a surface parking lot, it's not going to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| There's a pedestrian bridge in Nashville, and it lands into the surface parking lot of the Titan Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| and, you know, it's empty most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| And so we don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| We can learn from the successes and less successful projects that have happened across the state and around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4486)|
| 1:14:56| And so we've had 20 years to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| and now we need to freshen up that thinking both at a local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| and be inspired by what we can learn from other communities around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| Yes, you led right into the question that I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| At this stage, do we have a rigid point-to-point connection from one side of the river to the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4511)|
| 1:15:22| Is something kind of considered the most viable, or is it flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| just if you would address kind of exactly where this bridge may be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| So the actual vision plan called for it to be in a pretty specific location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| and so the vision plan calls for it to cross down, if you think of where Thompson Bowling is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| over to just downriver of Ready Mix, if you know where the Ready Mix site is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| And then actually with the Tiger grant, the city and its partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| again, that was another partnership with the University of Tennessee, with Knox County, and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| there was a NEPA process and document completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| So we have very firm boundaries if we want to use federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| So it is very clear where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| It was where the community ultimately decided it should be in the vision plan, and then the NEPA document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| If we were going to change locations, that NEPA process would start over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| and that is a pretty timely process that I think engineering could elaborate on the difficulties of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| But the partnership now and the vision plan call for it to cross there at Thompson Bowling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| over towards Ready Mix and some of the industrial property on the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| That's a very good clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And I'll just add, you know, it's a no-brainer that the community shouldn't be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| I would be aghast if they weren't involved in some of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| So I'm quite confident that that's going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| But I'll wait and see at the end to see if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Council Member Parker, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| Yes, I have a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| I mean, first thing that came to mind when listening to the description of this project is a pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4627)|
| 1:17:17| to Scottish Pike is absolutely a bridge to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| So I'm very confused about this project overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| And my apologies to the residents of Scottish Pike, but I think you all would agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| I don't think you would want a whole bunch of people just dumped into your neighborhood without a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4648)|
| 1:17:36| I can't imagine Sequoia Hills would want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| You know, no neighborhood would want that without a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| $150,000 for a grant proposal is a grant proposal that the community hasn't discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4664)|
| 1:17:55| Another horrible waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| When we have these funding opportunities before us like the Tiger Grant, it's not just one project in Knoxville that would qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4678)|
| 1:18:08| We have other projects that could be moved forward that could, you know, have some grant funding applied to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4688)|
| 1:18:16| It doesn't have to be this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| I don't know why there's a focus on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| It's similar to the baseball stadium for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| It's just a dumb idea, and it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| Now, if we discuss it as a community more thoroughly, maybe we can see some possibilities from this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4708)|
| 1:18:37| But currently, it's a horrible idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| I don't understand the public benefit to the city at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| I see the benefit to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| It expands their housing options, but I don't think it solves our problem as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4727)|
| 1:18:55| I think students will still drive from Scottish Pike to UT campus, even with a pedestrian bridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4735)|
| 1:19:03| So I think more discussion needs to be made, needs to be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| When I spoke with the administration, I thought that the grant applied for in 2015 went forward, and that was money that we'd already wasted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4749)|
| 1:19:20| But it seems like we didn't waste that money in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| I wanted to clarify that piece of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| Mr. Brace, or Ms. Gill, or maybe Mr. Clabo, about the 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| I was not super familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Mr. Parker, I wanted to make sure I understood your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| But there are two grants that we've applied for in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| The first we received, and that is what supported the NEPA documentation that was referenced earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| That was a smaller grant to the tune of, I think, $500,000 or $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| Then there was a second application for the TIGER grant in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| That was not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Okay, so I think I'm speaking about that first one, because I think it was $600,000 with an almost $200,000 match from the city, something around that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4795)|
| 1:20:04| Yeah, that's what we used to complete the NEPA document and the preliminary conceptual design for this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| I mean, for me, it's one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| If you do not have any other funding priorities, this could be a cool thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| But we have other funding priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| We are a different city than we were in 2000 when this was discussed, in 2006 when this was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4825)|
| 1:20:32| We need to have a discussion for our current reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| And our current reality is that we need much different infrastructure than this pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| And I would like to see the city pursue funding opportunities like the TIGER grant for priorities that have already been identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4843)|
| 1:20:54| We have road projects that have already been identified that need funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4854)|
| 1:21:02| We don't need to drudge up, you know, kind of wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| This is described to us as a wish list idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| This is not the time to move forward on funding wish list ideas when we have serious immediate needs in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4872)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Today when I was speaking with Deputy Gil, the first thing that came across my mind was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| last night I had gone through driving around the third district with the chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| and a lot of the roads I was able to point out there's been a car accident here, this has happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| We need a lot more funding in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| So this is something, it does feel like a wish list idea, but I think it's also been in the making for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4907)|
| 1:21:55| But I'm just here to remind you, the third district really needs some more funding for the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Director Evans, in reviewing this project, is the pedestrian and bicycle bridge for the south waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4925)|
| 1:22:13| is that in the capital improvement plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| It is not in there for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| As Mr. Brace and Ms. Gil mentioned, there's some money, old capital money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| a little bit left over from what we previously did for the south waterfront pedestrian bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| In fact, I did the procurement on it to get a concept, vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| But what's going to happen is, assuming if you all do vote to proceed with these services, these grant writing services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4962)|
| 1:22:51| what's going to happen is we're going to come to you with a budget amendment either at the next council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| or the one after that that takes some of that old money, a little bit of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| and also some from south waterfront infrastructure to make up the whole $150,000 so that you have it for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4981)|
| 1:23:13| So there won't be any loss to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| It's money that's sitting there and we're not going to be using it anyway, not as it was intended back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=4997)|
| 1:23:27| So there's $150,000 in old capital funds that were assigned to this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5007)|
| 1:23:37| which you're going to bring a budget amendment to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| We're going to come and so we can pay for the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| So, Vice Mayor, I think it's not going to require any additional funds, just reallocating from one thing to another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| That's correct. It's a project to another type of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| It's not a capital project, a grant writing thing, something that we would capitalize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| And then, Director Swanson, just to make sure, hearing all that, is it proper for council to vote on this this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5043)|
| 1:24:13| Yes, it is, because you're not voting on a capital project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| You're voting on professional services and technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| If, for example, you were voting on soil testing and all those kinds of things in preparation for building a bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| that would be a capital improvement project and you'd have to have that in the capital budget before you voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| But this is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| So until we get to that point, until funds are available to devote to that, you don't need to have your capital improvement budget amended to include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5076)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Ultimately, I think the discussion we've had tonight about the need for public participation and input I think has been really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5087)|
| 1:24:57| That's definitely something we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| I think, as the mayor mentioned, where it lands and how that land is purposed around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5100)|
| 1:25:09| all those things make a big difference on whether this is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| And having that public input is critical to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| The other piece of this that I just wanted to highlight is the partnership that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| having UT and the county and potentially federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| I mean, this is a lot of money that we're spending to have a grant right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| but when I think about the overall cost of this project and then also the benefits of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5130)|
| 1:25:39| this will have some benefits for the city, but it will also have a lot of benefits for UT and for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| And if we can bring in some federal dollars, I think that's good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| making sure that it's not just local dollars that are being used to fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| So I appreciate the answers. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Council members, for sure, Vice Mayor, we definitely cannot do this without federal and state support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| It's way too big a project to do with local dollars only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| Did you have any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| I just wanted to add that we can do big things in Knoxville, and we can do many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| And as you all know, this council is supporting many projects and many investments in affordable housing and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| Transforming Western was a $40 million grant that was awarded to revitalizing the Western Heights and Beaumont community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| We've applied for the Reconnecting Communities grant surrounding Morningside and Austin, First Creek at Austin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5192)|
| 1:26:40| over into East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| We're creating the multiuse stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| We're making investments in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| We are doing many things, and this pedestrian bridge is a vision that has been part of this community for more than two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| It just so happens that the stars may be aligned as far as the partnerships and collaboration between here in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| county, UT, private sector, and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| And the federal government has passed legislation that has invested a billion, I don't know, a lot of money in infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5227)|
| 1:27:16| And Knoxville deserves a slice of that pie for all the infrastructure needs we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| including revitalizing communities like Western Heights and a pedestrian bridge that this community has been interested in pursuing for two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| So I appreciate the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| I pledge that we will, if this is approved, be able to solicit great public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| because the project will be more successful if we hear from the people that live and work and are going to be using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| So thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5263)|

| 1:29:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| The chief maybe talked to us a little bit about the additional cameras and what we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| I was particularly interested in how this is related to how recruitment's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| Chief Noel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| So while recruitment's going great, you know, this really has a lot to do with the reorganization of the department, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| So we reorganized the department, so we took some officers who traditionally were not in uniform on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| so we have more officers on the street, which caused us to require more body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Also, we had some officers that because of their duties were not wearing body cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| and we now have those officers wearing body cameras, so that required us to, you know, add body cameras in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| We have 22 recruits that will be graduating from the academy on early February, so we'll need more cameras for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| We're going to do everything we can to run three academy classes this year as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| so we definitely need more body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5439)|

| 1:32:21| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5541)|

| 1:32:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knox City Code, Chapter 5, to establish additional minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5555)|
| 1:32:40| requirements for the care and keeping of animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5560)|

| 1:32:48| Mayor, if I could make a procedural motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| Vice Mayor, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I'd like to make a motion to amend our rules this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Item 12B and 12C are significantly related and intertwined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| I make a motion that we amend our rules and consider both 12B and 12C at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| This would mean that the speakers in favor of either item could speak in support of that item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| during the public comment phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Since they're so interrelated, we can then have a discussion about what's going on in each of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| each of these different ordinance proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| We'll have to vote on them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| But I think one thing this prevents is we may have a number of speakers who are speaking for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| and they might be speaking against another when what we really want to hear is why people are for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| and for another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| So that would be my motion that we amend the rules to do that or suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| I've been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| I have to make a motion to suspend the rules to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Vice Member Baird has made a motion to suspend the rules to consider both items 12B and 12C at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5633)|
| 1:34:01| The motion has been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Ms. Fuca, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| My question is then do we do our regular rules of three, four, three against apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| That was my next amendment motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Well, I don't know whether I'm forward or not on whether I know what we're doing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| I'm not sure how many people have signed up, but I know this is a very important topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| and we're going to have a lot of people who want to give us input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| My suggestion for that would be that we allow those who have signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| but we limit the speaking to less than three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| So that would be my second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| So the first motion is to suspend the rules to consider item 12B and 12C at the same time in our discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| and that's what the motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| Any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| That motion to suspend the rules along those lines passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| I would make a motion that we allow anyone who's signed up to speak on these items to have up to three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5707)|
| 1:35:15| and that way we can hear from everybody because I know this is an important topic that very many folks want to speak to us about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5715)|
| 1:35:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5725)|
| 1:35:26| Vice Mayor Roberto makes a motion to suspend the rules to allow all the people who signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| and to suspend the rule that they could speak up to three minutes instead of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| Questions about this motion to suspend the rules in that fashion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| How are we going to clarify when people signed up for or against on one or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| Is there some clarity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Mr. Johnson has like a whole matrix here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| He has a matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| We'll do the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| We want to hear from everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| I think it seems like Council wants to hear from everybody who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| I think the only challenging part would be if somebody had signed up and they maybe weren't speaking for any one proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5769)|
| 1:36:18| That might present a challenge, but I think everyone who signed up should get a chance to have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| The last second of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| It looks like it's about maybe 12 to 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Council Member Parker, question on the amendment proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| How many people signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Well, like several people signed up for both items, so they would speak once instead of twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5805)|
| 1:36:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| That's, I think, part of the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| But still 12 to 15 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Well, it looks like Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| So for 12B in favor, I have four signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| For 12B in opposition, I have 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| For 12C, I have four signed up to speak in favor, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| But many of those are the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Any other questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| Vice Mayor Roberto, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| So all those in favor of the amendment as Vice Mayor Roberto described, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| The motion to amend the rules for these two items passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| So we'll start with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5869)|

| 1:37:53| Could we take five minutes before all the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Let's take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Should we reduce ourselves to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Let's reconvene at 745.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| We'll reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| And I'm missing your lights on, but we're going to do public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| It's regarding public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| There is somebody, 10-year-old Mabry has just signed on, and I'm hoping that my colleagues are okay if she has three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5894)|
| 1:38:22| Make a motion to add somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| Make a motion to add Mabry for three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| There's a motion made to add Mabry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| So, Mayor, I will second only because Mabry is 10 years old and just added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| I wouldn't want us to make this a habit to add people onto public forum, suspending those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Mabry, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| Not yet, but you're on the list wherever you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| We'll begin with Ellen Pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Forgive me if I'm mispronouncing your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Ellen Pack, P-A-C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| If you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record, and you will have up to three minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5951)|
| 1:39:19| I'm Ellen Pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| I live at 1304 Beeman Lake Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| And really speak closely into the microphone so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Ellen Pack, 1304 Beeman Lake Road, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5966)|
| 1:39:34| I've been an animal control officer and involved in animal welfare for over 10-plus years in Baltimore City, Maryland, Baltimore County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5974)|
| 1:39:43| Hartford County, Maryland, Charleston, South Carolina, and also here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| Currently, I am the Director of Outreach for the Pets for Life Program at Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| And in my work there, we go door to door in a specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=5996)|
| 1:40:04| We researched the city of Knoxville, the whole county, and came up with an area not due to income-based needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6004)|
| 1:40:15| That was a little bit of it, but mostly resources in that area, where our highest intakes came from, from animal control, where calls were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6015)|
| 1:40:24| just to see where there would be an amount of people who could possibly use our help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| So literally block by block, door to door, we go to these people's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6032)|
| 1:40:38| We make friends in the community, and we supply whatever their need might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| Transportation to spay-neuter programs, shots, microchips, dog houses, everything that you can possibly think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6045)|
| 1:40:58| Also included in this is tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| We give trolleys so that dogs are not on a fixed-point tie-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| So many people, they have fences, but maybe their fences are broken, or they've got more than one animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| They can't let both of them outside at the same time, so they'll tie them in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| Nobody likes to see animals tied up, but what you don't know is that so many of those animals are coming inside when it gets cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6080)|
| 1:41:30| And they do have people to play with them and love them and care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| And a ban to take all this away is going to hurt so many pet owners, people that physically cannot walk their dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6095)|
| 1:41:46| This is their only means of getting it out to get some exercise, fresh air, and go potty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| We just ask you to really have some perspective on this and say that it's not always as it appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6113)|
| 1:42:00| and that we are trying to reach people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| We can't do it quick, but we are out there trying to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| And I know all these other groups are as well, and I hope we can all work together to make this better for pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6128)|
| 1:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Next person signed up to speak is Richard Merritt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| Mr. Merritt, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6143)|
| 1:42:35| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| If you could state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Richard Merritt, 2216 Hawkins Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6159)|
| 1:42:47| Hello, pet lovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| I am a pet owner, and I have dogs that are leashed outside, but they have an 8- to 10-foot chain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6171)|
| 1:43:01| and they have toys, and they're provided with food and water, and they're happy outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6181)|
| 1:43:12| I don't really agree with dogs being locked up inside all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| I think it's going to be hard to do because people have to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| The dogs that aren't used to it, they're going to not know what to do inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| They're going to chew up little girls' toys and, you know, just do stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| The dogs that aren't used to it, I just don't think it's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| Thank goodness for Pets for Life because those people do wonders for people that do have pets that need help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6218)|
| 1:43:46| and sometime I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| I just think that, you know, my dogs need me and I need my dogs, and I just don't want to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6230)|
| 1:44:03| Some dogs are going to chew stuff in your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| I mean, they're just not going to know, and it's just going to be really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| And if you love your pets, I mean, I know that they're not stuck outside because you don't love them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| It's just that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| It's just hard for people to keep them inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| and I'm afraid some people come home and they're going to get mad because of what the dog did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| and maybe, you know, yell at the dog or hit the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| You know, it just bothers me that something like this would happen, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6276)|
| 1:44:44| It just doesn't seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6284)|
| 1:44:54| I just think, I don't know, it's just hard for me to understand how it would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| if you had to leave your dogs inside all the time and you just had 20 minutes to take them outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| and you had to stand out there with them for 20 minutes and then bring them back in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| I don't see how they're going to get enough exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| unless you have time to take them for a walk around the block every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| But like I said, I don't want to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| My dogs love me and I love my pets, and they're well taken care of, and I bring them in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| If it gets down below 35, I bring my dogs in the house at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| And that Arctic freeze we had, I had dogs in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| I had three dogs in the house and one small one for like four days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| and they'd go out every four or five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| I'd take them out and walk them and let them use the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| But something like that, I can understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Okay, just thank you all for pet lovers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Next person is Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6358)|
| 1:46:09| Patrick Birmingham, 284 Sanders West Boulevard, Maxwell, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| As the board chair for Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| I wanted to come and kind of speak on behalf of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| We're obviously the municipal shelter for both the city of Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| and we're charged with sheltering and helping the community stray and lost animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| And our intake is over 10,000 animals a year in terms of what we're intaking into Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6396)|
| 1:46:43| But beyond that, our mission is to find a loving home for every pet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| advance animal welfare, and educate the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| In order to improve the overall welfare of pets in the community, education is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| And that's why we support raising the standards of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| particularly those that are contained in the Ordinance 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| A ban on tethering sounds like a good concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| but it would disproportionately affect the lower-income families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| and does not really keep pets any safer, healthier, or happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| Rather than punish the pet owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Young-Williams is committed to working with pet owners to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| and improve the animal's long-term well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| And a ban on unattended tethering would have the opposite effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| and very likely result in more homeless animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| Our preference is to implement a humane standards of tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| and allow us to educate pet owners about trolley tethers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6456)|

| 1:47:46| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6466)|

| 1:47:50| Next person is Jesse Ellison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6470)|
| 1:48:03| Hello, I'm Jesse Ellison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| I'm the Director of Outbound Operations at Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| I've been in animal welfare for close to 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| did a seven-year stint in animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| and I don't agree at all with a ban on unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| The repercussions from telling someone they can't keep their pet on a tether outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| will lead them to find other solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| This would include letting dogs run loose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| putting them in an area they can easily escape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| or moving them to a work space like an enclosed shed or a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| without fresh air and sunlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| The image of a pet on a tether is emotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| and it negatively impacts people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| It's okay that they see an animal on a 10-by-10 kennel, and that may seem better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| When you figure that up, that's less than 100 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| In that 100 square foot, the animal goes to the bathroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| eats, and doesn't get no room for exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| whereas a 10-foot trolley line offers double that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Low-income pet owners will be adversely impacted the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| and as an ex-animal control officer, I've seen firsthand experience with these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| More than 50% of people rent their homes in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| They can't afford to build a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| and even if they had permission from the landlord, it would be restricted by funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| The pets are better off with their humans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| and we would have a better opportunity for Young Webb's Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| and or Animal Control to work with and educate these pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| In cases where an animal is taken to the shelter for abuse or neglect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| a low number are actually related to tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| The issues are more likely to be related to low standards of animal care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| such as lack of adequate and dry shelter, food, and fresh water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| Tethering is not the problem that needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| The standards of animal care that we can legally enforce need to be elevated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| Thank you for allowing me to speak on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| I've seen firsthand as an animal control officer and a director at the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| what repercussions can be from no tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Mr. Elson, before you leave, if you could just state your address, work address or home address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6595)|

| 1:50:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Next up is Kyle Lang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| If you could state your name and address for the record, you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| Kyle Lang, 1509 Chicago Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| I am here to speak on behalf of the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance and Chain Free Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| The care standards under consideration in Agenda Items 12B and 12C are the work of many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| and we want to thank everyone who put their time and effort into these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| It is clear that we all agree that increased standards for concerns such as shelter, water and nutrition are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| and that these important changes provide clarity to our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| as well as more enforceable regulations for our animal control officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| The key difference between the two ordinances under consideration this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| is the language contained in Section 11, Part C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| The version in Item 12B requires dogs be attached to a trolley system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| but allows for continuous tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| The other version in Item 12C allows either fixed point or trolley tethering while supervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| This is the version supported by KAWA and is the language proven by other communities across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| to be the most effective means to combat continuous tethering, increase public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| and provide clear and enforceable guidance for citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| Throughout this revision process, we have considered the impact to pet owners of various socioeconomic statuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| as well as the importance of education and available resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| As proposed, there is a six-month transition period plus two 30-day grace periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| in effect providing eight months to come into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| during which period we can continue the educational efforts already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| through programs such as Pets for Life, information shared by our animal control officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| and through organizations such as Chain Free Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| Not only is Chain Free Knoxville knocking on doors and engaging in important conversations about pet care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| with residents on an almost daily basis, but we also provide financial resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| through free fencing, training sessions, shelter and other basic pet care needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| But all the educational and financial resources in the world won't affect real and lasting change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| without complementary legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| There is no reason to believe that persons of a certain socioeconomic status are unable to comply with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| or that they should be held to a lesser standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| And in fact, this is not representative of how we manage legislation in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| For example, do we disregard speed limits or lower billing code standards for people in certain neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| Responsible pet ownership, humane treatment of animals and public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| should span all socioeconomic statuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| This is not about punitive or targeted legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| nor is it about just the dogs that are currently continuously tethered in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| This is about establishing clear and enforceable standards for responsible pet ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| that our citizens understand and consider prior to bringing a dog into their lives in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| This is about public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| This is about being a city of excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| And this is about a long overdue change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| As elected officials, I trust you will represent your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| and their overwhelming support that you have received on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| and vote no to item 12B and yes to item 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6779)|

| 1:53:28| I am in full support of an unsupervised tethering ban in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| and so are the members of the KVMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| A recent survey was sent out to the veterinarian members of the KVMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| on the proposed language changes to the city animal code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| in regards to an unsupervised tethering ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| Responses to the survey were gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| and of those 78% agreed with the language of supporting an unsupervised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| tether ban in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| As advocates for animal care and experts on animal welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| it speaks volumes that the veterinarians of our city approve of this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| and want permanent unsupervised tethering of dogs to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| While I can speak to the multiple benefits of removing dogs off their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| unsupervised chains, I want to speak to the newest proposed language of using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| a pulley system instead of an unsupervised tethering ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| There are many reasons why trolley and pulley lines are not a sufficient solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| to the problem of continuous tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| Not only are they dangerous, as manufacturers recommend to never use unsupervised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| as dogs can easily become entangled, hang themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| and trap a leg and get it strangulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| They also do not provide any substantive improvement in quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| They do not protect the dog from aggressive wildlife and roaming dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| which can result in death and unwanted litters or dog fights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| or protect people from accidentally roaming too close to an unsocialized dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| which can result in dog bites and attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| Trading a chain for a pulley system is not helping the dogs or people of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| I have personally seen the harm that an unsupervised chain or tether has done to a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| Embedded collars, chains that have caused infection and cuts into the skin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| raw and open wounds have all been seen in these dogs that are kept tethered unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| The skin trauma, the chronic rubbing, and the severe pain these dogs are in cannot be overstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| It can take weeks to get these wounds to heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| It is cruel to keep dogs unsupervised on any sort of chain, tether, collie, and pulley system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| as dogs are at high risk of harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| The length of time a dog has remained unsupervised on a tether or chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| only increases the risk to the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| It is not only inhumane to the animal to have an unsupervised tether or a pulley system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| as I've stated above, but it also harms our community and our shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| I hope you will see that Knoxville should enact an unsupervised tethering ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| regardless if on a chain or a pulley system in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| so we can really live up to the moniker we were given in 2011 by Dog Fancy magazine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| as the most dog-friendly city in the Southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| I thank you so much for your time and this important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| The next speaker is Jana Cecil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Jana Cecil, if you could come up to the podium, state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| I'm Jana Cecil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| I live at 10917 Sandstone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| I'm speaking tonight in support of the full ban on the unsupervised tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| and I'm not in support of a ban only on fixed point tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| while still allowing continuous tethering on a trolley system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| I'm a co-founder of Chain Free Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| a volunteer-led nonprofit formed as one part of the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6992)|
| 1:56:36| to eliminate 24-7 chaining of dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Chain Free Knoxville volunteers are engaged in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| We have knocked on doors and spoken with well over a hundred owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| of continuously chained dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Our approach is nonjudgmental and respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| We don't ask them to relinquish their dog or question their decision to chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| We simply offer them something better, a generous-sized fencing enclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| a shade canopy inside it, a doghouse maybe if they need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| an elevated cot, and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| We arrange spay and neuter services for them and transport if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| We refer them to other resources such as the pet food pantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| And after the fence is built, we continue to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| We go back if there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| We deliver straw for the winter, and we deliver fly traps and ointment for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| We have flexibility in our program to meet our mission in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| Three owners this past year asked us to rehome their dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| We placed all three with rescues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| We have a professional dog trainer who donates an hour training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| and education to any fence recipients who would like help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| And we gladly provide training instead of a fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| if an owner actually prefers to bring their dog inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| We've recently had our very first success with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| We understand there's a concern over the effect an unsupervised tethering ban may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| on economically disadvantaged dog owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| Based upon my work with chain dog owners in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| I believe that some will have the resources to comply with the ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| or will end up bringing their dogs indoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| In fact, only one of the 43 households that received a fence from Chain Free Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| cited that the reason their dog was continuously tethered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| was because they did not have the funds for a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| But for those that don't, we are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| and I want to assure you that Chain Free Knoxville has the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| and the support needed to carry out this very important role in the transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| And once the ban is passed, we will give priority to applications from city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7107)|
| 1:58:32| We have enormous support in Knoxville and across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| because the reality is that people do not want to see dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| living solitary lives at the end of a tether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| whether that tether is a fixed-point chain or a trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| We are confident in our ability to raise whatever funds are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| to build fences for Knoxville's residents who qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| and we have offered to collaborate with animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| to develop an information packet of options for other chain dog owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| The services provided by organizations like Chain Free Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| provide a temporary solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| but ultimately Chain Free Knoxville wants to no longer be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| and the only way to do that is to prevent more dogs from ending up at the end of a tether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7147)|
| 1:59:12| If ever a city was prepared and ready for a tethering ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| it is Knoxville and it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| Please don't let this opportunity to be an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| and a model city to other Tennessee cities pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| The next speaker is Jason Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| Mr. Bradley, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| Jason Bradley, 1854 Prospect Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| and I'm speaking in favor of a ban on unsupervised dog tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| I started my work in the dog advocacy and rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| about 18 years ago in Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| They gave me the tools I needed to learn how to care for a dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| and the responsibilities I needed to do to foster for dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| Since then, I've spent that time working with rescues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| in order to make sure that these dogs have the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| that they need from bad positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| A lot of our dogs come from litters of untethered animals or tethered animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| These dogs don't have the means to protect themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| and the rescues unfortunately get the job of having to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| with these unwanted litters of puppies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| Otherwise, the owners would have to dispose of the dogs in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| These rescues are in favor of an unsupervised tethering ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| because unless you can supervise your dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7233)|
| 2:00:37| you do not know what elements may be coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| when the dog is not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| When I've lived in other cities that have enacted a tethering ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| what we found was that these cities had better neighborhoods for dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| because tethered dogs made more noise, tended to be more aggressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| when they got loose, and presented a nuisance for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| My last city of Dayton, Ohio, enacted a tethering ban in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| and the public response was so positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| they added more provisions to strengthen that in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| I think Knoxville can do better, and I think we can do it in one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| I think in my neighborhood of the Morningside community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| we love our dogs like all of our neighbors do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| and this city is fantastic for dogs, but we could be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| We could provide these dogs the protection they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| and give the rescues the break they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| so we can serve more dogs and keep more dogs safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| So please consider a ban on unsupervised tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| so we can keep the dogs in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| like my neighborhood in Morningside safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| Next speaker is Julia Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Ms. Roy, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| Julia Roy, 1125 Montview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| I am a co-founder of Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| and Chain Free Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| My profession is in health care as a nurse practitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| and for that reason, I have a vested interest and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| to ensure the safety of people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| I do not support a ban on fixed-point tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| and implementing a trolley-only policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| I do support supervised tethering only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| due to the unintended consequences of dog attacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7350)|
| 2:02:33| and dog bites that occur at a higher rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| with unsupervised tethered dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| The CDC states that a chained dog is 2.8 times more likely to bite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| than an unchained dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| and dogs most likely to attack are male, unneutered, and chained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| I can attest that 43% of the 63 dogs we have helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7369)|

| 2:03:21| Based upon feedback from people who use trolley systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| for their dogs, they tend to fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| leading to dogs getting loose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| which could result in more unsocialized dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7408)|

| 2:03:39| I know I've thrown out a lot of statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| and you may be wondering how this impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| our community directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7423)|

| 2:03:53| In addition, the PETA database of chained dog attacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| does mention the following bite incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| over a 12-year time span that occurred in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| A 13-year-old girl was attacked by two dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| who had gotten loose from their tethers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| while she was walking to her school bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| An 11-year-old girl was playing on a relative's deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| when the relative's dog kept on a chain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| bit her two to three times on her left leg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7453)|

| 2:04:34| In summary, permitting dogs on trolley systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| unsupervised does not decrease the bite risk of the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| or make our community any safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| We have to ask ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| if continuous unsupervised tethering is both cruel to the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| and dangerous to humans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| why will we continue to allow this practice in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7493)|

| 2:05:12| I'm here to speak in favor of Ordinance 12C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| which bans the unsupervised tethering of animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| As many of you know, I've been the general manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| at the Crowne Plaza here in town for the past 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| And I can tell you that as one of the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| if not the first pet-friendly hotels in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| being kind to people's animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| and making sure they're well taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| is very, very good for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| And I feel strongly that the passage of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| will send that message not only to the community at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| but to communities around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| and make Knoxville a much more attractive city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| for animal organizations looking for locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| to bring their events, their visitors, and their tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| On a more personal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| I can tell you that I have been an animal owner my entire life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| and those animals have come in all shapes and sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| Tammy and I are currently being trained by a miniature dachshund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| and a French bulldog that we love very, very deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| And if I know one thing about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| as well as the other animals that I've owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| and thousands and thousands of other animals here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| is they are completely incapable of protecting themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| from all that the world might throw in their face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| if left unprotected and unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7585)|

| 2:06:35| Mr. Dyke, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| You'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7598)|

| 2:06:45| I'm here today to talk to you about the dangers of the trolley system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| and why they should never be used unattended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Trolley systems are considered dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| because it is easy for them to break, causing the dog to escape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| And it is easy for the dog to get tangled, causing injury or even death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| A quick review of manufacturer instructions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| for multiple top-selling trolley systems states the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| I've got an example here. It's about $30 at Walmart, 50-foot tether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| You read the bottom line. It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| We recommend never leaving your dog unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| That trend continues. You look at the top ones on Amazon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| You get things like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| It is recommended that you observe how your pet behaves on the track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| for some time before leaving your pet unattended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| which we do not recommend under any system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| due to the unpredictability and behavior of your pet and unproceded factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| Things like, not all dogs can be tethered effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| Owner supervision and judgment are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| So you go on. You look at, like, the reviews of things on Amazon and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| You get statements like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| Please, if you love your pet, do not buy this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| I bought this back in December, and only three months later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| the lead broke and my dog got loose and is still missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| I have no idea where he is, if he is okay, alive or dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| All I know is I trusted this product to keep my beloved pet in his yard and keep him safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| but the product failed, and now my dog is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| I am totally heartbroken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Another testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| After only one week of use as a run line for my 60-pound dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| the properly installed cable had stretched and sagged, making it unusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| My dog somehow managed to wrap the nylon bungee around his neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| Despite the 360-degree swivel clasp, which had caught in his fur and failed to swivel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| Thankfully, I managed to save him before he strangled to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| One last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| My dog was left outside on one of these runners for a few hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| and I came home to her having died from hanging herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| She chewed the cable connecting to the runner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| and had it frayed and bunched up and got around her neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| Do not, I repeat, do not put your dog on one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| These sorts of reviews are not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| They're kind of ubiquitous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| It's obvious that this is not a safe product for any owner to utilize on their dog unsupervised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| nor is it recommended by the manufacturer to be used without the owner present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| We should not be requiring our citizens to use products in a manner that is contrary to manufacturer directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| and which are proven to be dangerous to the dogs and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7751)|

| 2:09:38| Over the last year and a half, the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance has surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| and polled dozens of animal control offices in cities with various tethering regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| It is clear from their responses that the only effective solution to continuous chaining of dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| is a full ban on unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| Asheville, North Carolina, implemented such a ban in 2009, and it has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7797)|
| 2:10:05| Sue McMullen, the animal services supervisor in the city of Asheville, was unable to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| but she asked us to read her statement in support of an unsupervised tethering ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| Greetings, city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Most municipalities have anti-cruelty laws, but they do not effectively address problems of tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| Unfortunately, it is difficult and time-consuming for animal control officers to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| that animal abuse is occurring where tethering is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| All over the country, concerned citizens call their local police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| or animal control officer every day to report chained dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Officers may investigate the situation, but often it's hard to prove a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| hence they are unable to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| This not only wastes municipal resources, it frustrates and angers citizens worried about the animal's welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| Animal control divisions don't have the resources to watch a single house for 24 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| to determine how long a dog is actually being tethered and whether he is given fresh food and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7860)|
| 2:11:05| A law that makes tethering illegal allows officers to quickly respond and take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| The city of Asheville adopted a tethering ordinance on September 22, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| While anti-tethering laws may inconvenience a few people, the benefits outweigh the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| Unsupervised tethering, to include the use of trolley cable systems also, is a public safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7880)|
| 2:11:28| There is no public benefit to unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Public safety should always win out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Respectively, Sue D. McMullen, Animal Services Supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| There are many other animal control offices that enforce and support a ban like Asheville's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7898)|
| 2:11:44| Please consider Ms. McMullen's statement and add Knoxville to the growing list of communities with unsupervised tethering bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7904)|
| 2:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7911)|

| 2:12:11| I'm a certified dog trainer and dog behavior consultant for over 15 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7931)|
| 2:12:16| I have worked with various shelters and rescue groups throughout the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| and was the lead trainer for five years in Southern California for Petco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| My background includes working with shy, fearful, and aggressive dogs from tethers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7944)|
| 2:12:29| I'm listed with the Knoxville Animal Control Division to conduct the canine good citizen training and test for dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| I have also worked with the Humane Society of Tennessee Valley as a dog trainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| I own and operate the Canine Clubhouse Dog Training Company since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7960)|
| 2:12:45| I would like to speak about my professional experience with dogs on outside tether systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7965)|
| 2:12:50| My clients had a dog they tethered outside signing up for group class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| I noticed that the dog was always very stressed coming to class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| and it affected the learning for the dog and every other dog in the group class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7977)|
| 2:13:01| Upon asking many different questions and changing the group location to my training facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| I found out that the dog has displayed aggressive behavior on several occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| while trying to put the harness on to come to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| The reason for this was because she was tethered unsupervised outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| and had injured her back leg while on the tether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| The owners went to the veterinarian to get her examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| Due to the owners tethering her outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| she associated the owners approaching with the harness the same way as when they approached her with the tether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| which resulted in her displaying aggressive behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| She became fearful being tethered unsupervised, so her owner was unable to prevent harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| If she had been supervised, she would not have gotten tangled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| Dogs learn by association and do not know the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| if you approach them with an outside tether or a harness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| This behavior cannot be corrected until the trust is restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| I worked with many clients in their tethering dogs in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| and I have come to learn that dogs that are left unattended outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| will face a lot of challenges, including being exposed to freezing or hot temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| wild animal attacks, attacks, rapes from loose dogs, being unsocial, sometimes aggressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| being exposed to children in a frustrating way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| and they do not get the proper care mentally, physically, or socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| Remember, dogs learn by association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Dogs are social animals and should be treated and cared for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| in ways that benefit the owners and the dog's bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8071)|

| 2:14:40| You have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8080)|
| 2:14:41| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| My name is Amber Noble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8082)|

| 2:14:49| I am speaking in favor of Agenda Item 12C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| a ban on the unsupervised tethering of dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| My dog, Bernice, is a sweet, fun, happy dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| My dog, Bernice, is a sweet, fun, happy 60-pound Labrador| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| who was attacked in our own fenced-in backyard this past March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| by two dogs who are much bigger than she,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| and they had broken off their tethers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| I do have a photo of the dogs who attacked her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| because they came back several hours after attacking her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| In the photo, both dogs are wearing collars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| from which their tethers can clearly be seen hanging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| Through the help of some neighbors who recognize the dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| I was able to locate the home of at least one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| I have driven by the home multiple times since the attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| the next day, later that week, later that month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| and several times later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| Each time I have driven by, I have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| and a couple of times I've been able to snap photos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| of the same female dog who attacked my dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| unsupervised and tethered to a pulley in her backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| I did not blame the dogs then, and I do not blame them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| I do, however, blame the irresponsibility of their owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8151)|
| 2:15:54| for not caring for their dogs properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| I am thankful Bernice was able to defend herself this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| and a helpful neighbor was able to distract the dogs by yelling at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| Thankfully, my girl is still happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| She's extremely loving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| However, she does now have a tendency to be somewhat distrusting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| and a bit territorial at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| because she was attacked in her own backyard, completely unprovoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| Bernice is my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| She is one of my children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| and I cannot imagine chaining her outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| and leaving her out there day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| If people cannot properly care for their pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| they simply shouldn't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| Unsupervised tethering of dogs is highly irresponsible and inhumane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| Next speaker is Malia Hipsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| Ms. Hipsky, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| set your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| Hi, my name's Malia Hipsky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| and I live at 5940 Hickory Valley Road in Andersonville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| and you may be asking why I'm here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| I'm speaking on behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| I am the president and founder of Slumdog Rescue in Anderson County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| I represent an all-breed nonprofit canine rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| that's dedicated to the dogs that need us the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| We pull the majority of our dogs from Anderson County Animal Shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| and work closely with the shelter to allow a better life for these dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| This is why I'm here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| to speak for those who don't have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230110?start=8254)|
