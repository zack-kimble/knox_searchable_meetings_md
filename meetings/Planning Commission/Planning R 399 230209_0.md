| 0:10:02| Mr. Chair, we make a motion to approve the consent items as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| All right, we have a motion from Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=609)|

| 0:10:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| First item on the agenda is item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| There will be, let's see here, we've got, this will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=621)|
| 0:10:32| We'll wait as Commissioner Huber exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Item number six, the applicant is Huber Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Location, east side of Helm Bolk Road, west side of Francis Road, south of Amherst Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| Approximate size of the tract, 16.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Present zoning is ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Zoning requested, RN2, single family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Staff recommendation, approve RN2, which is single family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| zoning because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Mr. King, would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Would opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| Thank you so very much for allowing me the opportunity to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| I first wanted to ask, we did submit a request letter for postponing this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| I assume that that was not entertained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| That letter was sent on February 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Ma'am, just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| I'm here to state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| It's Teresa Ledbetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| I live with my husband, Ron, at 6316 Creekhead Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| I have been in that community for over 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| and I am here representing the Amherst-Helmholt Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| which is a group we refer to the name as ACCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| We have over 500 residents within our boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=745)|
| 0:12:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Do you want me to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I understand that the staff is recommending approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| We would like to be able to go on record reflecting that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| this particular association, is opposed to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| However, because the RN zoning is really not compatible with the existing landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| 236 residents are currently zoned Ag and RN-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| There are only 62 residents that are zoned RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and I'll address those two in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| There is, in fact, one RN-3, which are condos that were built in the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| There have been no new developments that have sprung up in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| Two properties that are cited in the report, in the staff report, are not new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=805)|
| 0:13:32| but those two properties are Amherst Woods, which has 31 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| It's northeast of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| It's actually across the railroad tracks on the other side of Amherst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| and that was built in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| The second subdivision is Creekhead Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| There are 32 houses, which is southwest of the property, off of Helmbolt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| still not very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| That property was built in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| That was seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| The report cites that significant amount of residential infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| Of course, I'm not familiar with all the terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| but when I looked at infill, it talked about lots that are vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| It talked about pieces of land that have been not developed, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| This particular piece of property that we've talked about is 16.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Our community is not an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| It is primarily rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| There is no real infrastructure or services that exist to handle such a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| I guess one of our primary concerns is that where will the focus on any design quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| to be compatible with this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| If this RN zoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| we do believe it will have a direct adverse impact on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| It talks about three access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| One is, in fact, Helmbolt Road, which is a minor arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| It is definitely narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| It has multiple up and down slopes, curves, and blind spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| Not a great area to travel on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| The second two roads or local roads are Francis Road and Old Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| All three roads currently present a challenge to the safety of both vehicular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| and pedestrian traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| RN zoning would really dictate a higher density of houses placed on this property for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| In fact, setbacks are going to be smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| The lots are going to be smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| It's really not compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Flooding is another known issue in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| We have dealt with stormwater previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| The development with this zoning would definitely increase the erosion and runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| There is a creek bed that runs through a good portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| One of the things that I looked at in the report, the aerial map that's discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| I'm not quite sure of the relevance of that aerial map other than, you know, a good view from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| It was, in fact, cleared in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| It was not, as I understand it, from neighbors for the purpose of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| There was actually a tree trimming company that operated out of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| In fact, though, they did not use the proper address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| They used neighbors' addresses to fence this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Schools are going to be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| I know the report says that they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| However, I cannot foresee a builder, a developer, would not go ahead and build out on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1010)|
| 0:16:59| I don't think that would be an economic sound decision, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Ms. Lloyd-Better, if you'd wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| I'm going to wrap up very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| If we are considered urban growth, we really need the infrastructure and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| We've been annexed in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| We still sit today, 26 years later, without the proper adjustment structural changes in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1036)|
| 0:17:24| without sidewalks that are needed, and without many other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| And we would gratefully appreciate that the commissioners consider our request to deny this R&2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Councillor King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1062)|
| 0:17:51| John King, Post Office Box 2425 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901, here on behalf of the applicant, John Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1071)|
| 0:18:02| I'm going to pass up at the end of this a series of photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| If I have time to describe what they all show, I'll be happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| But time is of the essence here, so I'm going to just wait and do that at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| and discuss the matter at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| We had before sought to rezone this property with a request for a plan amendment and rezone it to R&5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1103)|
| 0:18:37| The staff had some issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| The neighborhood came forward and pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| And we postponed the matter a couple of times to discuss and meet with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| After that, hearing what they wanted and hearing what they were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| they wanted to keep it low-density residential, we took it off the table, amended our request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1142)|
| 0:19:12| to remove our request for a plan amendment and remove the request for R&5 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1152)|
| 0:19:22| So what we have now is what the staff and most of the people out there were talking about what they wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| We're asking for R&2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| We think that that presents opportunity to develop a property in R&2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1178)|
| 0:19:48| We can continue to discuss with the neighborhood as we go forward from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1188)|
| 0:19:59| We oppose any request for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| As far as the water is concerned, you're going to have city engineering that will be looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| to assure that we're not going to be adding to any issue or problem with the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1212)|
| 0:20:24| The same is true of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| To the extent we're going to have access and where we have access, again, that will be the subject of considerable review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1230)|
| 0:20:40| from city engineering to make sure that we're not impeding or worsening any traffic issue or problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1240)|
| 0:20:52| We have been receptive to the requests of the neighbors to the extent we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1252)|
| 0:21:05| Normally what happens is we get a piece of property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Then we get engineering involved on that particular and specific site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| They do a lot of work analyzing what we're proposing or suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1277)|
| 0:21:28| Then they, as they did here, acknowledge that they're going to be involved in what we do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1288)|
| 0:21:41| Staff has recommended approval of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| The reasons for that are in the report that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| If you have any questions about that report, you certainly have Ms. Hillman here who can respond to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1311)|
| 0:22:03| We, as I say, ask for rezoning from ag to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1323)|
| 0:22:14| We would request approval of our application so we can go forward and present a concept plan and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1355)|
| 0:22:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I'd like to make a motion we approve RN2 per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| We have a motion to approve by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| We have more lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you, Chair Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| I guess my question is for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| I appreciate you guys deciding against the RN5 and going to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| The main difference between RN2 and RN1 is the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| It looks like there's a lot of contours on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| I guess just for clarification, I know that they're concerned about RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| but there will be probably lots in that development that are larger lots that are compatible with RN1 specifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| and then there will be some lots that are smaller in size that are compatible with the RN2 specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| So I guess just to kind of clarify, even though this zoning does take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| and I plan on supporting this decision, the recommendation by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| but just because the rezoning process does take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| not all of the lots in your development will be compatible with RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Some of them may be larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Because if you have all the contour lines and the slopes that are in that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1447)|
| 0:24:17| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| I have a lot of problems following you as some sort of a background sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| that comes with you in my hearing, maybe not the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| but staff said in their report that the ‑‑ I'll try to use their words here a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1467)|
| 0:24:45| Mr. King, could you please pull that mic up near you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| You're having trouble hearing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| We're having trouble hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Most people would not complain about not hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| Staff has said that to approve this RN2 single family residential neighborhood zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1503)|
| 0:25:13| because it is consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| And there may be some of the dwellings that would be on a larger lot than some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| but all of it will reflect the uniformity, if you will, of zoning in that classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1528)|
| 0:25:38| And to the extent that there are different sized lots, they would be blended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1538)|
| 0:25:48| There's that issue perhaps in most any subdivision about some larger lots and some smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| A lot of it relates to things that lay on the ground that you can't necessarily do anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| But it's the intention of the applicant to develop a subdivision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1562)|
| 0:26:14| And I think that if you look at the photos that I'll pass up to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1574)|
| 0:26:21| you'll see that what we will be doing is not going to be out of character for what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1581)|
| 0:26:35| I'm not sure the rest of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| I appreciate your clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Seeing no other lights, we have a motion and a second to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| On to item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Applicant is Logan Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| Location, northeast side of Galbraith School Road, south side of Decatur Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| Approximate size of track, 2.61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| Zoning is RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Existing land use, vacant Galbraith School building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| Proposed use, multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Staff recommendation is to approve the preliminary plan for the Galbraith School adaptive reuse planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1654)|
| 0:27:43| including approval of the requested exceptions to the underlying zoning's dimensional and use standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1663)|
| 0:27:51| subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| Is anyone speaking on behalf of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1683)|

| 0:28:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| You'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I'm Tony Allen, address 133 South Gay Street, and I'm representing the applicant today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| I'll let any opposition speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| We mostly agree with staff's recommendation, but with one minor exception, but I'll let the opposition speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1699)|
| 0:28:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1710)|
| 0:28:49| Ms. Toker, you rabble-rousing down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| I'm really not opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| I just am going to be requesting an addition, so I don't feel like I should be speaking in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| so I'm going to let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1741)|
| 0:29:11| Yes, my name is Melody Manymaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1751)|

| 0:29:22| I live at 620 Busby Road, just across the road, basically, from Galbraith School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| I am opposed, as quite a few neighbors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| I feel like it just is not the apartments are not necessarily conducive to what that neighborhood is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1775)|
| 0:29:45| We've had a lot of growth from the urban wilderness at Bakers Creek, a lot of traffic and all from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| The school is right there, and I just feel like apartments are not the proper development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| I know we need to develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| It has sat empty for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| I'm not opposed to that, but I think it needs to be something that is going to help the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| enhance it, be something that the neighbors can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| If it had smaller businesses in there, I'm not sure what we could do there exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| but something that would be an enhancement to the neighborhood, to the property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| and not any kind of problems that are going to come to those neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1830)|
| 0:30:38| I don't think it will increase the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I think it will decrease those, and I think there's a tremendous amount when the school lets out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| I think it's a lot of safety hazards for that, not to mention for all of the bikers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| and we have a lot of neighbors that like to walk their dogs and their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| and that's just going to be a real safety issue for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| So, I totally oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| I would like to see some kind of development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| I just don't think that is the proper one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Moneymaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1873)|
| 0:31:21| Do you want her to sign her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| That's a good planning clerk out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1889)|
| 0:32:00| Welcome, Ms. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1920)|
| 0:32:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| And I first want to start by thanking each of you for the time that you dedicate to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and responsible planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| From years of experience, I know that it takes a lot of time and dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| Personally, I'm delighted to see plans for this historic building to be put to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| It has potential to be an asset to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| with some of the community benefits HEO Design has listed in their concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| I appreciate the applicant and new property owners have recently met with the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| and opened up dialogue for concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| A couple items I'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| The exit onto Woodlawn from Galbraith School Road has been a problem for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| The concept plan presented lists out some community benefits for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| One huge benefit would be to resolve the issues with this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| In my comment to commission, I mentioned the idea of stop signs at either end of Galbraith School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| As you all can probably guess, I'm not a traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| That's why we're requesting the developer commission a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| for the impact of this development combined with the current traffic on this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| and provide some solutions to make travel more safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| The staff report lists an estimated 737 daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| That's only 13 trips under the 750 daily trips that would automatically trigger a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2020)|
| 0:33:49| In addition, the applicant acknowledges this is a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| Many residents in the neighborhood would like to see the integrity of the building preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and protected by official inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| After the project is complete, this property should then have a historic overlay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| Therefore, I request both the registration and overlay as additional conditions for this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| so the conditions I'm asking is traffic study, registrar with historic places, and then a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2058)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you again for your time, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you, Ms. Toker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| Thank you, Ms. Toker and others, for the helpful feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| In this process, we've reached out to several neighbors and neighborhood association members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| and have made efforts to respond to concerns, and so we do appreciate all the feedback we've gotten thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And we are working to help mitigate some of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| As one example, we intend to regrade the corner of Decatur for better sight lines and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| to touch on Ms. Toker's concern for traffic safety and sight lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| We also presented the plan to the neighborhood meeting, taking notes on their helpful questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and we've heard a great deal of support for the project so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| So thank you for all the engagement we've received, and because of that engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| we have a long list of items that we're looking into as we implement the design going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| I want to discuss the one and only thing that we disagree with staff on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| but first I wanted to respond to Ms. Toker specifically regarding her feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| We will work with the engineering department, of course, on all their traffic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| We will work to meet all their standards and guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| We trust their judgment in regards to traffic issues with this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| and we know that they've already stated a couple of requirements that we're looking to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| like in regards to the intersection that Mrs. Toker brought up with sight lines from the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| So I believe many of the traffic concerns will be sorted out as we move forward in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| On her second point, with regard to historic nature of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| we absolutely recognize the historic significance of the Galbraith School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| and we are discussing ways that we can recognize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| We're having conversations amongst ourselves and with our client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| and we can't agree to any requirements at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| but there are multiple incentive options to recognize it as a historic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| But if we were to take a different route than what is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| we know we would have to come back before this commission and request approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| So we believe requiring a designation would be an undue requirement at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| And then moving on with our slight disagreement with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| we feel we would like to request the complete removal of the percentage cap on metal siding material on the new facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| and this would just apply to the new addition, the new facade, and not the existing in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| But what we have in mind is most likely not what anyone is picturing when they think of metal siding on a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| So we're hoping to utilize a material made of metal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| but not necessarily any sort of corrugated siding material or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| It's more in regards to the durability of the material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| and many of these metal materials, they emulate other materials similar to cementitious and hardy type materials like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2283)|
| 0:38:14| So we are more concerned with the functionality and durability of the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| However, we're not at a point in the design where we know that percentage of what we're looking to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| and so we just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| It is something that we couldn't get a variance on later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| so we believe it's appropriate to request it here in this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| And so which plan development, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| exists to encourage and allow more creative and flexible developments that then is possible under the existing district zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2322)|
| 0:38:52| And so we just request that you would vote with our request without a percentage restriction to allow some more creativity with this specific site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2332)|
| 0:39:02| With that, thank you for your consideration, and I'll stand by for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you, Mr. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| I guess my question is for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Why was that restriction on percentage of metal material conditioned in this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2356)|
| 0:39:26| So the typical cap is 15%, so we're not recommending denial of increasing the cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| but we're still thinking that a cap is still somewhat appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| So if you remove the cap, you could potentially end up with a full metal building as the addition to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| I'm not saying that that's the applicant's intent, but that would be allowed if that cap were to be completely removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| And so given the historic context of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| staff believes it's appropriate to have the majority of other materials with metal siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| Metal is durable no matter what type of siding it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| We understand that they're wanting to use more the decorative architectural panels as opposed to just like a regular type of siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| but the ordinance doesn't make that distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| So we're capping it at 25% is our recommendation, which is a 10% increase over the 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2410)|
| 0:40:19| Last year, I wanted to follow up on that specific question that Amy had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| because we all know that building materials change over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and new things come out that we're just not aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| and it sounds like they haven't even picked it out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| And I would realize why we would want to stick to that lower percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| because you wouldn't end up with something just terribly out of place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| What would staff's option be if they do come up with a material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2448)|
| 0:40:58| Would they have to come back for an additional approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| and submit architectural elevations and material selections and let us relook at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| Is that a staff thing, or how would we proceed if we chose not to approve his specific request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| but understand the sensitivity around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| So if I'm understanding it correctly, if you supported staff and went with the 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| but they submitted something that had maybe 35% or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| are you asking what that path would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| What would the applicant's path be if they took what staff recommended today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| but they found a material, because they don't have one now, that they feel strongly about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| Would they be able to come back through commission for that specific request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| Yes, the preliminary plan has minor and major modifications built into the plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| so they could come in under, depending on what it was that they wanted to change, either a minor or a major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| First of all, the adaptive reuse of these older schools is not an easy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| I would like to first applaud the developer for a really creative plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| and I think this would be a fabulous asset to Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| With all due respect to Mrs. Toker, which I do miss seeing you, Mrs. Toker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| but for this to be registered on the historic register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2559)|
| 0:42:49| the developer would have to go through a number of steps, which can be lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| They've got to go through the Tennessee State Historic Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| and then they've got to be approved by the National Park Service, which is a federal agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| The developer will have every incentive to go down that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| and I would highly recommend that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| because they would get some really nice historic tax credits from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| but it's not a given that the National Park Service will approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| So I don't think we should make that a condition of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| just because it could push them out 12, 24 months, and it still might not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2601)|
| 0:43:30| So anyway, I'm for this development, and I think it would be a great asset to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| I'm also really excited to see this vacant property get a new breath of life into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| and that's just, I think, going to be a very good thing for the community and for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| I'm excited to see that there is a path to deal with the discrepancy around the percentage usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| but it strikes me as interesting that we look at that percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| and recognize that in planned development we want to have more of a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| We want to have more collaboration and be able to be a little more flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| and it sounds like we found a path for that one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| I wonder how that reflects in the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| To Ms. Toker's point, there are only 13 trips different in terms of the threshold that gets hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| So if it's planned development, is that another aspect that we want to look at as being flexible on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| And that's a genuine question to the commission to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| One additional thought on the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| because I don't necessarily believe that this one development is going to be the biggest driver of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2686)|
| 0:44:54| no pun intended, but the biggest driver of different traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| There's a lot going on in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| If you're familiar with it, the Baker Creek bottoms and the bike trails and new restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| all of these things in that area are going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| and have actually already started changing the patterns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| So I wonder if there's another avenue in terms of getting some greater attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| what are the growth patterns and traffic patterns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Again, question for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Commissioner Rolf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| I'm interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I like this project as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| I went to school there when I was a kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| and it's been blocked up and boarded up ever since then, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| But as far as being historically recognized, I'd love to see that happen as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| So my question would be the process of being historically recognized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| that takes place while they're constructing, or does that have to be before anything happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| It has to be before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| Being such a lengthy process, I don't know how we can force that hand by making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| But I'd like to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| The other thing, I'd like to hear from the city on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| Curtis Williams, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Regarding the traffic counts out here, trip generation for this project, the 730-something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| that was generated based on a local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I'll have to eat this mic, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| The study was based on, or the trip generation was based on a local trip count that was developed locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2807)|
| 0:46:56| And so if this project were, say, in another community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| they would use a more widely accepted count for this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2820)|
| 0:47:08| Through the Institute of Traffic Engineers, they published data on various different types of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| And if you were to apply that number, you would be looking at 500-something trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| So you would actually be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| So the local rate is probably a little conservative as far as it's generating more trips than maybe would in another community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2843)|
| 0:47:34| So generally speaking, that threshold, that 750, has been typically a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| That's kind of been the tipping point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| And when folks have fallen below that, we have not required a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2863)|
| 0:47:52| Are there plans to redevelop the roadways or do anything as far as that goes in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| To my knowledge, there's not really any major plans there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| There's some plans to do some intersection work at Sevierville and Lancaster to do some sidewalks in that area close to the Roundup restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2883)|
| 0:48:16| But as far as if a study was triggered, typically a Level I study only evaluates the access point of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| So you'd really be talking about studying the driveway or driveways depending on the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| And so that would maybe have minimal impact based on maybe some of the concerns that you've heard as far as looking at some of the intersections beyond the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2910)|
| 0:48:45| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| To clarify, so this is the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| So they do come back for the final plan for our approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| And that's where we are saying they could come back potentially with more metal siding than what's currently added as a condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| So the final plan has to be largely consistent with the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| So if they wanted to make any changes, they'd have to do a minor or a major revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| It would be an additional step between the preliminary and the final if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| So they'd have to come back to reapprove the preliminary plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And I guess what percentage of siding would be deemed significant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| That's a little bit nebulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| So if you look at the 16.7 of the zoning code and it talks about the different measures that would trigger a minor or a major change to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2973)|
| 0:49:44| And it does lay out some criteria, but most of the percentages have to do with percentage of parking that you might lose or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| It doesn't really say anything specific about siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| So if they came back over that, I guess it would be up to this body if you guys wanted to set a limit today on what you think would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| And I think we all understand that the goal is the new structure would be the one that has this metal siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3006)|
| 0:50:15| So I think I'd be comfortable if we bumped it up a little bit in this condition, adding for the new addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3015)|
| 0:50:26| And if they want to go above that, then they'd have to come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| I'll go ahead and make the motion to approve the preliminary plan per staff recommendation with the change of item number three being 40% on the new addition only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3032)|
| 0:50:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| We have a motion to approve with a special condition by Commissioner Schelso, seconded by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3053)|
| 0:51:06| I guess I have one other question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Let's say they come back at what will define minor or major if they go over the 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3069)|
| 0:51:22| I'm looking up in that section right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3082)|
| 0:51:36| Okay, so it says the modifications to approved final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| So minor modification, there's a few different criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| An increase or decrease in building height of 10%, building coverage 10%, parking areas up to 20 feet, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| So it seems like 10% of the increase, there's sort of a precedent for that here in terms of building height and building coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| So if you wanted to, I guess, make as part of your condition that if they increase it by more than 10% that it would be a minor modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| Although to do so would mean that they could come in at 49 and not have to go into major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| So there's nothing in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| So I think if you wanted to set some sort of condition or some sort of cap, that would be appropriate in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| Please feel free, Tasha, to correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| I think that's a good suggestion if you're inclined to do that at this stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Or you can allow it to be reconsidered later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| So I am making the change in condition number three to be 40% on the new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3158)|
| 0:52:48| And I guess I'll go ahead and add then to that motion with a minor alteration being a 10% change on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Anything exceeding a 10% increase over your motion would then be a major substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3178)|
| 0:53:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| It's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Got that, Ms. Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| I was trying to pull up his file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| But the 40% is that for the total building including the existing structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| Or is that for just the new structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| And do we need to specify that in the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| He specified the new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| Just the new structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| The new structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Commissioner Browning, if I may request, we did modify that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| Are you willing to second that modified motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| Yes, sir, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Is everyone clear on what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| We have a motion and a second to approve based on the special conditions laid out by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3251)|
| 0:54:27| Moving on to agenda item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| The applicant, Graham Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Location, southeast of Callahan Drive, north side of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Tract information is 33.47 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| Present plan designation and zoning is MDRO, medium density residential office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| community commercial, low density residential, planned commercial, commercial highway 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| planned residential, general residential, and general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| Proposed plan designation and zoning is community commercial and CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry, vacant land, and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| Let's see what we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| We've got two motions to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment to community commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| because it is a logical extension of the development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| The second motion recommendation is to approve the planned commercial zone because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3331)|
| 0:55:37| an extension of the zone district and requires development plan review to ensure the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| quality site design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Tim Graham, Graham Corporation, 2300 O Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Welcome, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Would you like to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| We'll defer to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3368)|
| 0:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| My name is Michelle Guerin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| I live at 1613 Cherrybrook Drive, and I'm here today to talk specifically about Graham's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3402)|
| 0:56:51| or the rezoning in Section B that you referenced on the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3411)|
| 0:56:59| And it only includes the part that I'm concerned about is regarding Lot 1, which is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| currently a part of our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| And that is currently R.B., general residential, and they're requesting it to be changed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| C.A., general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| Yes, that section right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| So I've lived in Cherrybrook subdivision for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| I've raised my children here and love the POW community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| We have seen a lot of growth throughout the years, especially within the last five all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| around our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Our neighborhood is made up of two communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Cherrybrook subdivision has approximately 62 homes, and Cherrybrook condominiums, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| is in the back of that, has 57 condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| We are a diverse group of decent, blue-collar working people, some that have lived here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| since the subdivision was originally built in the 60s and others that have recently moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Many are retired and enjoy visits from their grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| This is a community where neighbors watch out for each other and lend a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| It's a community where any given day you will see a family walking through, enjoying a stroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| a jogger, or a neighbor walking their dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Neighbors enjoy working in their yards, taking care of their homes, and saying hello as others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| pass by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| This is a friendly community, one that is very rare to find, especially in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| It is a rare hidden gem that many people want to be part of and move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| Those that live in Cherrybrook love this community so much that their family members purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| homes here so they can enjoy it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| I loved it so much I did the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| I recently purchased a condo back in the Cherrybrook condominiums for my daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| I say this to you because our community is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| We are concerned that our wonderful subdivision and neighborhood in Cherrybrook will be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| over commercially and our wonderful hidden gem lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| Lot number one of our subdivision is now at risk of being rezoned to commercial, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| R.B. General Residential to C.A. General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| How is that even possible when there are restrictions that run with the land to prohibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| this, unless the majority owners approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| We need a buffer from the commercial areas and lot one provided that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| Within the last two years, Graham did excavating work on property adjacent to our subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| specifically in parcel 06727905, which is located behind lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| They tore down multiple trees, which had previously blocked our neighborhood from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| large, ugly parking lots and box retail stores, opening up our neighborhood drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| Shortly after this work commenced, we were concerned when the flow of water running into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| the small dry bed creek that runs through our neighborhood dramatically increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| This caused flooding, which had never occurred before in the 20 years I lived here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| I was one of those owners that had experienced the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| Changes to adjacent properties can greatly impact our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| I ask that you deny the rezoning of lot number one, specifically on the grounds that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| are restrictions for that lot and that lot is part of our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3619)|
| 1:00:26| Or at least put a strict plan in place to make Graham responsible for installing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| appropriate buffer to our neighborhood from their ugly parking lots and box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| I ask that you carefully consider when reviewing their plans on property adjacent to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| and how it impacts the flow of water coming onto our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| We also are concerned about traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| If you prove lot one to be stripped from our subdivision and rezoned to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| what will stop other lots from having the same thing done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| We just became aware that in December, Graham recently purchased one of the homes in our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| and the lot adjacent to it, specifically 1813 and 1817 Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| We are concerned about that and we do not want this to set a precedence where other lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| can be changed to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| You're okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| You're okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Yeah, so it's just lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| It's lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| We passed out a packet and the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| I think the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| It's funny, when you get old and I was just thinking I've been doing this since the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| and actually was the lead developer on the Walmart Center back in the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| and then we've developed the Target, Lowe's, Kroger in the 90s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| and Lowe's was 1998, 25 years ago, Hobby Lobby, 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3727)|
| 1:02:15| But when you get a little reflective, I used to be the youngest guy in the room when I'd come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3735)|
| 1:02:22| except for the old guy back there, that attorney, he's about the only one older than me now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| so it's kind of depressing a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| But Crown Point is a half a million square foot shopping center on your first handout here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3753)|
| 1:02:42| and obviously we have a lot of national tenants that are in this shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| and as the Planning Commission already noted, this is a natural extension of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3768)|
| 1:02:59| Unfortunately, I didn't know we had...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Because we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| She's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| We have been grading out there for a year or two in between all the rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| but the second page is a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| Well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| The first page, bottom right-hand corner, you can see the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| We call this the Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| This is retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| It's two retail buildings that will have a plaza in between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| and will replace an outdoor storage business that's been there forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| a camper top business and some other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| but the second page is a rendering of what we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| And as you can see, this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| In fact, we've patterned it after one of the developments in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| It's a two-tenant or two-building with a nice courtyard in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| and we have LOIs with national tenants that want to get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| And so Crown Point and this surrounding North Knoxville has become really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| since East Town's been mowed down by Amazon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| is now the third largest retail area here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| with all the residential expansion that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| You know, we have retailers calling and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| this is about the only place to go if you want to be in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| And so the second thing I wanted to point out is on the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| beside Hobby Lobby, you see a 60,000-square-foot building pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| So we hope that in the recent acquisition with the Copeland family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| we were able to acquire some of the properties she referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| and this lot in question and, of course, all the frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| which it's needed because we're full, Walmart's full, Home Depot's full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| and, you know, Karn's, Pal, Hall's are all booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| And so that's the goal here is to just meet the need of retailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| that want to be in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| And as you can see, we're going to have nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| and I would point out that the zoning on the front of the property is CH2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| in the city, or in the city, CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| Part of the lot in question is CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| In fact, there's not any frontage on Cherrybrook that is RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3929)|
| 1:05:37| It's all commercial along the Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| But I want to point out, again, back to my little site plan up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| we won't be accessing Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Our access will be from the two, we have two points of entrance now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| and we'll have two points, and you can see them on the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| on the bottom right-hand corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| And you can obviously see there's no access from Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| Generally, a developer wants to get access as many points as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| especially on a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Here, the Cherrybrook Road was built in the 1960s and it does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| It drops real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Our goal, we're raising our site so it has better connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| and a better relationship with Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| which is what retailers want from the main drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| So there's no access from Cherrybrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| which means there's no increased traffic into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| Obviously, the sector plan does show this as commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| and it's just a slide extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| But our buildings will be near the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| and this is really my first one to go through CH2 with the new recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4011)|
| 1:07:00| and I didn't realize what the landscape requirements were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| If we ever get Gerald Green back over here, I'm going to put him in a headlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| But extensive landscaping, which includes the drive beside Cherrybrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| and so we will have extensive landscaping and a buffer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| So, I mean, it'll be a nice tree-lined buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| The last page I wanted to point out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| Mr. Graham, if you'll wrap up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Am I running out of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Well, let me just point out this aerial that you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Yes, we took the trees down to connect the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| with this front part to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| But you can see along the back of the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| there's a, I measured it, 50 to 60 feet of tree line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| that we didn't touch when we relocated our detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| Our detention pond is probably one and a half, maybe two times bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| Now, granted, during construction, sometimes you have a little overflow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| and we've had our share of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| But there is a tree line that's already along the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Last thing I would say, this is a picture of the view from Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| As you can see, there's plenty of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And then the last thing is, the green on this last sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| the green is our detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| So that's a natural buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| And number two, the blue are the joining neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| that I've developed a relationship over the last 30 years with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| that do not oppose this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| And I can supply letters from them, you know, whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| I would offer the opposition, if you would like, extend you another minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| if you have additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| The opposition, I would extend an extra minute, if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| since Mr. Graham ran over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Do you want to look at these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Yes, I haven't seen the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| So here's the retail shops, not connected there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| There was one more gentleman that wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I don't know if the commission would offer to allow him a minute to speak or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| Commissioner, you guys okay with additional speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| One of my biggest concerns, of course, is in the entranceway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| because all the trees where it opened it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| it looks like he's got a separate entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| You stole my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| So are you going to be putting like a huge buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| Yes, that'll be all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| How wide is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| I'm not sure, but we'll meet whatever setbacks are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| and then there'll be lot one, the Herons, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| Yeah, because John's is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| So there'll be trees all down through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| And there's this huge culvert right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| and I know that's where there's so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| We need to pause for workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| There is a lot of water that is flowing down through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| I've lived there 20 years, and it is, ever since the excavation and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| it's caused a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| Water's come up in places it's never been, where that dry bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| So I do know that there needs to be some more work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| because that's still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| We meet all the ‑‑ that's in Knox County, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| I mean, it's kind of unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| It's city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| So we will meet all the ‑‑ we already have met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| because we couldn't have moved the detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| which you can see used to be up here beside the building pad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| but now it's back there, to take in the additional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| And that original pond was built in 98 when Lowe's was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| and this new pond is built in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| and the requirements are far stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| We are also concerned about precedents being set with lot one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| Mr. Graham has recently purchased the two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| two houses over in our neighborhood, that one and the house next to it, 1813.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| So my concern is that if precedent gets set of changing from residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| in our neighborhood, if that gets allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| then what's going to stop maybe him deciding later to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| to general business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| And that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| You know, we as a community, I manage a Facebook group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| and I also manage the property in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| So as a community, we want to protect our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| We also want to work with him because he is our neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Sir, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| Can I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| Thank you for giving me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| My name is Alan Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| I live at 1612 Cherry Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| I've been in there for almost 40 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| It is a neighborhood that I have valued and worked hard to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| in the sense I'm some of the older citizens in the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| During the time we've been there, we have been tried to be annexed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| and we have fought and stopped the city from taking us over as the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| and we have fought the city trying to put a methadone clinic across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| at one time with the help of Mr. Bill Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| So we are fighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| So the issue that I've got is his continuous takeover of the neighborhood traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4370)|
| 1:13:02| which you go over there on Fridays, Saturdays, the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| It takes you sometimes 15, 20 minutes just to get out of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| because the traffic packs up clean over the hill on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| The question that I also have is are you putting another entrance to your progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| So that means another red light where we've been trying to fight for years to get a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| We've actually had some of our neighbors killed trying to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| Thank God they put a medium out there where we could pull out into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| But everybody coming down that hill doing 70 miles an hour don't pay attention to us trying to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| So it's a dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| This increased involvement of more, I'm not against growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| but the growth against our neighborhood I do not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| And lot one, you have ambitions, I know, to try to take over the whole front section of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4440)|
| 1:14:09| So thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| Mr. Graham, since I gave him, I'll give you about 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| And don't give me three one last items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| I thought I got a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| It sounds like obviously there's some needs here in the subdivision that I think as I listen to them that I can help address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4467)|
| 1:14:36| Yes, we bought a house that became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| Yes, I buy property all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| That's what I do and rent it, whether it's a house or commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| You can go down to my expo center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| We have four houses we bought 15 years ago that are still houses, and we're just renting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| So I did want to make a pitch for ‑‑ we did want to discuss our CA request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| Please be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| So 80% of the shopping center is already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4507)|
| 1:15:18| We don't really see a need to have a planned commercial zone that just requires many, many months of going through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4518)|
| 1:15:29| We're going to build an anchor tenant there that is in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| The plan is pretty much set is I guess what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| And I feel like as a developer, as a 63‑year resident of Knoxville, I've earned, you know, we have good projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4537)|
| 1:15:46| and we can be trusted with a CA zone because we're going to do the right thing because we're building for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4546)|
| 1:15:53| our desire here would be to get Dix or Academy or Publix or somebody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| And so we're just going to add to whatever we have there that will be good for the center and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| In looking at the staff report, I'm a little confused on the recommendation for the rezone is to approve PC, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4572)|
| 1:16:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| The rezone is PC for the planned amendment is community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| So it wouldn't be planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| We are looking at planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| This is staff recommendation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| The applicant requested CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| And so with the staff recommendation of PC, it sounds like a lot of the neighbors' concerns about screening, entrance and egress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4601)|
| 1:16:51| which we've already seen some of that plan, would be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| And so I'll make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to CC because it is a logical extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4616)|
| 1:17:06| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| So we've got on the sector plan, we've got Commissioner Schelso made the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| and then Commissioner Perez made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| Do we have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| And I'll go ahead and make the motion to approve PC zone because it is an extension of the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| and requires the development plan, which I think will allow the neighborhood to get their concerns taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4653)|
| 1:17:42| So we've got on the zoning, we've got to approve the planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| Motion made by Commissioner Schelso, seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4667)|
| 1:18:00| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4686)|
| 1:18:14| Moving on to agenda item 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Applicant is ABITUSA, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| Location, south side of Thorn Grove Pike, southeast side of Rosebud Lane, 7.1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4709)|
| 1:18:37| Present plan designation and zoning is general commercial, hillside protection, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| Proposed plan designation and zoning, business park type 1 and employment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| Existing land use, single family residential and rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| Staff recommendation, approve the sector plan amendment to business park type 1 and hillside protection because it is a minor extension of an existing business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4732)|
| 1:19:03| The second motion recommendation, approve employment center zone because it is a minor extension of an existing business park and is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4743)|
| 1:19:16| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Here for the applicant, Chairman Hill, Chad Tyndall, 249 North Peters Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| Seeing no opposition, would you like to proceed, Mr. Tyndall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Yes, Chairman Hill, members of the commission, members of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Just as a way of brief background, my client did some extensive planning before filing this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| and that is that we met with members of the law director's office, Knox County codes, also planning commission staff concerning this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| We noted we had options for other zoning that would be more intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| We chose to do the easy zone because the property across the street is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| The nearby business park is likewise zoned similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| And so we felt that that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| We've received confirmation for our use of this property or expected use from planning commission that this would be an appropriate extension consistent with the recommendations to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4803)|
| 1:20:13| So that's our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| Oh, I wasn't aware, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Were you here for opposition, Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| I am, and I did sign up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| I would have deferred to Mr. Murphy to allow him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| I'll step down and let him speak, and I may have some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| Sorry, I was busy doing my day job for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| I'm up here to bring your attention to the East Knox community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| This plan has a number of actions identified for it, including there's two pages of this plan, pages 50 and 51, I believe, that are dedicated to the Midway Road interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4848)|
| 1:21:01| So this property is in scope here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| The background report doesn't mention this plan, but this plan was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| It was approved by this body and adopted by a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| So it is an enacted community plan that has weight here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| In the actions for this area, it talks about this area, and it talks about four actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| One deals with the C4 property to the south and to look at doing less intent zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4886)|
| 1:21:35| That didn't occur during the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| That went from C4 to CH2, same intensity, types of uses, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| It talks about an action of site plans, the need to incorporate green space and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| I can't find the exact site plans on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I think they incorporate some, so that might have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Number three is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| It says that the development corps, MPC, and county commissioners should engage with some conversations with TVA, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| and KUB to agree on a boundary to limit future intense development, and that hasn't occurred yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| And finally, talking about the potential for a visitor's center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| Why is all this important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Because when the business park was put in place, the development of the East Knox community plan was the thing that the community was offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4934)|
| 1:22:23| and given and they participated in in order to facilitate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| this desired economic development engine out there in the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| So the community, they went in, they participated in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| and there's an entire summary page of implementation plans on the back end that talk about how to help that community develop and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4955)|
| 1:22:45| Very few, if any, of those action items and implementation plans have been implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| and now you have applicants in that are asking to develop in ways that are contrary to the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| and those action plans that were put in the East Knox community plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| So this proposal for extension of this, which is occurring before a boundary was put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| flies, you know, it's in the face of the community that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| And, you know, they participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| You deserve to actually implement those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| And so this particular rezoning, but also the one we had last month, just flies in the face of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| And that's really, you know, so I guess the question for you is if the external consulting firms were engaged to develop that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5006)|
| 1:23:36| the community participated, planning commissioners were at those sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| staff participated, a plan was put together, and then it's put on the shelf, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| well, it's not exactly fair to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| So I'd ask you to not approve this because this is a substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| and it's a change that is not in line with what the East Knox community plan has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5034)|
| 1:24:05| If I may respond, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| With due respect to Mr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy and I are good friends, and I appreciate much of his work in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| It's difficult to say I understand his points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| but the problem is is that I can't really speak to why the city has chosen not to do certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| or take certain actions consistent with plans that may have been discussed or put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| We simply can't stop property owners or restrict property owners that are having zoning that is consistent with property directly across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| consistent with as planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I always have to stop myself and not say NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| With planning commission, planning commission would have considered these things, and we expect that they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Obviously, they've been involved with these properties for an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| and I understand Mr. Murphy's concerns with respect to items which may have been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| or at least goals that were mentioned that were simply not done or have not yet been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| but I don't think that's a good reason because they may never be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| But I suspect planning commission took these into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| As I mentioned before when I was up here, we had extensive meetings with planning commission, Knox County Codes, the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5113)|
| 1:25:21| We did our legwork before making this application, which resulted in a recommendation both for approval to the sector plan and to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5121)|
| 1:25:31| This property, I think, is a natural extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| It's a short way down, consistent with what this area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| I understand that any time you have business abutting up against some rural areas, you have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| I know this area out there specifically has had a significant amount of opposition over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| but I would ask you to follow planning commission's work and approve both the change in the sector plan as well as change in the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5147)|
| 1:25:57| and I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Thank you, Mr. Kendall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Ms. Warner, addressing Mr. Murphy's comments about the community plan, did you guys consider the community plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5162)|
| 1:26:13| So we have to take precedence with the sector plan, and so staff's recommendation is based off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5173)|
| 1:26:22| Staff recommendation based on what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| The sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5185)|

| 1:26:53| Commissioner Browning went quiet on me, or was that Vice Chair Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| That was your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5217)|

| 1:29:39| I just about didn't make it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| We had an emergency landing in the middle of the Pacific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| In the middle of the Pacific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| Well, on an island, American Samoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| We didn't make it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Thanks for adding that detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| Anyway, this has been a long time getting where we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Been three years at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| What's good about it is it's got better every time we've come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5401)|
| 1:30:08| We're all on one side of the road with a lot of those attached now, which has a smaller impervious footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| And we've addressed the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| So that's going to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| I just want to say I'd like you to follow the staff recommendations on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| My civil engineer is here, Scott Williams, if you've got any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| We've worked with Jim and Steve here at the county roads, got this thing where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5434)|
| 1:30:42| Michelle Porche initially put this out, and she did a great job, especially putting the numbers together for the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5442)|
| 1:30:50| A couple of different calculations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| It got confusing, but it's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| We used some of the things that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| One of the staff members originally said one dwelling unit per acre, and that keeps coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| But that was Mike Brousseau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| And we got letters from Mike saying that once he saw the property, he changed his mind and he's addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| We used Gerald Green as a consultant on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| He, too, helped us cluster this development together to save Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| And also Chris Grangeau at the time helped us with the blood issue and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| I'd just like to ask you to follow the staff recommendations for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5490)|

| 1:31:58| My neighbors and I oppose the concept and development plan being submitted for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| As you probably are aware, this development is being built on a ridgeline, a very steep ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| It consists of 85 acres in Knox County, of which only 61 acres are buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| Twenty-four acres are in the F floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| And under Knox County ordinance, you can't put any type of residence or building in a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5542)|
| 1:32:30| And you also can't use floodway acreage in calculating densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5550)|
| 1:32:37| That's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| This property has only one entrance, or the development has only one entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| a road that comes out on Beverly Road right at Whites Creek where there's a very tiny narrow bridge and a railroad crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5565)|
| 1:32:53| That area floods periodically, as you're probably aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| We submitted a booklet before the hearing today that's got pictures of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| It's not a 50-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| It's not a 10-year or a 5-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| It's an annual flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| Two to four times a year, this property floods and Beverly Road becomes blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| And if this development goes in and the entranceway is put where they proposed, then it's going to be blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| And the residents of the subdivision are not going to be able to get in or out of their subdivision two to four times a year when it floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| It means no fire trucks, no ambulances, no police vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| Because of the problems with this, this property has a long and troublesome history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| Originally, it came up five years ago, as Mr. Gennard said, in March of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| And at that time, your staff recommended no more than one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5624)|
| 1:33:51| And it's very interesting if you'll look back at the minutes from back then to see what some of the comments were on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| The staff said, and their recommendation was based on the extreme slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| and the fact that there's very sparse and small development area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| and the impact that it's going to have on adjacent Broadway warrants a recommendation of only one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5650)|
| 1:34:18| The staff's recommendation was also agreed to by a private engineer that we hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| We hired a gentleman named Robert Christensen, a professional engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| He analyzed this project. We submitted his report in the booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| And he also agrees that the maximum density for this project should be one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| And he said if it goes in like the developer proposes with the concept plan that's being submitted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| it's going to double the water runoff that's going to go down on Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| that already has flooding two to four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| What was very interesting, if you'll look in the minutes, Mr. Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| who was head of the planning commission back when this thing first came up, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| and I'm quoting, this is the worst piece of property that has ever come before the MPC because of all of those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5703)|
| 1:35:13| Back then, you weren't willing to give the developer more than one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| and as a result, he withdrew his application. He waited a while, then he reapplied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| You turned him down again. This went on for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| I think this is the fourth time it's before this planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| because each time you realized that what he proposed was not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Finally, he was able to get the Knox County Commission to agree to giving him a density of 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| up to 2.51 dwelling units per acre. Up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| That doesn't mean you have to give him 2.51. You can give him a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| You don't have to give him any if you don't think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| That's why we're here today, because what the developer did, he took that 2.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and he multiplied it by the entire acreage, the 84 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| Not only the 61 acres of buildable units, but also the floodway units, coming up with 196 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| That's illegal, ladies and gentlemen. You cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| You cannot use floodway acreage in computing densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| His proposal also violates a longstanding policy that you have set down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| saying that if you have only one entrance to your subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| you should have no more than 150 units. That's your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| That's what you've done in the past. He proposes 196.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| If he were to limit that to just the buildable acreage, 2.51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| that would reduce it down to 153 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| So what we're asking you to do is to don't let this thing get any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| If this development goes in as proposed, there's going to be problems down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| If, as Mr. Christensen said, it's going to double the water runoff, there's going to be litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| You can stop some of these problems now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| So what we're asking for, what we'd like to see you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| is to go back to what your staff originally recommended, one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| But if you don't do that, at least follow the ordinance, follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| and make the developer limit his density calculations to only the 61 buildable acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| which would reduce it to 153 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| For the sake of everybody here and the public, could we get – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5852)|
| 1:37:40| Can we get our attorney to address the issue of density in the consideration of the floodway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| Councilor Blakeney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| I was actually just reviewing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Attorney Taylor, if you have a citation for that proposition, I would like to review that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| because I am not aware of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| I have no citation, but I submitted in the booklet you've got a number of other developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| where you've applied that rule and said that the developer could not use floodways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| That's in the booklet you have, those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| I'm going to refer – excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| I'd like to let Mr. Reynolds speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Yes, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| So it is correct that typically we do not look at the floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| We do not allow the floodway zone district acreage to count towards density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| A unique situation here is during the rezoning phase, both the Planning Commission and the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| and going on to the County Commission, it was always known that the desired 196 lots that the applicant had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5921)|
| 1:38:51| and then the calculated 2.5 dwellings per acre was for the entire acreage of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| not just for the area outside the F zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| So looking back at the recordings of both the Planning Commission meeting and the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| there wasn't a discussion of acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Especially in the Planning Commission, it actually came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| are we talking about acreage outside of the floodway, are we talking about the entire property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| And the discussion revolved around 2.5 dwellings per acre for the entire property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| not just the area outside of the F floodway zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| Chair, I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=5971)|

| 1:41:43| This will require six variances and looks like we've got eight alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6103)|

| 1:42:12| And a third motion recommendation, approve the development plan for an attached and detached residential subdivision with up to 297 dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6132)|
| 1:42:23| subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| We have no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| Here on behalf of the developer of Thompson Creek, formerly Thompson Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| As the chair has stated, we're here on concept plan approval and development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| With the concept plan approval, we have several variances requested and several alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6175)|
| 1:43:03| These variances and design standards are the type that are routinely approved by this planning commission on these type of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6183)|
| 1:43:12| I think Mr. Reynolds commented on that at the agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| The variance allow for a reduction in the grading process in the sense to try to keep the property closer to the natural state or existing state it's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6197)|
| 1:43:28| and to minimize steep grades, requiring fill, all that bring on environmental concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| There are also some variances on the roadway that create kind of slight curves on the long stretches of the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6216)|
| 1:43:48| What this does is this establishes and creates traffic calming that prevents that long, straight, narrow where cars tend to accelerate in speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6228)|
| 1:44:00| We ask that you follow staff recommendation concept plan and approve the concept plan subject to the 13 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| With the development plan, as noted in the staff report, this will be a single family development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| It will be in two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Phase one will consist of attached and detached dwellings, 66 detached, 34 attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6256)|
| 1:44:25| And phase two will be 100 detached and 87 detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| This offers somewhat of a variety within the development, especially as it comes to the pricing of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6270)|
| 1:44:40| The townhome is obviously more available necessarily at a lower purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| There will be two access points, Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| I do comply with connectivity requirements at staff and engineering's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| There's an internal connection that will connect phase one and phase two over the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| There are also internal sidewalk connections as well as a pedestrian stub out at Bill Keaton Drive, which is an adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6300)|
| 1:45:11| With these different improvements, these sidewalks, as you're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| Knox County is in the process of establishing pedestrian connections from these subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| that allow connectivity all the way to the Gibbs School facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| We think that's a great asset for the development, for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| This density is 2.75, and I would submit that's substantially less than these neighboring developments that have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| I believe that to the south of us, there's three different ones, and approved at anywhere from 4 to 4.25 growing units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6340)|
| 1:45:48| It is consistent with the zoning ordinance, the general plan, and the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| and we would ask that you approve the development plan subject to the three conditions as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230209?start=6360)|
