| 0:00:41| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=41)|

| 0:01:05| they'd like to give to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=65)|

| 0:01:22| I know the superintendent said he wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=82)|

| 0:01:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| And we had communicated that with the commission offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| The board deferred action on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| And we would like to request that commission also defer action on that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| So that's item twelve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Yes, item twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| I'd also ask that we defer item twenty-nine for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=113)|
| 0:02:03| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=123)|

| 0:02:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Could we request a deferral for 60 days of item 19 regarding the roundabouts on Bob Gray Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| We have met with a citizen's group that has an interest in the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| There's some additional fact-finding and information we need to share with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| so we could use a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=166)|

| 0:03:33| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=213)|

| 0:03:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=229)|

| 0:03:52| And it's really fairly close to being in the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| but it's probably a little bit closer to the Dutchtown side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Anything else with regards to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=242)|

| 0:07:48| No move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| We'll take it up on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Yes, item seven was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| You want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Item seven is resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| It's approving the letter of agreement with the Partners for Breakfast in the Classroom for a grant award in the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| of $357,011.35 to implement breakfast in the classroom in 17 Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| Mr. McIntyre said he would not be here today, but he would be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| At the same time, he said his associates would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| And I see Mr. Oaks coming to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| So, Commissioner Smith, you have a question for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Russ, just explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Is this a one-time situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And what's this being next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| This is a one-time grant, largely from the Walmart Corporation, which allows us to expand what we're doing with breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| in the classroom to 17 additional schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| It goes largely to buy equipment to allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| So it's hard end items, one-time purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| And there is a small match for us, but that small match is really in kind in our labor that we already have involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=538)|
| 0:09:08| in food service preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| So it's nothing additional that we don't already have in our operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| Is this part of the schools that we the community schools that we're expanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| Some of them may be community schools, but these two initiatives are not linked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| We're still in the process of determining the exact locations of where we will expand those community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| My only concern is, you know, where does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| You know, if we keep giving, is that the role of government to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| You know, so we'll take a look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| You know, that's just where I'm at with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| We just keep expanding, expanding, expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| And, you know, I'm looking at the parents' responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| You know, what are the parents doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Russ, can we get a list of those 17 schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Yes, sir, I'll send them over if they're not in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| They're in the grant agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| I'm not sure if you've got that completely in your packet, but I'll get with Joe and we'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| I assume breakfast in the classroom is literally in the classroom, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| So it's not in a cafeteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| It's in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| And in the discussion of that process, have you all, I'm sure you've considered the problems with that in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| just food items, the maintenance aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| So how has that discussion gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| It's gone well with the schools that have volunteered to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| I understand that we have breakfast in the classroom right now in five or six schools and have been doing that for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| number of years, and it's been well received in those schools where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| This is a program that will allow us to expand this to some additional schools, but we have done it in consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| with the administration at those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| So it's not something that we've decided that we're going to put forward, but it's something that we have worked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| concert with schools to determine if it's something they think they want and can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Are these extended contracts for teachers whose classrooms are involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| Our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| I'll have to go back and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| I don't think there's any required additional hours for teachers who are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| And how were the teachers conferred with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| And this is something that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| I would expect that the school administration did that, but I'd have to go back and verify that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| My only concern is that, of course, the burdens on the teachers is that burden is a large subject that we're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=700)|
| 0:11:51| with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| It addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| It was related to the budget requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| And, of course, we're going to be in discussion today about some climate issues, morale issues, and survey and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=717)|
| 0:12:07| So I just want to emphasize that it is for every policy move and change that is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| there are some dramatic consequences sometimes that I don't think are considered in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Commissioner Norman, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| You brought Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| I had some questions before you get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| You're saying you're using this for setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I'm assuming it's going for coolers and ovens and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| That means it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| So what are you going to do next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| We're going to be funding this next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| I mean, you're not going to spend this kind of money, I wouldn't think, and it not be there next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| We buy that stuff and it is ours to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| The equipment is ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| And this equipment will be there and available next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Which means that this is ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| We retain the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| I thought you said it wasn't going to be ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| No, the grant is not ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| But it's the purchase of one-time end items that we will use year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| Is this just elementary schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| I'd have to go back and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| I think it's primarily elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| What part of the grant is going to be materials that will be considered leftover, you know, utensil wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=795)|
| 0:13:31| About $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| So then we've got $57,000 worth of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Let me get Ms. Rhea Tiefteller from our food service department to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| I don't believe that any of these funds go to food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| Commissioner Brown, in the packet there, there's a, I mean, breakdown of marketing, equipment requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| small equipment requests and training and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| It's in the packet pretty well explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| And the schools are listed in the packet also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| Yes, would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| My question was if the grant money would go to purchase food items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Yes, and if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Rita Tiefteller, and I'm a senior field manager for Knox County School Nutrition Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| None of the grant money will be used to purchase breakfast items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Those breakfast items would be purchased to feed the students regardless of whether we have breakfast in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| or it's actually in the dining room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| If not, do we hear a motion that we approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| I mean, we put it on consent anyway, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=886)|

| 0:15:04| I'm going to vote no on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=904)|

| 0:16:26| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| There is a revised one, so okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Commissioner Smith has been studying this days in advance of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=991)|
| 0:16:43| What I said, $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| So that's being sent on without recommendation to consider on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| What about, let's go to item 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Item 21 is resolution 502.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| It's approving the fiscal year 2012-2013 defined service contract with Innovation Valley, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| and the amount of $125,000 as approved in the fiscal year 2012-2013 Knox County Budget for Economic Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1020)|
| 0:17:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1030)|

| 0:17:12| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| It's being sent on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| We'll discuss it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Item number 23, resolution 504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| It's approving the defined services contract with the Young-Williams Animal Center of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| to promote the responsible care and welfare of animals for a 15-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2027 in the amount of $633,190 annually for the first five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1054)|
| 0:17:44| and adjusted every five years thereafter based on the consumer price index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Grant, is this yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| Question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| When we say promoting responsible care and welfare of animals, this is a rather lengthy term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| Can you give us some ideas to what we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| And when we say adjusted every five years, so this $663,190 will be for the first five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| and it will be adjusted and that price will be good for another five years, adjusted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| and so we're looking at two price adjustments, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Yes, that's correct on your second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| On your first question, Jason Lay with our finance department is here and also Dr. Blackwell is here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Young-Williams Animal Center to answer any questions related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| But do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Jason Lay, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| It's set up like a regular defined service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Indicators will be the incoming animals from the city, county, and out-of-county population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| how long we hold them, leave-the-lab rates, pretty much everything we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Nothing is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| When you say out-of-county population, how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| We have, for some reason, and it's a credit to Dr. Blackwell and the Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| people in surrounding counties think that their animals have better chances to get adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| And so they bring those animals here to Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| And we have been keeping track of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| How many of those would you say have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I guess where I'm going with this is, do you get them inoculated and those types of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| And are we bearing the cost if there's any shots or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| So people from out of Knox County could come in and would be responsible for paying for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| They pay an out-of-county fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| And how much is the out-of-county fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Ten bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Twenty dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Plus the fact that there's also a fee when they're adopted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| Having served on the board down there, you asked about the responsible care and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| That's kind of a nice way of saying putting up with a lot of stuff that goes through down there, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| Let me tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I mean, it's they do a marvelous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| They have a group of dedicated people down there that are working tirelessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| We even have some of the inmates that are coming down in the morning before they open now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| to help do some of the cleaning and so forth so that the staff can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| They're running on a shoestring and doing it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| And they have set things up to a point where I think we're going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| So I'm very happy with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Quick question, I guess, Dr. Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Can we still use inmate labor since they're separating from the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Are we still planning on doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1257)|

| 0:21:21| under the Tennessee Property Tax Freeze Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Commissioner Burroughs is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Can we send this on without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1287)|

| 0:21:44| Rules Committee is going to take it up on Thursday, and they'll come back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| So we'll take it up on Monday after rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1314)|

| 0:21:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1321)|

| 0:22:03| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| We have two or three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| A couple have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| The discussion on 287G from Commissioner Broyles, if we'll just send that on and do that on Monday since she isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| Clerk, what was the next discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Through the course of some shrewd negotiating in the past couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| Legacy Parks has acquired some additional properties that are contiguous to the urban wilderness in the south part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1347)|
| 0:22:37| And Doug Battelle has more information on that than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| He's still back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| I can give you a little bit more information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| But the bottom line is Legacy Parks purchased the properties, and now they want to give them to the county to have them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| a part of this park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| So Senior Battelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Not Battelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Battelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Senior Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| That just means I'm old, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation, Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| If you recall, Commissioners, I believe it was last year Commission gave about $20,000 to the effort of fundraising in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| South Knox County to complete sections of the urban wilderness corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| So this is coming back to us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| The value of this property is actually about $55,000, so that was a lot of private fundraising at a pretty good rate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| went into this effort to create this whole trail system for walkers, bikers, hikers, joggers, a lot of different folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| So these are five parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| It's only about 15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| They're clustered in two different areas that are kind of key connectors between different parks in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| Again, this will be very, very little maintenance because they're all being built by volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| and through efforts of grants with the city and county combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| And, again, they're pretty rugged properties, pretty wooded properties that are just trail connectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| It also is protection for us, for the future of our park lands, about encroachment for development, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1436)|
| 0:24:07| And I'd just like to say again, we recognized Brian Hand some months back for the work he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| and his group with Appalachian Mountain Bikers have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| But they continue to do a fantastic job in clearing and maintaining some of these trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| I mean, some days they'll, on a weekend, they'll have 100 people out there more working on them, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Yeah, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| I guess my question revolves around these are actual pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| These are not easements, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| This is actual narrow strips or whatever of property that's going to be owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Doug, do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Are we going to be inheriting any buildings on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| These are undeveloped parcels, pretty steep and heavily wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| We'll make sure we didn't have more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Anything else, discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Okay, thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Our next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| The Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| I just wanted to inform the commission that the letter that I proposed to send to request a revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1520)|
| 0:25:31| and expense statement about political activities from the chamber has not been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| There was a response, obviously, that you received an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| It didn't really address the things that I was concerned with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| but at least the chamber was trying to be, I guess, proactive about some part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| So I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I have been conferring with the law department, and I just haven't gotten finished yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| But I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| And I'll send that letter out, hopefully, this week, and then, of course, forward you a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| But it's just to, you know, it's just to get a little better handle on how those expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| for those political activities, primarily the Ridge Top Plan and the school effort that we just went through in budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| just to have an outline, sort of a revenue statement, financial statement about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Next discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Oh, Dwight, you had mentioned something about Christian Academy that you said you were going to bring to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| and we didn't get all the gist of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| It's just granting an easement in the right-of-way for a sign that CAK would like to put on Christian Academy Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| It's no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| The schools for, excuse me, the signage for Knox County schools obviously exists within the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| So it's a pretty standard item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Is this something you're going to put on this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| Yes, sir, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| No, I guess we need to move it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| No, you're going to have a piece of paper for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| We'll have some narrative and detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Then we'll be sending it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1631)|
| 0:27:27| Our next discussion item is about the teacher survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| I just thought it might be helpful to have it discussed within the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| and see if we have some other opinions or observations about teacher survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| I know we have some people here in the audience, like Jennifer Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| who probably could speak to the subject of a teacher survey well as the school was about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1669)|
| 0:27:58| performed some types of survey relative to their strategic plan, I believe, in the past school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| So, anyway, I guess could I kick it off with some questions to Jennifer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| if Jennifer would be willing to share some information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Jennifer Evans, 8317 Alexander Cabot Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Hey, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Besides being the mother of the millennium, we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| Those of you who don't know that she's a mother of triplets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| And so, anyway, that's enough said probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| It's my other job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Could you give some information, just general information, about the previous survey that teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| I think every teacher in the county was given an online survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| Are you talking about the one that SCORE facilitated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| It was a state-facilitated, well, SCORE, which is separate from the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| But they did a survey maybe two years ago asking about the environment, teaching environment, classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1743)|
| 0:29:12| resources that they were given to do their job, professional development, leadership, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| And there hasn't been another one since that time done by KCS, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Or has there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I don't know if KCS has done one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Are you familiar with the SCORE survey and some of the conclusions drawn from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| I mean, I don't, I wasn't aware that I was going to be asked questions about it today, so I didn't bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| And I don't, you know, I'm not ready to report on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| But it's online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| You can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Just to the subject of another survey, in discussions with the people that you're associated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1784)|
| 0:29:55| what's the response or what's the attitude about another survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| I definitely think it should be coordinated and orchestrated along with the school board, if not done by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| It just, they seem to be the most appropriate body to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| I definitely think your coordination, your collaboration with them is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| But they are the school board, and I think they have, you know, that kind of falls within their realm, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| But I definitely think it's great that you guys are interested and should do it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| I guess part of this question, and I'm foggy on this issue of the past surveys that have been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| I know there will be some confusion with what is probably a building-level survey called a climate survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| And sometimes those are done, and teachers aren't aware of, well, how broad this survey is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| or whether it's a system-wide survey, or whether it's a building-level survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| So I've got to get caught up a little bit on what's been done and, you know, the conclusions drawn from recent activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1854)|
| 0:31:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| And I would suggest, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I would suggest that if you are going to do some type of survey that you have a very specific, what's the goal in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| you know, what do you hope to accomplish, not just kind of a broad, let's ask some questions and see what we find type fishing expedition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| I think you really should have, you know, what are we trying to achieve here, what's the time frame, what are you going to use this data for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Yeah, I have some very specific areas that I would like to see addressed in a questionnaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| But it's not just my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| I mean, I want to have several people involved in the construction of the questionnaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| I don't think it's necessarily the commission's duty to do that, or maybe that's out of our lane, as we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1899)|
| 0:31:48| I don't know exactly how to go forward with this, but I think certainly a survey is one, is something from the feedback I get from my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1908)|
| 0:31:57| from people who call me, and I mean teachers call me quite a bit and have been calling me quite a bit since, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| my opposition to, and fairly aggressive statements sometimes that have been made in opposition to school policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1923)|
| 0:32:13| I feel like a survey absolutely should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| Somehow an independent, some independence, it has to be and it can be, without a doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| we can do this where teachers are not afraid of retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| And that's been the other, you know, the caveat about previous surveys is there's always like, well, can I be identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1951)|
| 0:32:40| And if I have been identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| And certainly there have been instances where there have been surveys done and there's been retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| I mean, there's people that call me and they tell me that, and they say, this is not coincidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| And so there's a fear about the school system doing a survey and being in charge of a survey if it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| if this anonymity can't be ensured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| So we're trying to get our hands a little bit around structure, and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| but I think the survey needs, I think some type of survey needs to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Yeah, and I, you know, going back to the trust issue, that's probably why the score did that one that the state did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1991)|
| 0:33:19| because the same kind of trust issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| I might suggest Great Schools Partnership or some other independent entity possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| We would question independence when we came to the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| So, you know, independence, that's a word that's kind of like conflict of interest, like who really doesn't have some, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| So independence is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| So I think that's where we're, I certainly want to, for any teachers that are watching this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| or paying attention to this meeting, I want to assure them that there are people that think that their opinions are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| important and need to be delved into at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| It's an important time that it's a topic that we don't need to push it off forever and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| we'll work on this in the next budget year after January or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| No, I think this is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| It's a good time because teachers have been, you know, they have been alert to this subject in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| And one other thing, you know, this year's score has been tasked also with doing a set of roundtables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| There's nine roundtables, thousands of interviews they've done specifically on the teacher evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| That was published probably a month ago, and today the Department of Education, the State Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| released their report and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| And that will, that is thousands of interviews and survey online in person and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| So as it relates to teacher evaluations, you can, I mean, that's a survey, but it's narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| but it's a survey when you talk about the perceptions and the outcomes of the teacher evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| So that's another resource to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| And you and I obviously need to have some discussions, and so I'll give you a call and we'll talk more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| While I agree with really everything that Commissioner Norman said as far as the need of a pulsing of the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2115)|
| 0:35:26| in the not-too-distant future, one thing I don't want to do, and it does, it has to, it has to be by an independent body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2126)|
| 0:35:37| And sometimes perception is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| So I definitely agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| But the one thing I don't want to do in this whole thing is alienate the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2141)|
| 0:35:49| They have to be a part of this decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| And hopefully it will be a joint process and they won't feel that we're pushing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| So, you know, I just want to put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I don't think anyone disagrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| But, you know, what I don't want is, you know, folks start reading or looking at commission meetings and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| oh, well, here they're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| They're going after the school board's business again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| And that's not what this whole thing has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| That wasn't the vision when we talked about it during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| I've heard nothing to sound like it's that way now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| But I do think we need to partner with them to choose an agreed-upon third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2183)|
| 0:36:32| I like SCORE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| I think that, you know, have really well thought of folks running SCORE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| Extremely highly regarded folks that created SCORE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| You know, I've not heard a, to this point, not really heard a disparaging word about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| I actually attended at least half of that session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| It went a little long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I think we had to come here when they were here over at the university discussing that writing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| So I think they're doing a good job and they do have data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| But, you know, I think we need to take a little narrower approach, not statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| I mean, we're here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| We need to ask targeted questions along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| But, you know, so that's my plea is that in this whole conversation that we're including the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| not including the school board, we're partnering with the school board in how to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| And then one other person, I see Sherry Morgan in the audience from President KCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| Does she want to have a comment or have anything to say about, you know, what the perception is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| I just want to give you an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Don't feel obligated, but I just want to give you an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Mr. Norman, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| I appreciate Mr. McKenzie's comments and certainly agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| We don't want to be about alienation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| There's obviously an inherent tension between this board and the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| and maybe a perceived disrespect of us by the way we delve into school matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| But I just think they're so critical that there are certain topics in certain times of the year when we have to take this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| And that's one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| One of the, you know, and when I think of alienation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| I think what I immediately think of is the alienation of teachers towards the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| That's a really more important topic to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| And the fact that these teachers are without a voice somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| or they felt like obviously from their lack of support of this, of KCS's proposal this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| they have told us, in effect, that we have not been included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| And so there is this feeling of alienation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| I don't know how the school board bridges that gap unless they have some type of they step across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| and they have something like an independent survey that truly can allow teachers to express themselves with freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2340)|
| 0:39:12| and total anonymity and without any feeling of retribution or consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| And, I mean, you guys know I taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| So, I mean, I am speaking to you firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| I am a firsthand recipient of punitive action while I was in the classroom and while I was on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2368)|
| 0:39:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| A few of you I've shared this with personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| So I know it takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| I know teachers are afraid to speak up because I experienced it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| I experienced it directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| So it's not something that's just conjecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| It's not, you know, I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| So it's something that will be healthy for this profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| This type of survey, if it can be done well, will be something which will be a very welcome tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| It should be a welcome tool to Dr. McIntyre and to his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| And that's what I hope it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I hope it will serve us and serve the school board and serve the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| and serve the children and the parents of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Mr. Wright, there was a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I don't know if that was you or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Yeah, that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| We've tossed around several terms, anonymity, staying in the lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| But I think what has happened is that during the budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| when I start getting 200 e-mails a day and telephone calls every 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2444)|
| 0:40:52| a third of them on my cell phone, which is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| I just sometimes wonder how people come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| But if anyone wants my cell phone number, ask me for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| I'll give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| You can call me any time of the day or night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| You just might not get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| But, no, where I'm headed to with this is this is hard to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2466)|
| 0:41:17| I really don't want to say this word again, but I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| It was said from the podium, fishing expedition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| That sort of turns me in a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| When I look at today's print media, Monday, today, print media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| I see the school board trying to call us out on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| I mean, I don't want to be blunt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| They're trying to call us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| And I'm the one that went and sat for 19 or 21 months, I don't remember which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| two meetings a month for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| I kind of understand the problems they're up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| One of the problems they're up against is they don't get what they consider to be sufficient money from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| But what I have to consider is what people tell me sufficient money should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| I have 40,000 people in the 8th District to represent, and I hope I do a good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| At least it's what I got over the phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| It's what I get at the IGA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| It's what I get at East Town Mall at the Wendy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| People are beginning to recognize who we are and tag on to us in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| and say, I like this and I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| The survey deal probably is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| And the reason I say it's a good idea is because we got so many negative comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| as we went through the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| How do we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| We're questioning anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Well, you have 100 school teachers in a room, give out 100 surveys, you don't know which one got which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| They don't need to be numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| You take up 100 when they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I think the problem is that, as I see it, is that if you just put a survey out there online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| five teachers can answer it 20 times and 20 teachers won't answer it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| So that we don't know what the results might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| But let me say this up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| The operation of the school system is up to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| The surveying of the teachers, probably to me, is up to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| The administration of the school system needs to come up with an outcome which doesn't look like the last budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2614)|
| 0:43:45| The last budget cycle had plenty of holes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| At first blush, the school board budget was up $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Never discussed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| The mayor said he could put in three more million dollars non-reoccurring to see if some little program would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| We added on another, well, this, that, and the other pieces and parcels of calling it this, that, and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| which I don't know what this, that, and the other might be called today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| More money was added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| And then I'm going in a circle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I'm going back to the newspaper today saying, why can't we throw another $17 million on top of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2667)|
| 0:44:37| It's just not setting well with me to be in the position that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| I just think we're going down a rabbit hole here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| And I don't know where we're going to end up popping out on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| You know, we, this body, started getting in school board business way before this budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2703)|
| 0:45:13| And maybe some districts were all negative, but my comments toward them, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2713)|
| 0:45:21| when I'm in the Kroger, in the Rush, or wherever, my comments were coming to me were maybe a little different than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2721)|
| 0:45:31| So we all represent our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| But, you know, to be blunt, when we start building schools that school board didn't ask us to build, we started down this hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2733)|
| 0:45:45| And we realized, I thought, that we needed to have some conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| We needed a timeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| We needed to regroup and refocus in similar ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| And so we spent our time and talents and energy to go to Maryland and have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| I mean, I took that at first blush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| I mean, now we're acting like we're four years ago or six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| We got no lady here today, but gentlemen, we're going backwards in this whole conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| They're going backwards, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| They're making statements, you know, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| All I'm saying in this whole thing, let's stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| Let's ask the question, what do we want out of this deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| Do we want to, do they want to stick it in our face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Do we want to stick it in their face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Or do we want to pulse the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| What do we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| We want to pulse the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| If that's what we're doing, let's not talk about anything else but pulsing the teachers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| Because we do have constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| We do have agreed orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| So we can't do it in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| So we have to do this thing in lockstep with the law director and making sure that we're having this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| we're not overstepping from that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And so that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| We were passionate about wanting to understand what the teachers felt during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| Every one of us were passionate about wanting to get that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| And now we're talking about something totally different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| I hear, okay, if that's what we want, there's a way to go get it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| There's a way to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| And all I'm saying is let's go the proper way to get that data and make sure everyone's on board with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2859)|
| 0:47:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Independent, independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Great partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| They're not perceived that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| They could be, but they're not perceived that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Let's move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| But let's have that conversation together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| We say we're going to meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Probably coming time to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| So, you know, let's do it, but let's, in my opinion, do it the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| and be more inclusive and collaborative in this and not necessarily, you know, us against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| So that's my hope and wish in this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| Quite frankly, I am fed up with being told that the commission has no right to question where two-thirds of this county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2913)|
| 0:48:45| budget goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I think we would be totally remiss if we did not at least ask some questions to find out what's going on with that two-thirds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| of the budget that we give out every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| So if we're stepping on somebody's toes, then they've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| I think that's being studious and good stewards on our part by looking and seeing where this money is being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| I would like for us to keep on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| As far as this survey is concerned, like Commissioner Wright brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| there was enough questions and enough complaints come across our e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| and phone calls over this last budget process to let us know that there is some unhappiness out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| So if this survey is what it takes to find out what's causing the unhappiness, let's get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| and do it and shut up and quit the bickering and get the job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I need to go back for just a second to a school that was built that the school board did not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| And Commissioner McKenzie was at Hardin Valley Academy or in addition to the addition at Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| And I don't remember how Powell Elementary or Middle School was renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| It would take someone that was on commission before my time to give the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| But building a new school at Carter is something that's behind us, and it took about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3007)|
| 0:50:16| We can continue to bring it up if we need to backscotch what's going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| The northwest middle school, I was by there yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3022)|
| 0:50:31| It's a school that's taking off well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| I was at the Hardin Valley Academy opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| It's a nice school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| I believe that my fervency in Carter Elementary was to the fact that I was looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| and represented people that wanted equality in school facilities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Let me wrap up our discussion here by saying I'm not real sure where we got to the point of it's us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| versus them on this teacher survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| It's not like this came out of left field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| We talked about it at Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| It was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| It was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| It was discussed during the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| At that time, no one stood up and said, no, it's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Let's don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| At the time, it was like, oh, well, maybe it might be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Now, all of a sudden, it seems to me that there seems to be issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| Who's going to do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| I really don't care who does what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| I don't care how the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Well, I do care how it's structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| But I don't care if it's a school board or a commission or a joint or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| I just want to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| The reason I want to get it done is because I really feel like asking our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| and I have heard from numerous teachers who like the idea of us doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Today, after the newspaper article, I must admit, I was in New York City over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| got stuck at LaGuardia last night and didn't get in until noon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| so I didn't get a chance to look at all my e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| But I have received two companies, I believe two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| who have said they would be willing and would love to do this survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| They do it, and they said they're Knox County based, and they said, you know, talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| I'm not saying we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| I'm just saying these are people that have stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| And one of them is from the University of Tennessee, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| It's one of their departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| So there are people out there willing to do this, and I think we can do it at a good price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| I think it would be great to have a collaborative effort to figure out, okay, what do we want from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| What are the outcomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| What is going to be the what do we want to get out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| One of the great things about being term limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| and not seeking reelection is that you can kind of tend to speak your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| and I'm in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| So let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| There's a reason that there's apprehension about this survey, and let's just put it on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| Teachers are not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| They don't like this evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| They don't like some of the things that have been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| and I think that there's some apprehension about, well, let's don't ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| Let's just not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| And I hate to be blunt, but that's the way I feel about it is let's don't be afraid of what our employees are going to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| Because if they're going to tell us things that we need to know, it might be helpful not only for us, for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| It may be helpful for the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| It might be helpful for the legislature that takes on education issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| It might be helpful with the Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| I mean, this survey could be wide reaching and could really shed some light on some things that we really need to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And so anonymity to me is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I think they need to know that if they say what they think that there won't be retribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| But I also think that it needs to be structured in a professional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| And I've been involved in research all my professional career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I've been involved in all kinds of research studies and research projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| So I'm very careful about how things are worded, the sample size, who is going to respond, how it's going to be perceived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| how the data is going to be calculated, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| All of those things go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| That's why we need a good company and a good firm to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| But, yes, let's be collaborative and let's get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| But the shots being sent across Gay Street need to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| I thought we were getting along better, and I thought our meetings were good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| But now it seems like that we're preparing volleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| I'm not prepared to do that and don't want to do that and won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| But when it comes to this teacher survey, I think it's vital that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| I think we need to ask the teachers what they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| and try to get some kind of outcomes because I think that it will make us a better school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| And, yes, let's don't be afraid of the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| It may be uncomfortable, and we might not like what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| But if it will make us a better school system and help our teachers and help our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| then it will be well worth it when it's all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| I totally agree, Mr. Chairman, with what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| And I think there is a palpable fear by the system, this is just my observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| that what if a survey that was relatively well done and you could confidently draw a conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3293)|
| 0:55:04| and the conclusion came back that four-fifths of your workforce are somewhat opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| if not extremely opposed, to your strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| I think that would, and it doesn't matter what your strategic plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| It doesn't matter whether it's right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| If four-fifths of it are against it, it is not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| And I think there is an extreme sentiment against aspects, fundamental aspects of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| You know, merit pay is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| This evaluation system is the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| And it's well known that it's driving teachers out of the profession, if not crazy, the ones that are staying in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3343)|
| 0:55:52| So those things need to be addressed in the form of a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| Now, another aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| I know that our law director, Mr. Jarrett, has done some research on a significant amount of research on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3359)|
| 0:56:08| I have not had time to talk to him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| I don't know whether he would want to weigh in at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| or if he has anything to say relative to his exposure to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| I think there was something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Do you have something, Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| Well, the only thing I would add, members of the commission, is that the legal aspects of a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| and it seems to be the crux of the issue, is anonymity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| And as you can imagine, not every legal conundrum can be found either through the Tennessee Code or established case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| It appears that you can create legally an anonymous survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| provided you don't require the participants to give any identifying information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| When I concluded that analysis, I then discussed it with the State Open Records Council, and she concurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| The bottom line is you can do an anonymous survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| It is legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| It's just a matter of the manner in which you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| Those mechanics are beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| Any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| If not, Mr. Andrews, you have something else you want to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I'm trying to lighten it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| I'm going to have myself and the leader of our delegation are planning a dinner or a lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| I prefer a dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| It gives us a little bit more time to set and discuss their legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| And I would like to, I was going to look for a dinner in late September, early October on a Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3454)|
| 0:57:42| Representative Haynes is in law school, and so that Thursday night is the best night for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| Is that, anybody opposed to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| Would you prefer a dinner over a lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| A lunch kind of puts us within an hour time frame, and this will allow some time to get together and discuss some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| You and Mr. Haynes are treating us to Ruth's Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| I didn't say Ruth's Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| But, no, we're going to see if we can find a place to host everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| and invite the mayor's office and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| We'll go Dutch with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Is it going to be just down the hill there at the Parks and Rec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| Whatever we need to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| We'll find somewhere to have dinner, but we're going to have it a Thursday night sometime in late September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| early October if that's nobody's objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| So, and be thinking about things you want to discuss with your representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| and legislative items for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| I just wanted to get a pulse for Monday's chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| I know at one point we're going to have the finance department come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Mr. Chris is going to come, and he's going to be briefing us on numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| The end of the fiscal year was June 30th, and he's going to he's compiling some numbers for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| So he's going to come and give us a briefing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| And I'm hopeful, too, that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| I haven't talked to Mr. Ballard yet, but I'm going to see if the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| and some others can come in and just kind of give us a forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| Because I think as a funding body, it's good for us to have a good feel for figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| I might even grant Mr. Fox to come from the University of Tennessee business office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| just to kind of give us a feel for the economy and how things look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| So, yes, we are going to do that at the chairman's lunch on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Yes, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| I would just like to comment on the article that was in the Hall Shopper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Don't get too excited about a surplus of $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| That is the trustees' figures, which they use cash-based accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| We use a modified accrual-based accounting, a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| We are ahead of schedule on revenue collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| But the word surplus may be a bad word to use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I think I would use that's the amount that we've exceeded our projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3602)|
| 1:00:11| To me, a surplus is revenue over expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| And I don't think that will be the case of $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| But we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| And most of that will go to schools anyway, because they get the majority of sales tax and property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| So I just don't want you all to get too excited too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| We've got a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| And when you meet with us on Monday, you're going to have a breakdown of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| So we'll have some more firm figures to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Chris, I just had one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| We don't have the numbers yet, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| No, we are still paying accounts payable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| We're still receiving revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| And we really won't know for, what, another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| It will be at least another month before we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| And we can give you, I mean, estimates as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| But we will get probably more hard numbers in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| I assume that article was based strictly on the recent trustees report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| And the trustees report, that is accurate according to the trustees report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| It's just how we accrue certain months in both property tax and sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| No, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Chris, they're not known for their financial savvy anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| A bit more levity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| The September meeting, is that when you said, Commissioner Andrews, September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| No, we would be having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Are you talking about we would meet our legislators on a Thursday in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| No, that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Thursday doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| My birthday is on a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I'm not taking you to dinner twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| No, we'd be having dinner with them on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Is there anything else to come before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120716?start=3720)|
