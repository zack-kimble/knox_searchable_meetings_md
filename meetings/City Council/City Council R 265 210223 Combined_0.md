| 0:09:13| My heart is heavy but hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| I see leaders coming together and sending a strong message that this gun violence must stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| This is not a school problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| This is not a problem in any particular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| It's a community problem, and we all, from families to government, have a role to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| I first want to thank KPD for their critical police work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| We can't do this without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Every day, our officers are out there trying to prevent and investigate crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| Every day, they're out there risking their lives and doing their best to keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| And they do a swift response when there's a violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| In response to the uptick in violence that started months ago, we've done many things, including increased patrols around Austin East and neighborhoods where violence is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=594)|
| 0:10:06| focused on habitual offenders in high-crime areas, and disrupting any future criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| We've increased visibility and enhanced community policing in an effort to have face-to-face interactions with residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| We need to have more relationship building between community and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And I know everyone's working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| We do not conduct random stop-and-frisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| We are stopping individuals when there's reasonable suspicion supported by specific facts that a criminal offense has been or is about to be committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| This has resulted in several arrests and weapons being confiscated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| We're getting criminals off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| More importantly, or equally importantly, is a community response and trying to innovate to stop the violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=646)|
| 0:10:53| For several months now, the Public Safety Innovation Task Force has been working across departments to consider new strategies to keep Knoxville safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=653)|
| 0:11:02| This group includes Deputy Chief Kenny Miller and Captain Coker from KPD, Knoxville Fire Department Chief Compton, as well as Park Executive Director LaKenya Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=662)|
| 0:11:14| and our Community Outreach Manager, who oversees Empower Knox Initiative, Kathy Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| And leading this task force is my Chief Policy Officer, Erin Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| One key focus of this group, which you're going to hear about more tonight, later on the agenda, is how to interrupt violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| Evidence and research is clear that the best strategies for addressing violent crime invest both in law enforcement and community-based programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| So tonight, I'm asking your support for two items to interrupt violent crime and prevent violent crime from happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=700)|
| 0:11:50| One is a $1 million budget amendment for violence interruption efforts. That's item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Another is item 11J. It's an application for a $1 million burn criminal justice innovation program plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| This will help KPD and the community, and we will work together to stop the surge in violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| I look forward to a more complete discussion of this when we get to those agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| I want to thank you all for all of your attention and support and the healing that you are doing to help our community through this difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=733)|

| 0:12:28| I know some of you weren't able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| I want to give a special thanks to Vice Mayor McKenzie, who's been really available to her community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| uniting us to stop the violence, attending many of our prayer circles and sessions to help us stop the violence and start the healing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=758)|
| 0:12:49| There was an incredible show of support at Austin East Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Staff, teachers, administrators, school people, project grad people, community members, prayer services all over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=772)|
| 0:13:01| Efforts are continuing all over the city to keep our children and neighborhoods safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| I know you guys are equally committed to making Knoxville safer and stopping the surge in violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| I look forward to discussing this as we get to these agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| That concludes my mayor's report. I'd like to move on to reports of council members or committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Yes, Mayor. Sadly, in addition to the two tragic deaths that you just mentioned, two days later or so, there was a shooting on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=805)|
| 0:13:37| And I've since learned that the woman who was the victim of that has passed away from those injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| And it's Tamara Lynn and Russell of Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| My heart goes out to her loved ones and condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| And it's just it's a reminder that none of us are immune from this kind of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| And it can happen to any one of us, no matter where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you. Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| I'll just add on that that topic to thank the community members who helped KPD find and arrest the suspect in that homicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=853)|
| 0:14:26| Vice Mayor McKenzie. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| I just want to take a moment and just publicly thank everyone for your prayers and support in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=871)|
| 0:14:40| Also, I want to thank all of those individuals who have been leading community meetings and opportunities for people to speak out and share how they're feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=880)|
| 0:14:50| And also their thoughts around solutions to some of the things that we're experiencing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| And so look forward to all of us working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| I also want to publicly thank WJBE and their Friday Night Fallout crew, along with several other people who helped coordinate a community sound off on last Friday that allowed people from the community to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=899)|
| 0:15:16| And also an opportunity for those folks who are doing some great work in the community and outreach to share what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| I do want to announce that they will be hosting at the Change Center at 6 o'clock this Friday, a similar format for youth speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=923)|
| 0:15:32| Again, there'll be limited capacity due to social distancing and COVID protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| This is for young people. It will be moderated by young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| We will have adults there that will be chaperoning the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| If the student or young person that attends is under 11 years old, the parent will need to stay to accompany them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| And again, that will be Friday at 6 o'clock at the Change Center for our young people to speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| And also, Councilmembers, thank you for everyone who reached out to offer their support and their prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| It is greatly appreciated in the community and the city at this time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Yeah, I would just add that I would echo everybody's statements thus far and just add, you know, that this violence is not limited to a certain place in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=973)|
| 0:16:24| I think just today someone was shot in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| And so similar to Vice Mayor McKenzie's comments and Councilmember Thomas's comments, I think it's important that, you know, this is a very community-oriented problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=987)|
| 0:16:38| It requires community engagement, but we also needed to support KPD in this moment, particularly because they're the ones trying to keep us safe right now in this crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=998)|
| 0:16:49| And so I think it's important we support the first responders, show them some love when you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| They're trying to keep us safe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| It's a big, complicated problem, but I think that the people who are trying to keep peace need our support more now than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| So I want to applaud Chief Thomas, and I know you all are working around the clock, and we're grateful for your safety, for our safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1025)|

| 0:17:39| I just wanted to point out that Keep Knoxville Beautiful is doing the North Knoxville community cleanup, and I think it's a particularly good event to get signed up for this time around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1059)|
| 0:17:52| and get some of the neighborhood and community organizations, church groups signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1072)|

| 0:18:07| And I think it's particularly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| There haven't been a lot of community activities over the last year due to COVID, and this is a great opportunity to get out in a COVID-safe, socially distanced manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1089)|
| 0:18:18| and be able to pick up and clean up some of the litter that has accumulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1098)|

| 0:18:35| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1115)|

| 0:20:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| My name is Tyler Givens, 1823 Explorer Lane, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| I'm going to try not to give one of my trademark breathless rants this time so everybody can go ahead and relax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| And as you can tell, I've also figured out that I can speak on individual agenda items, which I'm very excited by that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| So to the matter at hand, we have been begging in this city for years now for body cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| And right now, before they're rolled out, there's an ordinance to modify the fee schedule on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Now, Ms. Kincannon is right that most videos under the new policy will be less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| However, all over the country, police promise transparency on paper and hide behind qualified immunity, officer safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1239)|
| 0:20:48| and privacy to restrict access to public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Knoxville can and should be better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| The issue with this ordinance is that there is no restrictions or limitations on the fees for redaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| The city policy on redaction of videos is literally one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| Where public records requested include information made confidential under state or federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| the public records request coordinator shall work in coordination with the law department to ensure that confidential information is redacted prior to release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| Now, that doesn't sound too bad, except there's no upper limit on what can be redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| There's a very easy fix to this policy, say where and only where required by state and federal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| so that officers will not be able to spend as many hours as they like redacting as many parts of a video they like to drive up the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| This fee structure is open to abuse, and other city police forces have abused such structures in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| Just recently, the Knox County Sheriff's Office lost a lawsuit just a couple months ago for illegally withholding records that had to do with their cooperation with ICE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1309)|
| 0:22:01| Those records were requested by a UT professor to do a study of what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| and they dragged their feet and dragged their feet and raised the price and took her to court to access these documents that are created with public tax dollars and should be easily available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1325)|
| 0:22:17| That is the point of the open records law, but we are leaving open a loophole that bad actors, bad apples in our police department can use to keep the public from accessing records that we have rights to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1337)|
| 0:22:30| Now, the mayor mentioned that there's no fee for in-person record viewing, and that's great, but our policy doesn't talk about redaction there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| It doesn't make any sense to charge by the hour for redaction on copied videos and say we're not going to redact those videos if someone caused abuse in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1359)|
| 0:22:50| This ordinance is short, it is sloppy, it is half-baked, and our policy is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| And again, we can and should do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| I beg you to remember that you are the only people in the city that can hold the police accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| There's no footage of Philly feet, there's no footage of the killing of Ron Cardin or Brandon Lambert or Jason McKinnick, all people shot to death by the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1387)|
| 0:23:20| Think of Breonna Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Think of what Louisville is going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| There were no body cams there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| We don't want our city to go through what they're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| We want to believe that our cops are the good guys, and perhaps most of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| But you have a responsibility to protect the rights of the citizens in your care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Ms. Parker, Ms. Singh, thank you very much for your excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| The rest of you, I hope I can thank you some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| I yield back the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you, Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| The next person I have to speak to this is Mr. Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Mr. Roach, are you on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Mr. Roach, if you could just start by stating your name and address for the record, and then you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Good evening, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| Rick Roach, 1912 Victoria Avenue, 27915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| I speak in agreement with the sentiments that Tyler expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1458)|
| 0:24:27| About October 2019 at the park meeting, when Chief Thomas was speaking concerning the testing phase of body cams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1467)|
| 0:24:43| one of the things that was brought up, and I spoke to it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| and I believe at the time, Mayor, you were at that meeting also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| but I spoke to about who was going to have access to video records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| and what that whole process would entail, especially if there would be a cost involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| And Chief Thomas agreed that, yes, we will consider all those things and look into those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| But my feeling is on this, anyone that wants to have access to these records, they're already paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1516)|
| 0:25:24| Taxpayer dollars have already paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| So there should be no need to charge a fee for someone to request access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| And on the redaction part of this, you know, we should have some civilian input as to what would be redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1533)|
| 0:25:44| There should be no charging or fees associated with anything regarding redaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1544)|
| 0:25:53| That fee structure shouldn't even be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| So I think that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| I hope you all realize that, you know, these are records that can help destroy someone's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1559)|
| 0:26:08| or, you know, show their innocence or anything of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| Use normal common sense in order to protect the privacy of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| But, yeah, we don't need to be paying for information that's already been paid for, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1580)|
| 0:26:28| And so that's my sentiment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Council members, is there any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| Mr. Swanson, do you have something to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Yeah, I just wanted to respond a little bit to the speakers, and I understand what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| However, what we're talking about here is the release of public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| And as the mayor indicated, they are welcome to come in and view those public records without charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| It's only when we have to produce a public record that the charge will be assessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| and it will only be a charge that is related to what it costs us to produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| So that's what the state law allows, and that's all we'll be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| You should know that the officers do not do redactions of the films.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| That's done by a technician, and it's done in consultation with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| And we only redact that which the law requires us to redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| We only redact the things that state law or federal law require us to redact from a public record before it is released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1655)|
| 0:27:46| There is no redaction beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| So I just want the public to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| And so what you really have here is primarily a reduction in the amount fees will be charged to the public in accessing public records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1671)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Mr. Swanson, is there a policy or an ordinance that governs or states clearly the redaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1687)|
| 0:28:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| That you just described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| That we only redact what the state law or the federal law requires us to redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| We don't redact beyond what we are absolutely compelled to redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| So I missed one of your words due to the Zoom world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Did you say there's a policy or there's an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Well, there's not an ordinance, but we have to follow the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Oh, it's the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| The state law dictates what you can and cannot redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| It's the open records law that tells us what not only we can redact is what we must redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| It tells us what we have to redact from public records before they're released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| And we only redact or only allowed to redact those things that are required by law to be redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1746)|
| 0:29:15| And if someone believes more has been redacted than what is allowed, what would they be able to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1755)|
| 0:29:23| If they file a grievance with PARC, what would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| They could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| There are a number of ways to address that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Ultimately, they could go to court and ask the court to review the entire unredacted section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| and make sure that we have not redacted anything beyond what the law requires us to redact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| Obviously, we would not want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| We would explain what we've redacted and why we've redacted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| But ultimately, if you ended up in a disagreement about whether it's something that the law does, in fact, require be redacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| then there would be a lawsuit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Mr. Swanson, for those of us that aren't as well versed in state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| can you give me an example of what types of things must be required to be redacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| I think that might help all of us kind of understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| I don't expect you to know it chapter and verse, but just a couple of examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Well, I don't, but Ron Mills knows the chapter and verse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| He's on this call if we need to resort to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| But it's the kind of thing like we have to blur the face of a minor who's shown in a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| If there's private information that is otherwise prohibited from being disclosed, it might be financial records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1844)|
| 0:30:54| It might be a number of other things that the law requires that we maintain the privacy of the individual with regard to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1854)|
| 0:31:03| It might be those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| And if you want a complete listing, I'll be glad to refer to Ron and let him give you a complete list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| Council Member Fugate, do you have a general idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| But I do think when we talk about what we're legally required to redact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| the average community member doesn't have any idea what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| I appreciated the comments from the community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| When I first read this ordinance, you know, I appreciated the intentions behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| But also thought that the way it was written, some request could potentially, you know, go over $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| It's not a set fee any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| So what I would like to propose is or I'd really just like to make a motion that we amend this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1918)|
| 0:32:10| and just add in the language up to $50 so that we can make sure that there's a cap on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| and this new fee structure does not go above our previous fee amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| So you're making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Can you state it in like the motion form, sort of like you want to make a motion to put a cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I don't want to put words in your mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| I just want to make sure if you could just restate it so we have the motion right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Make a motion to amend the ordinance to include language up to $50 so that there is a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1961)|
| 0:32:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Council Member Parker is making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| It sounds like it looks like our Law Director has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| I'm certainly willing to wait on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| If there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Motion made to amend the ordinance to add language that puts a cap of $50 on the fees made by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| Council Member Parker, seconded by Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| Law Director, please tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| I just want to say a couple of things about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| One of which is it's really, I think, quite true that the vast majority of requests would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| be now way less than $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| But even though that may be true, there's two things I need to say, one of which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2018)|
| 0:33:46| anybody who wants to see a public record is entitled to see that public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And they can see it for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| They can come in and they can look at the entire public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| No matter how long it takes to look at that public record, we will make that available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| for viewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| However, if they want a copy of it, if they want some, we've got to prepare the necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| videotape in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| And if somebody requests hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of tape, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| takes our people hours and hours and hours and hours of preparation time, because so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| much has been requested in a single request, then the state law provides for the charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| And frankly, they are charges that should be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| So, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Typically, the request that would come in for hours of tape, would that be related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2083)|
| 0:34:53| court cases, not just an individual person just wanting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Is that more in line with someone needing that for court cases, such as attorneys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| Or do we have any history on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Mr. Swanson, and then Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| I think I'm going to defer to Ron Mills on that question, because he's the one who dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| with the vast majority of these records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| And so, I'd ask Ron to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| Mr. Mills, could you shed some light on this for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Okay, I'll handle the first part of it, and I'll probably need a repeat on the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| It would apply to court cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| However, there is a limitation on the availability of cases of videos where cases are ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| They are available through the District Attorney's Office, but otherwise, the courts have placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| a limitation on who can access those videos, and therefore, there's a number of videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2146)|
| 0:35:55| just because of the nature of an ongoing criminal case would not be available to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| regardless until that case is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| I think that answers the first part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| What was the second part again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| So, basically, the majority of the requests would be related to court cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| I don't know that I could say it's the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| I would have to let KPD respond on that, but there are a number of situations where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| not an active criminal prosecution where someone might request a copy of a video, an encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| with a police officer, for instance, attorneys working on civil litigation, trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| a witness statement from the scene of a traffic crash, for instance, an individual who just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| wanted to review, as I said, an encounter with a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| There are a number of situations that aren't necessarily evidential with regard to criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| cases, so it's hard to say what the percentage is that actually would not be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| But that's a question that KPD is used to dealing with because they've been dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| with videos and availability of videos based on court cases for 20 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Last question before we move on to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Could someone else, other than the person who was involved in the video, request the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| video from a certain incident even if they were not involved in the incident without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| the person's consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| If there's no ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution, the answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| If I wanted to do a random sample of videos for a particular area, a particular officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| anything of that nature, as long as there's no criminal investigation ongoing or no criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| prosecution ongoing, then those are considered public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| As Mr. Swanson said, you do have to apply those confidential provisions from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| And as far as those confidential things that are redacted, you start out with the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| things that are redacted from a paper document, social security numbers, driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| numbers, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| And then you overlay that videos taken inside health care facilities are exempt under state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| As Mr. Swanson said, minors, when they're taken within a school, for instance, minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| crimes where a child is a victim of a minor crime, you redact certain information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| And also you redact video from the inside of an individual's home when that home is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| not a crime scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| And that's covered by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| So you overlay these video requirements along with what's already out there for paper documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| that we've seen for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| As it relates to a service, to a fee, but if I were to come into the office and request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2329)|
| 0:38:56| that footage, I could look at it there at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| You'd need to be able to provide a description such that the technician could pull up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| particular video that you're looking for, just like you would for a paper document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| But that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| They should be able to cue that up and show it to you, as long as there's no redaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| that has to happen before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| It's going to take a while to make a required redaction if you just walk in and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| can I see this piece of video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Mr. Mills, if you know, suppose someone from the public came in and they watched several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| hours of video free, and then they made a request that they didn't need the entire several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| hours, they just needed one segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| Is it feasible that the technicians there could give them that one segment and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| charge them accordingly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I believe that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| You just need to be able to identify the particular segment you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| So, if you could do by time stamp or something of that nature, that should not be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Question for Mr. Swanson or Mr. Mills even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| If they are not comfortable with a $50 cap, I was curious if there was a cap that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| would be comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Mr. Mills, do you know if other entities have caps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| I don't know how other entities deal with that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| I would say that's ultimately not a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| I mean, I think that's something that probably would be best handled by Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| Well, another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| When we had our or under our previous fee structure with $50 being the amount, how have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2463)|
| 0:41:13| these issues been handled in the past where, you know, you may feel like a large request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| takes hours of time to pull together, but we still have this $50 fee for CDs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| Well, that's $50 per recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| So, and actually the way it has worked out as a practical matter, if you've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2490)|
| 0:41:39| earlier police videos that are on DVD, what you typically see would be snippets of video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| for a particular time period based on when the officer's camera was activated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| So, you may have five or six different recordings within a period of, say, a half hour, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| all those are considered to be essentially one recording because they'll fit on one DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| So, you're talking about $50 per recording there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Now, if there are a number of officers on the scene, you would be looking at a $50 charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| for every officer on the scene for every one of those recordings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| I don't know exactly how the, I've never seen the interface, but it strikes me that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| something that would be a whole lot simpler to deal with when, with the new system with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| regard to pulling off individual recordings and making those available either for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| in person or online and essentially providing a download link online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| So, under our new system, with our new technology, it would be easier to share, but we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2556)|
| 0:42:44| change our fee structure to allow an ability to charge more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| I'm just, I'm confused now about the need to change the fee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| Well, the change in the fee structure is actually decreasing the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| The vast majority of these video requests are going to be, are going to come in at around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| $10 because that's what you're going to be looking at for the cost to actually make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| recording and provide the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| You don't have to handle the DVDs or anything of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| The only time you're going to be seeing higher fees than that are when it takes longer time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| to process the videos for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| And that could be from the total amount of information that has to be redacted, the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2604)|
| 0:43:33| where part of the video is related to a criminal prosecution and part of it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| It's hard to speculate exactly why there would be an additional, an exceptional amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| time required to process the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| But I think you're going to see, I think Chief Thomas has already seen this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| I think you're going to see that most of the videos are going to come in at $10 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| recording as opposed to the $50 that people have been paying up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Thank you, Mr. Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Council Member Fugett had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| We'll go to her and if you have more questions, we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Council Member Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| It sounds to me like, Mr. Mills, that $50 was not a cap for everything you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| $50 was a cap per incident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| You mean in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| In the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| In the past, that was basically per officer per recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| So, you know, if you wanted to see an hour's worth of video for an officer, then that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| be certainly captured on one DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| So, that would be $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I would point out that you also had to have redaction at that point also, but that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| kind of baked into the charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Now, the redaction time is not baked into the charge for the first $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| And so, that would be something that would be addressed on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| But otherwise, you're still looking at, if you're looking for three officers on a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| scene, you're looking at three different recordings, that would be $30 versus $150 as to what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| have been charged in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Any other questions about the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| My concern is I'm imagining that people are asking for the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Oftentimes, they are victims or suspicious about what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| So, I don't want to limit them or, you know, the more video they want, I want them to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| But I also don't want people to take advantage of that and, you know, it has to be within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| So, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Is Chief Thomas on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Council Member Singh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I know we were talking about that oftentimes it's lawyers who are requesting this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| are there oftentimes citizens requesting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| And how have those requests gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Are they very long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Have there been issues in them figuring out what portion that they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| I don't want them to get extra fees because they're trying to search out if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| remember exactly the identifying information to get the right video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| So, for the most part, when we have a citizen make a request, it's over a single incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| a parent on a traffic stop on a child, somebody's own traffic stop, or maybe a complaint that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| they thought the officer might not have acted correctly and they want their own copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| So, what we really tried to do, believe it or not, was make it cheaper for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| because the software makes it easier for us to get the video now rather than having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| download it to a disk and handle those disks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| And to be quite frank, a lot of people don't even have disk drives anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| So, sometimes it's hard for somebody to find some place to play that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| But, yeah, for the most, and I'm sure there's exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| I can't think of any right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| But for the most part, it was always done on one disk and the charge would be just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| $10 as opposed to the $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| The biggest requests I can think of, and I apologize I don't have a tech services person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| here with me that could address this specifically, are maybe from litigators or insurance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| or media requests that have to do with certain incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| And the media, you will usually come in and view the video first and then ask for just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| the specific pieces they want and then it's just the $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| I may have gotten in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Yeah, I know it was a vague question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| I'm just, like I said, I'm trying to prevent that if there's a citizen who doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| have a memory of the date it was, the time it was, and so they may need to, they may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| request a lot of material to try to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| That's where I'm thinking I wouldn't want them to be limited financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| Yeah, and normally when something like that would happen, we would try to find that incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| We're not going to charge them for 15 hours of videotape when it's a five-minute interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| If they can give us some basics, we could find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| But yes, we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| That's not anything different than we do when somebody calls in a complaint or a commendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| and we take a look real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| I just wanted to add that, you know, the purpose of my amendment was just to try to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2939)|
| 0:49:08| we captured what we're hearing as the intention behind this change so that we have good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2948)|
| 0:49:17| And I hear that, you know, those who will be carrying out this function of getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| data to the community is very willing to, you know, be flexible and work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2965)|
| 0:49:33| But I think it's really important that as City Council, we make sure that those intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| are reflected in this policy so that, you know, future administrations are clear on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| what the expectation is from City Council's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And we want to ensure that this remains accessible and affordable to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| So I would like for us to consider, you know, some sort of cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| The way it reads is regarding video recordings and the cost for each recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3001)|
| 0:50:09| So it seems like if we put a cap on the cost of each recording, similar to the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| fee structure, that does not prevent KPD or the law department from requiring for charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3015)|
| 0:50:25| for multiple recordings as was done previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| We just want to make sure that that one recording, as was the case previously, remains affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| to some degree and doesn't exceed that $50 cap that was previously in place for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| individual recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Are you withdrawing your First Amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Are you trying to change your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Because that's a little different from your First Amendment, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| No, it's the same amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| I just wanted to clarify the reasoning behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Any further questions or comments on the amendment before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Just Chief Thomas or Mr. Swanson, what would be the impact of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| The impact, are you asking financially or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| What would be the, just overall, what would be the impact of capping individual recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| requests to $50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| So the only fear I have in that is if someone comes in and says, I want all of a whole day's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| worth of an officer's recordings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| And then we have to go through and, excuse me, my light went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| So then we end up redacting a whole 10-hour shift, which would take quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| You know, if they're looking for a specific incident, we can find that and just take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| specific incident out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| It seems like in that situation, if someone wanted all 10 hours of an officer's shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| that would be multiple recordings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Because we don't have the technology that will create 10-hour long recordings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| They're going to be snippets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| My understanding of this new system is that it sends out those videos in a link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| So, yes, they could be very long, rather than like on a CD where you have a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| of hours that you could put on one CD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| It's a video link now that is sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| And that's for a full 24-hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| Well, we've not been asked to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| I'm assuming you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| I mean, it seems like we're making policy before we even know how the technology fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| And so now I'm really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| I mean, we don't know how different the fee schedule is from our previous one because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| the technology works so differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| I can speak to our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| So, you know, if you want to leave the policy the way it is, our intent was to make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| on people, make it cheaper, because it was for the simple clips for the vast majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| we get, reducing that $50 charge to $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| That was the intent on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| Council members, I think Chief Thomas brings up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| The whole intent of this is we do have body cameras that are in place or almost in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| There's going to be more transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| That's good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| That's good for the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| We're reducing the cost that it takes for people who want to have access to the videos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| without coming into the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| This is good news for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| It's controlled by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| We are just making things better for public safety in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| That's sort of a simplification of what we're trying to share with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| Council Member Testament, did you have a comment or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| I was just going to say, I mean, it goes back as far as the accessibility for those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| might not be able to afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| I mean, it's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| I mean, if people, through very little effort, want to go in person, it's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| But also, if it requires a great deal of time and effort, I mean, you know, it's people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| And time is money at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| And I think there has to be some kind of charge for that kind of time spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Council Member Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| So we have a motion on the floor to cap it at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| And then we have a motion to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| The motion to cap it at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| The motion on the floor is an amendment to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| It's my understanding to cap it at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| And I'm not sure if that's a single video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| I'm a little confused about what the cap is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| So I think I understand what Councilwoman Parker is getting at as a per recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| But I think the concern is that it could be an entire 10-hour shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| And because the body cams are required, Chief Thomas, if you could clarify for me, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| required to go on at the beginning of your shift and off at the end of your shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| They're required to have them on during citizen interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| But we have those redundancies built in like when a door opens, that camera automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| comes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So some officers will leave them on the entire shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| They're not required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| But they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=3383)|

| 1:20:23| between the 5th District and my sister district over in the 4th. And so we are really excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| about this project. It's been kind of quite a while in the works, but really looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| to it. And I would like to call on Director Cannon, if I could. Director Cannon, could you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=4835)|

| 1:31:00| Yes, ma'am. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5460)|

| 1:31:09| Yes, I'm here. Can y'all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Yes. You can start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5471)|

| 1:31:21| So I do support this initiative. As we have all expressed even at the beginning of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| conversation, gun violence has went crazy in Knoxville. However, for those of you all who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| are Knoxville natives particularly, we also know that this is no new thing. This is not a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| Gun violence has been rampant in our communities for a very, very long time. And it kind of ties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5497)|
| 1:31:43| back to the budget. This is why we get so outraged by $60 million budgeted into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| police departments, especially for new buildings when you have a community that is rampant with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| gun violence. Now, the thing about the grant, I want to also express how important it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| this grant money really goes towards the gun violence. No hands in the cookie jar, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| Nobody's going to find a way to reallot or reappoint this money. No need to find another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| way to redirect it to something else. All this money needs to come into East Knoxville. Between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| the two grants by math, it's almost $2.5 million. And I want people to understand something. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| money is for the community because the students and the staff are expressed. The problem of Austin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| East High School is just that. It's not the AE school. It is the community, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| the school sits in. But what has happened in our community? We've had a lot of gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| We've had a loss of revenue and entrepreneurship, workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| those types of things. Youth enrichment is definitely quite absent compared to what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| was when I was growing up as a child at East Knoxville. It's just several factors to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| And so I do want to ensure that we get this money into our communities and put these cameras up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| not just around Austin East. We know that on Wilson and Castle, there's been a history of gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| violence. We know around Chestnut Park, there's a history of gun violence. We know going all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| down to Walter P, all through Ben Harrington, everywhere, there is a history of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| So to me, cameras need to go all through these areas that we are fully aware of where gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| violence has been persistent and prevalent. As well as the fact, yes, we do need more patrolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| officers on our streets. But the catch is, again, not just around the school, but in the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| where we know these gun violence incidents are taking place. Selma, Sunset, again, well-known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| areas that have held gun violence for many years in our community. As well as the fact, we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| need to see youth enrichment, and we need our police officers to really engage in a true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| community relationship. Like I said, you know I know Officer Dave's name because Officer Dave was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| in my community faithfully. He came into our schools with the D.A.R.E. program, and when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| wasn't doing D.A.R.E., he was riding around the neighborhoods, walking around the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| shaking hands, and well-engaged with his community. That requires several officers that we know by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| name to come into our community and do the same. That is something that's going to have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| Are we being serious about this? Are we playing with this? That's a real question all of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| including myself, need to ask. Because at this point, I'm holding us all accountable. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| accountable because I could have done more, too. You're accountable because you definitely could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| have done more, too. The teachers, necessarily not so much, or the students, but the parents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| other factors are. The pieces of our community are all accountable. And this is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| where money comes in, and I want to ensure that money goes directly to the core of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| which is gun violence, which we already know that gun violence is tied to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Poverty. So there's another opportunity to address something that's also detrimenting our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| community, which is our poverty rate. Forty-two percent before COVID were living in a poverty rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| particularly your African-American community. This is a real chance to really do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| become proactive and reactive, obviously, because we're going to have to react now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| so we can be proactive from here on out towards our engagement by really being precise and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| point with the funding. This is critical. We're upset as a community because we feel like y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| have been photo-opting us for the last several days and several weeks with this matter. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| this is an opportunity where you can show us it's not a photo-op. You are serious about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| problems in the community and really trying to be solution and resolution oriented by bringing us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| the children, and everybody else to the room, to the table. This is not going to be solved by one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5720)|

| 1:35:30| more parents in my community with their faces and their hearts broken because we're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| children in boxes. Keep in mind, we still have feeder schools over there. We got green school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| we got Semo Green, and we got Bonds. I don't want to see no 10-year-old, no 11-year-old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| and no 8-year-old in a box. I think we can all agree to that. We don't want to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| So I want to reiterate, this money needs to go directly into the community, directly towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| solving the problems of the community surrounding gun violence. Again, no hands in the cookie jar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5753)|

| 1:36:11| already. All of these things have already been served. So as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| there's no reason for this money to go anywhere besides the community unless you want to invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5775)|

| 1:36:45| would be implemented. There have been concerns raised by folks on every side of the political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5805)|

| 1:37:09| And what they were finding, what the studies were finding, were that there were incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5829)|
| 1:37:18| embedded within the grant program that were encouraging police departments to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5838)|
| 1:37:26| their number of arrests without showing that those arrests were leading to a decrease in violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5846)|

| 1:38:22| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5902)|
| 1:38:29| Okay. Sorry, it took me a second. First of all, this is not a JAG grant. This is a burn grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| And I'm not sure it was available last year, but I can tell you to that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| in the past couple of years, we have hired some planning and grants folks that have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| very well at ferreting out grants that will be useful to the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| So the burn grant is designed, and I'll read this directly from, with priorities focusing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| reducing serious and violent crime, including gun violence, dismantling gang activity, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| strengthening the local capacity to combat drug abuse. So those are the things that we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| targeting. We have to show that our plan will target those things in order to receive funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| for this grant. And they'll come in, I believe it's on a quarterly basis, and check us to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| sure we're using the funding for that. So right now, our ideas for this money, and again, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| just, your approval is just for us to apply for this grant. This does not guarantee we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| to get this money. It's a million dollars over three years. So it's actually a three-year grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| But what we are looking at doing is, again, some cameras, improving some technology where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| fallen behind software to identify patterns in crime and offenders. We're thinking about partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5982)|
| 1:39:53| with maybe some type of doorbell cameras that we could give to the community members who want, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| would like them. We also want to do a focus on gang violence and look at gang education programs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| we could put in our schools and, you know, our children's after-school providers for adults and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| children as well. Because we need to make everybody aware what this looks like and when it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| what it looks like and how to recognize it. So we can combat this. So those are the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| things that we want to do with this. And again, you know, it's a three-year grant. It is not a JAG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| grant. It is a burn grant. Does that kind of give you an overview or any more specific questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6031)|
| 1:40:39| No, that's helpful. My understanding of the program is it's called the Burn JAG Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| Program. So the information that I have has concerns about this burn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6046)|
| 1:40:54| funding. The other question I have is in terms of this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| what data is KPD required to track and share with, to carry out this grant funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| That I don't have a good handle on. It would depend on what we tell them we are looking to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| with the money. Like if we are going to have a gang education program, they would want to, want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| us to show them what type of program we're interested in and how we would administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| that program and what funding that would require. And they do, they come in and check us. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| we have to dot our I's and cross our T's. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6091)|
| 1:41:38| Mayor. Vice Mayor McKenzie. Thank you. Thank you, Chief Thomas. And it's good to hear that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6098)|
| 1:41:46| have a person, a staff member that is specifically looking for grants and grant funding to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6106)|
| 1:41:53| some violence and hopefully some violence prevention type tactics. I would ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| would please keep us, if this passes, that you'd keep us abreast of the progress. And if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| if we approve for this grant, as I really feel like there is a great need for some preventive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| services as well. And I think that we'll get into that on the next item as well. But just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| ask if you'll please keep us posted whether or not we get the grant or not, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| Thank you. Definitely. And part of what we're proposing is a big community outreach. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| you will definitely hear from us because we'll need a lot. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| Vice Mayor. Council Members, I just wanted to clarify, and this is in your packet, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| is a Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Grant. It's not an Edward Byrne JAG grant. So, those are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| different things. And this is the Criminal Justice Innovation Grant. So, there's more information in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6162)|
| 1:42:50| your packet. And Chief Thomas answered some of the questions. Are there any more questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| discussion? Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote. Vice Mayor McKenzie? Yes. Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6173)|

| 1:43:21| Yes. Motion carries 9-0. Council Members, I'd like to call a 10-minute recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| in the interest of our good health. So, let's reconvene at 7-53, please. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| almost everybody's back. We'll go ahead and reconvene and we'll resume. Please, Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6214)|
| 1:43:43| I think we're on K. Yes, ma'am. 11-K is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6223)|

| 1:44:12| approve. Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| Any questions? Oh, we have someone who signed up to speak to this. Constance Every, are you on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| call? Yep, still here. Okay. You have up to five minutes to address Council. All right. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6262)|
| 1:44:32| same thing. This money needs to go towards what it is project and projected for. As we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6272)|
| 1:44:38| yes, in our children, a lot of the issues that we are dealing with does start on social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| or some form of Internet platform. So, again, I agree with this. We do need to have better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| monitoring of our children and what they're doing online. However, again, the money needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| to go towards the children and the Internet usage. This is, again, like I said, another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| where it doesn't have to be so criminalization-like. We can look at programs like Candace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Hulbert's Yo STEM. She has a program that is dedicated strictly to that technology and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| that looks like moving forward. So, at the same time as we monitor our children, we can absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| encourage our children into these fields and career fields to be part of the future law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| enforcement or other technical agencies that do this type of work. So, it still stands for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| same principle. The money that comes in towards the gun violence and how we can directly and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| indirectly impact that problem needs to truly go towards that. Like I said, no hands in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| cookie jar. If anything, if you are going to invest any money away from this grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| to something else, it will have to go to Homicide Department. I spoke to our homicide detectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| and they tell me that they are inadequately technicalized with their equipment, it's out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| of date, and that they lack personnel. They tell me that they are one of the most underfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| departments in the police department. Now, given the fact that we lack some transparency in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| police budgeting to see how it really breaks down, I can't confirm that if that's true or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| without probably digging and getting things like Freedom of Information Act submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| so we can really see the police breakdown and how much money yearly homicide is receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| But it's quite clear, drugs is not the top priority, homicide is. And so, again, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| are going to use any money away from this, it should go directly into homicide, which directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| impacts the problem that we're dealing with, which is the gun violence. I don't really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| anything else that I can really think of particularly at this time to additional add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| Oh, yeah, I do. The other factor is, like it was mentioned before, these things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| getting ready to do, I don't want to see police officers attacking the innocent community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| It's already been stated tonight in this meeting that the majority of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| does not commit these crimes. It is a very select few. And I know many times the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| has given information to police. I would like to see police not take these tips as irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| I've had some family members say that. I think police departments should treat every single tip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| as if it is valid until it is checked out not being valid. We should not be dismissive in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| platform to these family victims and especially to these children who are brave enough to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| forward and identify the individuals who are doing these crimes. I think that's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| that we empower them in this time. If anything, this is the moment where we show them as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| adults. We do care and we do care about their lives and their livelihood and their ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| to grow up and be functional and productive humans to our society. And so that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| else that I want to bring forward. And I also want to bring forward that if it is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| the police department for Chief Thomas, if you're still in this call, if it is true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| detectives are telling the killers or the shooters, the individuals who are being witnesses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| Ms. Evans, this is when you speak, when you sign up to speak on a particular agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| you have to speak, you know, keep your comments to that agenda item. It's all different from public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| forum. I have the privilege to tell you what I cannot do because you came to a funeral that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| you were not invited to. And that still is the issue. Yes. So save face while you can. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| So if it is true that the police department is giving tips away to the shooters of who's telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| them information, that is scary. And that's part of the reason why the police department is lacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| information because the children are scared for their safety. I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| Thank you, Council Member. That concludes everybody who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Just for the record, I, of course, would never go to a funeral without a family member's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| invitation. So that is why I attended the funeral of Stanley Freeman Jr. today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| So the resolution is 11K. It's been a motion to approve. And second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| Council Member Parker, you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| I just wanted to emphasize with this funding and previous funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| because I actually have more questions came to mind on the previous grant now that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6523)|

| 1:48:58| and that this is a citywide problem. And I want to make sure that these are solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6538)|
| 1:49:05| or tools that are going to be implemented citywide. And we don't have any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6545)|

| 1:49:27| that for both of these. Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6567)|

| 1:50:16| for other departments who would like to become involved. We were the first in the state to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6616)|

| 1:50:46| warrants for the data and making the arrests. And it is detectives and officers who are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| this. And it requires a lot of training and a lot of equipment. And I think federally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| they realize this. It goes across state lines. And so this is the five-year grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| the $1.2 million for five years. But that's why that money is involved, so much money is involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6662)|

| 1:52:56| We know that treating gun violence as a public health crisis is a proven model for addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| the crisis. Imagine you're a doctor in an ER and someone comes in bleeding from a gunshot wound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6781)|

| 1:53:22| with education. But what do you do first? If you're that doctor and that person is in danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| of losing their life, you do whatever you can to stop the bleeding. So that means we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=6808)|

| 2:01:14| What we have seen is that, you know, long-standing efforts, including Save Our Sons and Empower Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| and their engagement around enrichment programs and really important youth-serving organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| in our community has begun the hard work of addressing those root causes, but we have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| seen as much of, in the City's perspective, that critical community-based interruption work. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| what I want to be very clear is that there are a lot of programs in the community that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| working, and these community-based programs are doing everything from hospital interventions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7303)|
| 2:01:49| community mediation, and they exist, but they are ad hoc. And to the person who spoke's credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7309)|
| 2:01:56| oftentimes they have not been as closely coordinated with our team here at the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| And so what this budget amendment allows us to do is start forging those really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| connections between that work. I'm going to talk specifically about several specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| community-based strategies and programs that we are looking at supporting with these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| and I want to be clear that these strategies complement but don't replace the important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| focused deterrence work that KPD is leading and has led, as well as other strategies, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7341)|
| 2:02:27| that are core to KPD's mission to prevent respondent criminal activity. But as we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| heard from folks who have spoken today, as well as other members who have spoken with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| the evidence is very clear that when done well, community-based strategies can really make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| difference. That's backed up by national research, promoted by numerous criminal justice and gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| violence networks. So the three pieces that I want to talk a little bit about today, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| can go into additional detail as you'd like, but I want to emphasize three core types of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| We see immediate potential to move forward on in Knoxville, building on some, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| some of this existing work that's happening already in our community. The first is a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7387)|
| 2:03:12| violence reduction strategy, and sometimes you might hear this referred to as an Operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| Ceasefire or maybe a call-in. And so this is, again, a very targeted way to identify the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7397)|
| 2:03:24| individuals and groups that are at the highest risk of being victims of or perpetuating gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| violence and engages them in direct communication. It informs them of the risks and says, let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7409)|
| 2:03:35| help you get out of this situation. But it also is very clear about the penalties of if gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7415)|
| 2:03:41| continues and if you engage in violent crime, that we're going to be very clear about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| intention to prosecute and hold you accountable for those crimes. The second strategy, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7426)|
| 2:03:53| that we have seen some efforts emerge in our community around that we want to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| exploring and really lean into is street outreach. And these are trained violence interrupters and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| street outreach workers. So sometimes they're called the peacemakers. They go by different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| names in different communities. But these are trained and I don't want to use the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| professional because I think as someone alluded to that can maybe have a different commentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| but they are highly trained and this is their job. This is what they do. And so in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| communities, what we have seen work very well is when these outreach workers work with the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| risk individuals, they provide conflict mediation and they do the critical work of actually getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| in front of some of those conflicts. They can also provide outreach and services to help connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| individuals with jobs and other opportunities, again, to get someone out of that life that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| lead them to commit or be a victim of violent crime. The third strategy that we see a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7488)|
| 2:04:54| potential for in Knoxville is hospital-based violence intervention. And again, similar to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| street outreach, these are highly trained intervention specialists. Someone, again, whose job it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| from the community to provide that crisis intervention after an incident has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| So again, these are strategies that we see elements of in our community already and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| to be very clear that we know that there are folks that we will be working with who are already here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| and we want to build upon that work and forge those connections so that this work can become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| more systematic and ultimately coordinated in such a way that it can maximize its effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7525)|
| 2:05:33| So I will pause there because I don't want to throw so much information at you, but those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| some of the key violence interruption community-based strategies we want to explore. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7537)|
| 2:05:42| will also acknowledge that we also plan to launch a Crime Stoppers program. Crime Stoppers is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7542)|
| 2:05:48| national network that works specifically to involve communities in a fight against crime and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7548)|
| 2:05:55| it's kind of a very narrow way of providing truly third-party and fully anonymous tips. And so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7555)|
| 2:06:04| offers reward opportunities, but really make sure that there is a trusted place where tips can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| provided and there's no question that an identity would come back to an individual. So it removes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| some of that fear of providing a tip. So those are the strategies that we want to engage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| and again the violence interruption work around those community-based strategies really being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| the focal point because we know they work in other cities and when done well, which we think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| do here, they can they really have been proven to be effective and it's backed up both by evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| as well as the information that we have heard from community members who are involved in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7592)|
| 2:06:37| I think that's very helpful and I guess I just wanted to get a sense for some of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| you're looking at. As I read the amendment here, it looks like what we're doing is we're setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| aside a fund that you can draw down from as you're funding these programs, but in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| council will be seeing the specifics of these programs as you're starting to put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| Is that right? That's exactly right. Yep. Okay. That is right. I will acknowledge that one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7621)|
| 2:07:08| the things that we want to do very quickly and depending on timing, it may be that this shows up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7628)|
| 2:07:13| on March 9th, but we would like to enter into a contract right away to work with Cities United,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7633)|
| 2:07:19| which is one of the core networks that we have a long history with. They have a team of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| actually here on the call today if you'd like to learn about more about our past work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| but we do intend to work with them pretty quickly so that we can have an on-the-ground program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| coordinator who works with us and helps provide truly technical assistance. I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| we're not outsourcing this work to them, but they work with us and support our staff here at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| city in facilitating those conversations with community groups and bringing that network of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| folks who are working on these issues together to understand what we can build on and what the path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| forward ought to look like for Knoxville specifically. Very good. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| Thank you. I just want to elaborate briefly on what Ms. Gill said. We have looked at and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| will continue to look at best practices and success stories in other cities around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| but we have to make sure it works for Knoxville, and we have to make sure it works with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| here in Knoxville, the community people, boots on the ground who are doing the work. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| we are going to get help from Cities United and technical assistance from them, but the work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| relationships and effort is going to come from right here in the city of Knoxville, the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7706)|
| 2:08:31| who know the people who are struggling with these issues of violence. So, I just want to assure you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| we're not going to just say, oh, they did this in Boston, let's bring it here. That's not how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| works. To make it effective, it has to fit our city, our Knoxville. Same. Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7722)|
| 2:08:53| Thank you, Mayor. We've been having a lot of conversations about this, and I'm very happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| that we are beginning this now instead of thinking about doing this next year. Last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7741)|
| 2:09:08| year would have been better, but we are where we are. My concern is, this is just the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7748)|
| 2:09:17| of the work. This is $1 million. I think there are a lot of programs that are going to need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7757)|
| 2:09:24| be funded. You know, we've talked about that this is a triage. I see the $1 million as working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7764)|
| 2:09:32| what, you know, the most important issues right now, but this can't just be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7772)|
| 2:09:39| we look at the surface level, and if the gun rate goes down, we drop it. This is something that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7779)|
| 2:09:46| very deeply entrenched, not just in Knoxville, all over the country. We need something that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7786)|
| 2:09:54| long-term solution working on it, and it can't just be housed in the city. It has to include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7794)|
| 2:10:02| community. I'm hoping that when funding is being determined on which programs, that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7802)|
| 2:10:12| decision won't be happening just from the city, that there will be other people involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| Ms. Gill, you had said that there are highly trained individuals working in, I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| mentioned with hospital trauma work. These are people that are in Knoxville. Can you tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7825)|
| 2:10:33| about that? I'm not familiar with that. Well, I'll share that where I was speaking of was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| the best practice of hospital-based violence intervention, and in those cases, again, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| research has shown works best is when the folks who are engaged in that work are highly trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| again, both at conflict mediation, but they have the training to understand how to deal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7850)|
| 2:10:57| crisis that being in a hospital after a shooting entails. That being said, we do have folks in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7857)|
| 2:11:06| network here in Knoxville that my team has had conversation with who are involved in efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| that are on that track, and so I think as we think about this work, part of what we hope to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| identify those folks who are already doing that type of outreach and make sure that to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| that they desire to work with us, that we are able to help them build capacity so that what we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| happening in Knoxville is reflective of the best practices that have been shown to work nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| Does that make sense? Yeah, and I'd be happy to invite my colleagues LaKenya Middlebrook and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7897)|

| 2:11:48| partners locally if you'd like additional detail. I don't want to put any one person on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| without them knowing that we would mention them tonight, but we can provide a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| flavor for the types of work that we've seen locally happening already that we would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| learn more about and understand the ways that we can help build that capacity. Thank you. I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| going to close with, you know, my two requests are still that we put a lot more money into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| and I'm thinking at least 10 percent of what KPD is getting. If this is something that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| work, then that's what we need to put our money into, and there's a lot of evidence that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| that it works. And then two is to create something that's community-based, which includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7942)|
| 2:12:30| the city, includes the county, includes a lot of people, but the city doesn't have to do this by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| themselves. There are a lot of people who want to do this work. That's all. Thanks. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| Council Member Singh. Council Member Fugate. Let me go to Council Member Smith. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| Mayor. I think Council Member Smith has his hand up first. Okay. Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| you go first, and then we'll go back. How about that? All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| This is about as complex issue as it gets. And so while I appreciate the research that goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| applying other models that work elsewhere and kind of reviewing what adaptations need to happen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7984)|
| 2:13:12| those for it to work in Knoxville, none of these work in isolation. So it may be too early at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=7992)|
| 2:13:21| concept stage to discuss this, but I'd like to understand the interrelation between these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8001)|
| 2:13:28| approaches and the police departments and how they work independently or together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8008)|
| 2:13:36| If that's too complex at this moment, at some point, I'd like to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| Yeah. Thank you, Council Member Smith. And I will add to that that a third tier has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| with those root cause programs that are also really important. So it is maybe even more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8027)|
| 2:13:55| a three-legged stool, but it's a three-legged stool when you think about community-based violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| interruption, law enforcement, and then, again, these elements of root cause and addressing some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| of the cycles of poverty and other challenges that create the factors that lead folks into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8045)|
| 2:14:14| gun violence or being impacted by gun violence. So one of the things that I will say, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| is that we don't know yet exactly what they will look like, but the best practice and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8059)|
| 2:14:26| keys for success, I'll give you a few of those. So the first is that these efforts have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| very targeted and so very specifically focused on the place's database where crimes are occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8071)|
| 2:14:39| and where there are people who are engaged in violent crime, being victims of violent crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8079)|
| 2:14:44| and the specific habits that go about that, in particular, illegal guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| So that is data-driven and community-informed. So they have to be very targeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| and these efforts have to be coordinated. And so what we are looking to do through part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8092)|
| 2:14:59| is to establish those critical connections between the community-based interventions and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| policing strategies and specifically, and again, we don't know yet what these will look like, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| have to have clear points of accountability so that both parties, both the city, law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8107)|
| 2:15:14| city administration, community-based programs know what the expectations are and what the points of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8114)|
| 2:15:21| accountability are. So, for example, if the expectation is that we provide hospital-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| intervention after every single shooting, then when the cops call our partner and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| here's a victim, they're at Fort Sanders, that there is accountability that that partner shows up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| in the scene in the moment. So there are best practices that we can turn toward. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| guidelines both from policing networks as well as through networks such as Cities United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| that provide the framework for how those relationships ought to be structured. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8149)|
| 2:15:53| again, that's why we want to bring in that technical assistance so that they can understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| and help us digest what our landscape is and how we might forge that connection and what the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8157)|
| 2:16:03| agreement looks like. You know, how do we actually lay that out? So I don't know yet what it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| look like for our community, but they do have to be very systematic in how we go about that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| so that it's not so ad hoc. Chief Miller, I see you're on as well. Do you want to add to that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| all? No, I'm sorry for the delay. Yes, I think you hit it, Erin. I believe we're in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| and I can talk a little bit about the Crime Stoppers and other stuff you would like now, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| I know you all were just scratching the surface on the other layers of this proposal. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| want to get ahead of the discussion. Thank you, Chief. All right. Councilman Smith, did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| answer your question? Yeah. And I guess to maybe add on to that, I think it's like a lot of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8202)|
| 2:16:48| complex issues, cities have a lot of these things stem from deficiencies at the state and federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8208)|
| 2:16:55| level. We are having to correct a lot of things and support a lot of things. And these are complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| And I think it's not necessarily either or in which bucket it comes from. I think the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8222)|
| 2:17:10| should lead the way. And if these things can play a role and supplement or work in combination with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8230)|
| 2:17:17| our police department and other first responders and public safety efforts, they should work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8237)|
| 2:17:22| together. And so the pitting of one against the other, I don't think is necessary and likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| ineffective. So thank you, Councilmember Fugate. Over to you. And just to speak to that real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8249)|
| 2:17:36| I'm sorry. We will work with those groups. Obviously, that's not going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8256)|
| 2:17:44| I don't foresee any issues. But you know, we got to be careful. We got to keep a healthy distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8264)|
| 2:17:49| because these folks are embedded in the community. And they got to keep an air of objectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| viewed as objected by the community. So but we will work with them where we can and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| be supportive in this endeavor. Thank you, Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| Thank you, Mayor. First of all, I want to thank the Mayor and the administration for coming for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| a first request. A million dollars is a lot of money without a defined plan. We don't often do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8290)|
| 2:18:16| that. So I respect that we're asking, we're being asked to give startup money, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8296)|
| 2:18:24| to go ahead and start some work and begin doing some exploring and hiring folks. And I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8304)|
| 2:18:30| confident if you need to come back, you will before we do the budget. So I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| this 1 million is a one and done. I think it is a reasonable, fiscally responsible first request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8316)|
| 2:18:44| without a defined detailed plan. So I thank you for that. Second, Deputy Mayor Gill, my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8324)|
| 2:18:52| on the violence interruption piece. We talk a lot about gun in the hospital, we're talking a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8332)|
| 2:18:59| about gun violence, but there's tremendous domestic violence that also is a symptom of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8339)|
| 2:19:09| other things that can then lead to gun violence. I just ask that as you think about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| and hospital intervention, that some of that be considered as well, because often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8356)|
| 2:19:24| domestic, victims of domestic violence are very afraid. So that's all I would ask. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8364)|
| 2:19:33| Thank you. I think that's a great point. And I think, again, what we're trying to do here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| build that foundation. And so many of these strategies have overlap in the potential to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8376)|
| 2:19:43| serve numerous of these different types of crime that occur. So thank you, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| I think that's a great point. Okay, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8388)|
| 2:19:57| I do want to just say thanks to Councilmember Singh. I totally agree that this is not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| a city problem and we need to bring other partners to the table. Councilmember Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| you had a question and we'll go to Vice Mayor. Yeah, so we have someone from Cities United on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| the call. I'm just wondering if they could give us a little... Anthony Smith, he's the head of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| Cities United. Maybe give us some information about a program or something that's worked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8419)|
| 2:20:27| another city, even if it's not what we might do here, just to get a little better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8427)|
| 2:20:35| for anyone listening in what we're talking about. Mr. Smith, if you could start by stating your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| name and address for the record and just who you are since you're coming in, you know, zooming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| from Louisville, I think. Absolutely. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you for that question, Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| Anthony Smith, Executive Director for Cities United out of Louisville, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| You need my full address or just Louisville, Kentucky? No, Louisville, Kentucky is good. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| I appreciate that. And I think I will just highlight it and emphasize what Erin and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| Councilmember Singh said is this is a system that you all are building up and it does, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| we've seen programs work, but if they're not continually invested in and they're not connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| and coordinated, it doesn't last for a long while. So we always come in and ask folks to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| comprehensive strategy, looking at the programs that we've talked about and identifying the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| ones that work for your city. They have to be community-based. They've got to be in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| with community. And you've got to create a broad table of folks who are all working in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| on this issue. But we do know that if you implement the programs outlined, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| another one that we also talk about, it's advanced peace. It's called the Peacemaker Fellowship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| that was modeled out of a program in Richmond, California, that has also seen significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| drops in their homicides and shootings by not only identifying the folks who were most likely to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| involved in the cycle of violence, but actually putting them into a fellowship, a paid fellowship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8519)|
| 2:22:05| And you start seeing those young men and women actually going to work inside the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8525)|
| 2:22:09| and working in different agencies and then going on to school. They were able to see a 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| reduction in their homicide over, I think, five years. But we can get you all the data from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8533)|
| 2:22:19| But all of the programs that Erin listed have seen decreases. But the number one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8539)|
| 2:22:26| we want to emphasize is that they, again, they've got to be coordinated and connected to a bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| systems of violence prevention. And they've got to be invested in long term. And they've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| have the resources that they need. So again, I just want to emphasize that, that this has got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| to be community driven, community led, and community engaged. But the city has a role to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| play as a convener and as an organizer. And I think to somebody's point of making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8565)|
| 2:22:51| all of the departments see that they have a role in creating public safety, that is not just on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8571)|
| 2:22:57| law enforcement, and it's not just on this team, but all of our departments inside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8577)|
| 2:23:01| government playing the role and addressing the root causes that you all have talked about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| So making sure that we just have a comprehensive strategy that looks at all of the city resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| and bring them all to the table together. But I love that the way that the mayor framed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| we've got to do a two-pronged approach. We've got to address what's happening today while we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| build out this long term strategy at home. But I would just say, Council Member, to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| advanced piece and recognize that. But then the care violence and the street interruption model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| we know work. And then the last thing I'll say is that the hospital based intervention strategy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| actually a national group of folks who work in partnership and do TA for each other and partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8617)|
| 2:23:44| with each other. But all of the folks that they talked about that do the interruption are from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| the community, they're trusted in the community, and they're trained to do this work. So they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| a natural, already doing the work, as you heard some of the folks from the community talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| but just have never been resourced to really scale it up the way that you all need to scale it up. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8641)|
| 2:24:07| I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| Okay. I guess to follow up on what you just said, like we've done things that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8649)|
| 2:24:16| resourced but never been fully tapped in or scaled up. I may not have repeated that exactly as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8656)|
| 2:24:23| said it, but... No, I think that's it. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I just want to say that is the challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8663)|
| 2:24:29| is to stay the course and the follow through and do the build up. Yeah. And making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8669)|
| 2:24:37| whoever is your coordinator inside, that team of folks who's coordinated, have access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8677)|
| 2:24:43| department heads and the folks who actually can help move stuff is also very important too. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8683)|
| 2:24:49| think it's not just a political will that needs to be done. We also got to work with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| so that the community can continue to have the public will to push this work. Because once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| start seeing numbers drop, we get to a comfortable place. But this is not just about saving lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| This is actually, I think, to some of you all's point around righting some of the wrongs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| and addressing some of the inequities that have been happening, not only in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| but across the country for years that continue to create this environment for violence to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| So how do we think through all of that? And I appreciate Council Member Smith. It's complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| It's not easy. It's not going to be an overnight fix, but it's something that we got to work at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| day to day. But having those leaders inside a city government who pull people together is super| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| important to making sure, to your point, Council Member, that we stay the course and we stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| focused on it. Thank you for a little bit more information. More to come. Absolutely. We look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8736)|
| 2:25:44| forward to it. You guys are right up the road, so we'll see you soon. Thank you. Any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8744)|
| 2:25:50| from Council? Vice Mayor McKenzie. Thank you, Mayor. And I just want to say that I very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8750)|
| 2:25:58| appreciate the sense of urgency with this amendment and also the partnership with Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8758)|

| 2:26:12| violence. I want to be really clear that, you know, it does take a village. It does take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| village. And we as public servants are part of that village, as well as the community. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| want to acknowledge the people who are already doing some work in the community that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| doing the work in the community, that are roots on the ground, that have been working tirelessly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| try to help with the outreach, but just don't have the capacity building that they need. I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| us to forget about those organizations when it comes to trauma training and some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8799)|
| 2:26:46| that Cities United can provide that will actually equip them even better to do the work that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| doing in tandem with Cities United and their strategies. Again, this is going to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| holistic, you know, it's going to require a holistic approach because a lot of these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| family issues. They are families who are dealing with trauma. And that translates in so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8822)|
| 2:27:07| different ways. We also are dealing with a lot of disparities, socioeconomic disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| folks without jobs. I mean, when we look at the unemployment rates and the poverty rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| and again, it ties back into the African American Equity Restoration Resolution to also help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8838)|
| 2:27:25| some of these things. Right now, I think that we do have to be laser focused on the violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8845)|
| 2:27:30| but never lose sight of, again, the holistic approach that we all need to take. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| I do hope that we will continue to listen and get the feedback from some of these other groups that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| are having meetings as well in the wake of these tragedies that we've seen here recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| because that information is very important as well. And so, I would hope that, and that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8866)|

| 2:27:56| that information because, again, it will still require all of us working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| even though we have Cities United looking at those strategies. The information that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| gathering from people living in the community and getting their thoughts is very germane to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| the success of all the work that will be put into this crime and violence prevention, especially as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8890)|
| 2:28:17| it relates to a ramdang activity. So, just want to share that and just continue to stay focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8897)|
| 2:28:24| And Mayor, I appreciate you being open-minded as well as Council as it relates to if there is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| resources that are needed, that we are diligent in putting those back into the community to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8909)|
| 2:28:36| these efforts. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Middlebrook, did you have something to clarify or add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8916)|

| 2:28:53| wanted to highlight that really our focus over the course of these conversations has been to center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8933)|

| 2:29:16| enhance that capacity or begin building capacity. And so, that is really the goal of the work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8956)|
| 2:29:23| what we are really excited to work with Cities United on is providing resources and tools for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| those folks in our community who are on the ground either already doing the work or who have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8968)|

| 2:29:43| Just in terms of this initial funding, and I know you don't have a full sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8983)|
| 2:29:52| who would receive this initial funding, but with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| initial partnership that the city has with Cities United, are we to assume that the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=8997)|
| 2:30:06| funding would focus on groups working to intervene when it comes to violence impacting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9006)|

| 2:30:38| to do more specifically. But yes, this is going to build on the work of Save Our Sons, which focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| young Black men and boys of color, and unfortunately, you know, that is a focus of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| continued efforts, because all too often they are the victims and sometimes, you know, the suspects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| in some of these violent crimes. So that will be a focus, and, you know, Cities United will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9057)|

| 2:31:27| about those who are most impacted by gun violence. And again, I also want to clarify on the Cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210223-combined?start=9087)|
