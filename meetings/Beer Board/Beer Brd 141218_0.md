| 0:01:21| For two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| All right, well, let's move them to the heel of the agenda then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| Do I have a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=85)|

| 0:01:59| We need the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| This is in Councilman Greaves' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Would somebody like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| I move we accept it pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Okay, final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Tell us about LaRosa's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| That's a new business, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| They're based out of Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| It's their largest pizza and Italian place in Cincinnati.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| They're in Red Stadium, Bangle Stadium, Kings Island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| But it's kind of a family pizzeria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Our beer sales are like 1% to 3% of total sales, so it's not a huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| But every once in a while somebody wants a beer with a pizza, so it's something I had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Well, thank you and good luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| And when you get the rest of the things done, you'll be able to pick up your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Yeah, we're under construction right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| It's against the law, isn't it, to not have a beer with pizza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| I thought you had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=180)|

| 0:03:07| Moti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| I guess that's Moti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=189)|

| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, the health department approval, and the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=212)|

| 0:03:36| I move we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Wait, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| I see the note that says that it's okay given the proximity of a religious facility there if it's off-premise only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Is that what is being sought, I guess, is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| It's like a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| You just take your little six-pack and go kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=240)|

| 0:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| I looked at that myself, and I'm not sure that measurement might be as the bird flies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| but if you walk from the shelf to the church, I think it's more than 300 feet, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| I wonder how they measure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| It's probably a straight line, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=271)|

| 0:04:53| Behind Ichiban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=293)|

| 0:07:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=421)|

| 0:07:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| We have two items for consideration on the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=436)|

| 0:07:29| Ken McMullen, Post Office Box 650, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| And I know that you needed a little bit of an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| You had a surprise at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| A couple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| How long do you need this extended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Well, we're asking for 24 months because I don't want to keep coming back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| We have a tenant now that exercised their year lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| and then we have a little environmental problem where the dry cleaners was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| which is once they move out, then we'll start tearing down and get it cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| And so, you know, I'm asking for 24 months because I know it's going to be at least 15, 16 by the time I get them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=489)|

| 0:08:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=506)|

| 0:08:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141218?start=510)|
