| 0:00:28| Welcome to the Board of Education's May 2nd, 2022 work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=28)|
| 0:00:38| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=38)|
| 0:00:58| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=58)|
| 0:01:20| Our May 4th regular session meeting will be held in this boardroom and begin at the regular 5 p.m. start time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| Also, a policy review meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, May 11th at 1.30 p.m. and a joint education committee meeting is also scheduled for that day at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=88)|
| 0:01:38| A location for both meetings will be public noticed as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| Also, Ms. Satterfield is running a little late, but she will be joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| Do we have any requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| So a motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Henderson. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=116)|
| 0:02:06| And Ms. Horne, I think you have an announcement on our new student rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| Yes, thank you. Ms. Coatney has been so kind to give me some notes, so I'm just going to kind of read through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| This year's student representative selection committee process began back in February with the announcement and distribution of application packets to every high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=140)|
| 0:02:30| Rising seniors had until Monday, March 28th to submit applications to the board office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| We received 21 applications, and those students were from Austin East, Bearden, Central, Farragut, Fulton, Halls, Hardin Valley, Carnes, L&N, Powell, and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=156)|
| 0:02:50| So we were very happy that we had such a broad representation of schools. That was really a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| Once these were received, the applications were redacted and all personal information including the student's name, their school, gender, address, and reference names were redacted for the first phase of the scoring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=176)|
| 0:03:10| The selection committee consisted of secondary education executive director Danny Trent, principal Andrew Brown, current student representative Raymond Jenn, community members Melissa Mason and Chris Whitehead, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=190)|
| 0:03:26| We met on August 8th to review instructions on scoring the applications in the areas of leadership, communication, organizational skills, academic achievements, community service, extracurricular activities, and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=206)|
| 0:03:42| Each committee member submitted their individual scores for each application and a total score was then calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=222)|
| 0:03:51| Each year the committee commits to interviewing the top scoring three to five candidates, taking into consideration any natural break in the scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=231)|
| 0:04:01| This year the top four candidates were interviewed by the selection committee on April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| Once again, each committee member submitted interview scores which were then added to the student application scores for a grand total and the top scoring student was contacted and offered the position for 2022-2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=249)|
| 0:04:25| And I've been on this committee I think two years ago and as always the students are so impressive and it's always so great to be able to read through their applications and see why they want to be a part of this and then to interview them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=265)|
| 0:04:41| So this year is no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| We had some great students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| It's always extremely challenging to score those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| And so it's just a delight to see so many who are engaged and who want to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| So the candidate that we selected, her term will begin on July 1st and end on June 30th, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=295)|
| 0:05:06| And I'm happy to introduce Grace Deckard of Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| And we will be sharing more about Grace when she begins her term in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| And hopefully she can attend our June meeting to sit with Raymond and learn the ropes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| And I believe she's here, isn't she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Grace, would you come on up and just say hello to everybody so we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| Grace, thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=330)|
| 0:05:43| You're just going to love her and love having her on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| We just really enjoyed meeting her when we met a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| And so she will be a great addition to our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| And I think you're able to be here next month, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| So you'll be able to sit with Mr. Ginn and he can teach you everything he's learned this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| So we're thrilled to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Thanks so much for coming tonight, Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=368)|
| 0:06:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| And congratulations to Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| We look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| So next we have our Bright Start Greater Knoxville report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| And Mr. Watson, I believe this was something you wanted to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| So, yes, I'm thrilled to have Ellie Kittrell, who's overseeing the BrightNet Network for Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| through the United Way here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| Also, Jonathan Schoonover, who's the vice president of the Bright Start Network for Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| through the Tennessee Inequalities for Early Education, is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| So with my work over the last 15 years in the community with the Restoration House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| and working with lower-income mother-led families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I've seen firsthand the impacts of early education in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| And so I'm thrilled that we have TQEE and United Way and others coming around a collective impact strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| to elevate the value of early education in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| And this has a direct correlation to the work that we do in K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| We all know how much we talk about reading proficiency by third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| And we also know through the research how important it is to be able to engage those students even before they enter kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| So I think the work of Bright Start and the partners that are at the table there are going to even help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| are going to help align with what we do and elevate the work of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| So I'm thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| This network got started in January of last year, so today was a big day for this network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| and I'm thrilled that Ellie is here to help present to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| I'm speaking in front of the school board, and the honor is absolutely all mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| So let me make sure we've got this working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I'm Ellie Kitcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| I'm the Director of Early Care and Education with United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Am I pointing to here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Oh, I've got to turn it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| So the purpose of our check-in today, we really wanted to make sure and get in front of our stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| and update on our progress, our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| Hopefully by the end of my presentation, we will have highlighted the core reasons that Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| Knox County should care about what happens in early childhood for over 53,000 children ages 0 through 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| We will define how United Way of Greater Knoxville is utilizing the collective impact process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| as part of a statewide cohort to develop an early care and education strategic plan for Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| Also, we're going to ask that the Board of Education's input on key strategies happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| so that we make sure that everything that we are prioritizing in the plan that you all are well aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| and have had your opportunity to provide feedback, input, questions, concerns, and recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| for those who might need to be a part of this process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| So early childhood matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| This is my mantra, and as a system of early care and education that supports the system also matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| I have the privilege of helping navigate our community through its first ever early care and education strategic planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=576)|
| 0:09:45| I will start with the why, and we'll focus on three main topics, brain science, economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| and equity of access to quality early care and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| First, we're going to dig into the brain science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| Early experiences affect the development of brain architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| which provides the foundation for all future learning, behavior, and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| If you build a house, what is the first thing that you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| You build a foundation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| What are some symptoms that show us later on that that house was built on a weak foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| There's cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| There's system issues, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| And if a foundation is laid poorly in early childhood, we see symptoms such as addiction, disease, academic problems, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=624)|
| 0:10:33| that develop later on in life, not necessarily so close to early childhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| The architecture of a young child's brain is shaped by the interaction between genes and experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| and this can have either a positive or a negative result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| Negative experiences, like adverse childhood experiences, negatively impact the architecture of the developing brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| Children thrive in a safe, stable, nurturing environment of supportive families, environments, caregivers, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=659)|
| 0:11:10| communities, schools, and, of course, child care settings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| In the first few years of life, one million new neural connections form every second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| which means every second counts for brain development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| A child is born primed for learning, and that child's experiences create and influence neural connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| As demonstrated by this picture, by the time we are two, neural connections abound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| 85% of brain volume is developed by three years of age, 90% by age five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| The early years are the most active period for establishing these important neural connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| but new connections can form throughout our lifespan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Thank goodness we can still learn, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Hashtag lifelong learner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| While a child's brain continues developing, the important task of pruning occurs, and this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| I know we're getting into weeds here, but the developing brain places emphasis on those experiences that are repetitive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| We hear a lot about how critical serve and return, and we've got the nursery rhymes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| and we've got things that repeat, those books, reading that same book over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| There's genius behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| In an effort to speed up transmission of signals, the brain begins to prune out those connections that are used less frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| in order to expedite the connections that happen more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| This helps ensure that the neural connections that are most frequently used in the developing mind are retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| It's use it or lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| So this has a double-edged sword, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| On one hand, positive, healthy, growth-promoting experience help to develop brains that are efficient and sophisticated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=772)|
| 0:13:00| language, sight, movement, and gravity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| But for some young children, their developing brains are incorporating experiences that are abusive, or they're profoundly neglectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| and these alter the brain's processing, sometimes for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| I could give an entire presentation on adverse childhood experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| I know Daniel and several of you probably could as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I hope we have an opportunity to do that at some point, but it is really incredible, the impact it has on our brains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=804)|
| 0:13:32| The overarching message from science is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| How children develop early in life matters later for them and for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| Healthy child development is the foundation for educational achievement, economic productivity, responsible citizenship, and lifelong health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| These are the pillars for successful parenting of the next generation, which ultimately result in strong communities and a healthy economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=828)|
| 0:13:58| This is not just opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| It comes from neuroscience, molecular biology, genetics, behavioral and social science, and even from economic analysis of human capital development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=841)|
| 0:14:11| What all these sciences are trying to tell us is that healthy development in the early years means children will be more successful in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| and as adults, they will be more productive contributors to our economy, being more responsible participants in their communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| and therefore this leads to longer, healthier lives, productive lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Transitioning a bit into the economic impact of why we're addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| The earlier the investment, the greater the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| This makes sense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| The majority of brain development is happening before our kids go into kindergarten, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| So that return on investment is highest in those early years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| By providing young children with a healthy environment in which to learn and grow, it's not only good for their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| Economists have also shown that high-quality programs bring impressive returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Nobel laureate, prize-winning economist James Heckman has demonstrated that we see a 13% or a $6.30 return on investment for every dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=907)|
| 0:15:16| spent on high-quality early childhood education programs and environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| That goes up if that child is experiencing any type of trauma or is in an economically disadvantaged household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=921)|
| 0:15:29| It goes up to as high as $13 per dollar spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| But of course, we have a misalignment in our programs to change the brain and the spending on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| versus our brain's capacity to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| Continuing on in the economic impact of early care and education here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| for an infant, this is the average price of infant care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Now, I want to qualify that this is not necessarily high-quality care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| This is just care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| High-quality care for an infant in Knox County can run as high as $15,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| This is 17% of the median household income in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| And if that is a single parent living in poverty, that's over 50% of their income, just for one infant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| So the cost of child care is higher for families in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| It's higher than it ever has been before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| It's going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And as it's going up and in the wake of the pandemic, we have a really crisis-level event happening in staffing in our child care environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=998)|
| 0:16:50| Pay is abysmal for these workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| For years, it has been minimum wage, if a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| They're starting to move up into still sub-living wage category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| They are increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| But this is a real challenge, and we saw the impacts of this during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| Quality care is only harder to come by as we begin to recover from the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Parents are struggling to pay for and to find quality child care so that they can get back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| I'm sure many of you have experienced this firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| In 2019, there was an economic study done by Tennesseans for Quality Early Education that showed that just in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| so this is not Knox County-wide, there was over $122 million annual impact losses due to insufficient child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1054)|
| 0:17:44| Loss in productivity, loss in wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| That's a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| We also have some distinct disparities in Knox County that have a direct impact on whether or not a child has access to high-quality learning experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1073)|
| 0:18:02| before entering kindergarten, the root cause of which is almost always tied to household income pretty consistently across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| The lack of access to resources and information that support high-quality early learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| And just looking at poverty levels alone, we see some striking disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| and also the alarming fact that 40% of our kiddos, 0 through 5, in Knox County are economically disadvantaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1102)|
| 0:18:31| which means they're at 200% or below federal poverty guidelines for household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| Definitely not in that living wage category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Also, it's important to note the difference here between black and white median household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| We have one of the largest disparities in the state of Tennessee between those two numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1128)|
| 0:18:58| You all are very familiar with TCAP, but I wanted to just highlight that these disparities in income are also directly correlated to academic outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1138)|
| 0:19:10| and that's something that we are taking a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| I will say the target population for our strategic planning efforts is focused on the economically disadvantaged population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| and those that provide services and care for those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| So, what are we doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1167)|
| 0:19:37| We talked about why early childhood matters, and we talked about why United Way is focusing on this critical time in human development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| but let's dig into what we're doing to hopefully achieve system-level impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| We have joined Tennesseans for Quality Early Education as part of the Bright Start Tennessee Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| We are one of six cohort communities across the state, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| We're one of the six original communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| We have technical assistance and support, and this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| We can leverage statewide resources into our community, particularly where policy change is necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| and there's state and federal funding to support the strategies that we define here locally as our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| The vision and mission of Bright Start is a continuum of high-quality early care and education from birth through third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| and that that's the norm for all Tennessee children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| Bright Start Tennessee will tap into the power of communities across our state collaboratively to design, implement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| and scale high-quality early care and education systems locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| Once the State of Tennessee Department of Education defines its goal regarding reading and math proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| we will align to those reading and math goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| We know that third grade is a benchmark year for future academic success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| A student not reading at grade level in third grade is four times more likely to drop out of high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| but I also hope you are beginning to understand that proficiency in reading depends on the quality of their early learning experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| experiences that are happening before our kiddos enter the K-12 education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1277)|
| 0:21:26| The approach that we're using is called a collective impact approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| This centers on five major conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| One, that you have a backbone organization that's not a volunteer-based organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| That's where United Way and Bright Start Tennessee come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| We're kind of acting as that glue and that neutral convener and facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| The other conditions are developing a common agenda across that system, creating shared data measurements and outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| creating mutually reinforcing activities within that system, and creating an infrastructure for continuous communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1316)|
| 0:22:07| For those that are competitive at all with other counties across the state, we actually just added a red square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| so we're technically ahead of everybody, if anybody cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| But we are making great progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| I won't go through all of this, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| but this gives you an idea of the methodology and the process that we're using along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| This is the system that we are engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| It's vast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| You can kind of see our kiddos in the middle, and we've got a system in care and education, health, social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1361)|
| 0:22:50| parents, family, and community engagement, and other influencers, and their proximity to that child's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| We're trying to have versions of folks all across the system involved in this planning process in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1377)|
| 0:23:12| This is the list of our advisory committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| This is kind of like our leadership committee, our governing council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| We've got three individuals there highlighted that are directly tied with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| We've got Renee Kelly, Dr. Beth Lackey, and Daniel Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| We're very thankful for their commitment and input into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| In the first 90 days, this kind of gives you an idea of the first round of stakeholder interviews that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| to sort of begin our community assessment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| These are the organizations that have been involved in our working groups, which was the next phase of our planning work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| Ultimately, what we were able to land on after that assessment, after establishing our advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| gathering our first levels of data, community surveys, and bringing our working groups together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| we've landed on three major goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| Health, mental health, and development on track beginning at birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Supported and supportive families and communities, and high-quality birth-to-age-eight learning environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| For each goal, we are focused on five different measures of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| These will be kind of the themes, if you will, that we want to make sure that we are including in the strategic planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| and in our shared measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| It's not the comprehensive list of things that we will be measuring and looking at, but it's kind of like the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| We feel like these measures of success are what's going to be critical in order to get us to achieve reading and math proficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| and supporting those kids towards that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| Here is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| So timeline of our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Again, we began the community assessment last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| In September, we started the process of adopting our three goals, our measures of success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| and defining our statement of need that's local here to Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| Our working groups began in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| They started with root factor analysis, or those in supply chain root cause analysis, statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| Does that bring you back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| But really trying to understand, hey, if we want to achieve this goal, if we want to look at this measure of success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| what is uniquely happening in Knoxville, Knox County that's going to prevent us from getting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| What's that barrier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| What's that thing that we need to tackle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Or even better, what's that awesome thing happening in Knoxville, Knox County that's allowing us to achieve these measures of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| or this goal already and really highlighting those critical assets that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Because we do have some really incredible things happening in Knoxville, Knox County already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| I feel like we've got a lot of ingredients in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| This is hopefully a better recipe for us to pull all those ingredients together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| So right now, this is where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| We're engaging with different stakeholder groups to try and get feedback on the key strategies that were identified by those working groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| So for each goal, we had a working group, and they did a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| They did the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| They had a lot of gathering time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| They had a lot of tough discussion time, and they came up with some strategy recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| In March, we had a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| Everybody made incredible presentations to the wider group, and we evaluated those strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| So we've gone already through a first round of evaluation on fit, partnership, capacity, and resources, and overall impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1608)|
| 0:27:00| So now we're taking those kind of down-selected, that first-round priority strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| and we're trying to get stakeholder feedback and make sure we're sound before we get into the nitty-gritty of action planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1627)|
| 0:27:17| The timeline of our launch, we hope, is that in August, we will have an official adoption of final plan elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1637)|
| 0:27:29| and in September, we will move forward with a public launch of the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| In the fall, we will also subsequently launch a coalition of sorts that will be the ongoing governance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1654)|
| 0:27:44| and accountability mechanism for the plan, making sure that, first of all, the plan is continually relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| Things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Pandemics happen, and we need to be flexible in our planning process ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| and so that coalition will be there to sort of keep us grounded and anchored to what's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| but also allow us to change as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| We are targeting a three-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| We hope that this is just the first, that we are building momentum towards longer-term planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| but things are happening so quickly, we felt like it would be near impossible to plan beyond that third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1700)|
| 0:28:30| So here's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| You have these very large packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| There's more detail in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| I would love for you all to take time to read through those strategies, read through the goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| the measurements of success, our statement of needs, some of the data, and read through those strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| and give us feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| I will email you a form, a SurveyMonkey form, in order to make it hopefully easy for you to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| and give us your feedback and notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| We take what you have to say very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and I can't tell you how critical it is that your voices are represented in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| I also encourage you to ask questions, either here tonight, I know it's a busy schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| or you can contact me directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| I'd love to meet with you one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I'd love to refine our process even further by your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Every time I have an interaction, I learn something else, we think about something new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| that we can bring into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| I also would love to hear from you organizations or people that need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| Hopefully, as I'm talking, some names came to your brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| You're like, oh, this person would be really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| They love this, or they're so knowledgeable, and their voices need to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| We want to bring them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Also included in your packets, I won't go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| but there's just some other versions of work like this that are happening across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| I cited a couple of Memphis here in Tennessee, Memphis and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| They've been in this work for the better part of a decade or longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| and so we get to learn what's worked and not worked from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| and move a bit faster, which is the good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| The bad news is we've got some catching up to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| There's also some really great statewide coalition examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| I encourage you to look at Florida, Alabama, Nebraska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| They've got some incredible work in the early learning, early care and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| that we can definitely look toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Thank you, Ms. Kittrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Actually, I think Ms. Satterfield has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Thank you, Ellie, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you for the work that you're doing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| I think you are the right person to lead this work and this coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| so I'm excited to see the outcome that's coming from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I do have a question, just a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Nothing too hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| But the six original cohort communities, I was curious, did we get selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| Was it volunteer support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Was it an application process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| How was Knox County determined to be one of the six original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| So there was somewhat of an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| It was not a formal application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| There were elements that needed to be in play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Certainly an appetite or some pre-work done towards wanting to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1903)|
| 0:31:52| in an early care and education planning situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| In my work at Muse Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| that was obviously something I'm very passionate about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| and I had already started to do some research around starting an early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| childhood coalition kind of as a spinoff of the Muse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| But ultimately the needs and the research kept growing and growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| and United Way was also coming along at that time and seeing that the crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| that our early care and education system is going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| and wanting to address it from a system standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| So timing, timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Tennesseans for Quality Early Education also was making headway towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| recognizing the need for a statewide cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| So everybody that's involved in the cohorts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| they had to provide matching funding to the funding provided for TQEE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| So it was another reason why United Way was a better choice to carry forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| this work here in our local community, both from a funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and a neutral convener standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| And I just wanted to lift that up because, like what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| the ingredients are already here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| How do we make sure we put them all together to create what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| for our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you, Ebony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Ms. Bam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I also want to thank you for the work you're doing and for Mr. Watson getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| to come talk to us about this because I think we all realize, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| we get kids at five, some kids at pre-K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| but it is those early years that matter so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| So I am wondering as I'm thinking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| is the Bright Starts everybody talking to the state and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| Because, I mean, I think a lot of us do see the need for better funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| on the pre-K level, which would come from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| So are those conversations going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Are we more concentrating on what can we do locally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| Yes and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| They're happening at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| So I think there's some recognition that we need to strengthen our policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| advocacy, and awareness work at the local level so that we'll strengthen our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| work at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And so I know TQE is singularly focused on bringing forth this mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2043)|
| 0:34:12| and vision at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| But certainly us coming behind and strengthening that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| or anchoring it across the state adds weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| One thing, I can't believe I didn't say this at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| because it's so incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| You know how everybody has like a why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Why do you get involved in anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| I mean, each one of you are servant leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| and there's a why while you're sitting there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| And my why for here is I was putting together an education day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| an education session for leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| I was on the curriculum committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Education is clearly my passion point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| so I got to help pull all the people together for planning that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| And there were several Knox County folks involved in that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| And one of my favorite questions I always start with is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| if you could wave a magic wand and fix anything, what would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| So that question was posed, and it was about K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| It had nothing to do with early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| We were talking about K-12 education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Almost every single voice in that meeting said they would work on early care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| so we had better visibility, better understanding, better intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| better assessment on those kiddos before they came into kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| so we could be ready and waiting to meet them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| with the fullest of our capacity and knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| the minute they stepped in that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Not having that understanding at the beginning of that childhood experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| sets us back two to three years at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| And I have chills talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| I mean, that was a big light bulb moment for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| I'm like, okay, we've got to go further upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| And so that was really what started me researching the Early Childhood Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| and more of the policy side of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| I mean, I love the Muse, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| It's the heart of my mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| I will talk about the importance of play and learning all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| But this is a bigger need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| On the advocacy front, I'm so thrilled that Bright Start is a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Tennesseans for Quality Early Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| and we know that they're doing a lot of advocacy work at a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| I think it would be great if TQEE and Bright Start locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| would continue to, through email and other ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| kind of elevate things that the board members can be advocating for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| at a state level around early education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| for those who are passionate about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| and just kind of get us involved in that advocacy work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I think could be really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| And then you mentioned it just a second ago about moving upstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| I know so much of the work that I've been involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| for the last 15 years in the community is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| directly tied to the lack of high quality early education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| So thrilled that Bright Start is happening in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| and that we're now a part of that statewide energy and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| So thank you for helping lead it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| and thanks for helping tonight and being here to present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| I really didn't have anything else to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| other than I appreciate this work also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| And I think that's one of the biggest things that I've learned as a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| in just talking with teachers and what I've learned over these years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| is just how important this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| And it feels so difficult for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| because we have so few pre-K opportunities for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| So I'm anxious to see what this leads to in the partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| And so thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I appreciate that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| So any more questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| So thank you again for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| I'd like to begin by highlighting an important event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| that took place earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| The One Book Read City initiative was launched this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| As part of this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| every elementary student in our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| will receive a free book entitled The Chocolate Touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| They will also have an opportunity to participate in fun activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| designed to promote literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| I'm especially thankful to Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| and 6th District Board of Education member Betsy Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| thank you, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| for their leadership on this very important initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I would also like to congratulate Melody DeLily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| who is a student at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Last month, Melody was chosen as the city of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| first-ever youth poet laureate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| This is a tremendous honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| and I know that Melody will be a great ambassador for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| This week is Teacher Appreciation Week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| and Friday, May 6th is School Lunch Hero Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| I often say we have the best teachers in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| and I appreciate their dedication and hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| in helping our students learn and grow each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Our school nutrition workers also do an outstanding job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| and play an essential role in supporting the work of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| If you get a chance, please take a moment this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| to thank a teacher and a school nutrition worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| for all they do for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And finally, I want to remind everyone that Tuesday, May 3rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| that's tomorrow, is an in-service day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| and students will not be in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| We look forward to welcoming our students back to class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| on Wednesday, May 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Madam Chair, that concludes my report. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| And we next have our ESSER Priority Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I think Dr. Murphy is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2385)|
| 0:39:57| All right. Good afternoon, Madam Chair, Madam Vice Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Board, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you guys for this opportunity to share our ESSER report today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I'm Dexter Murphy, Director of ESSER Programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Today we're going to be sharing about ESSER 3, Priority 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| First, I wanted to highlight this and just recognize for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| that we've been recognized as the best district for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| You guys know that, obviously, but I just wanted to put this in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| This is great news because it shows that the state recognizes us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| for directly allocating our dollars directly towards student achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| and improvement, so pat on our back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| So we're doing a great job there, so I just wanted to highlight that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Also, just moving into letting you guys know that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| we're going to be talking about Priority 2, which is Effective Educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| And Mr. Scott Bolton, our Executive Director of Human Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| will be up here to share out some brief updates with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| I also love this slide because it just pulls us back to our why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| The next two years we're talking about accelerating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| What are we going to do right now to make sure that we create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| sustaining strategies within these ESSER dollars to make sure we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| sustaining the work with our staff and students for the next three to five years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| This is our reporting schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Just letting you guys know this is round four, so we're getting tighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| This one should be a lot more brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| We're getting better along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| This one is regarding Priority 2, Effective Educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| We start back over in June with Trimester 2 with that reporting as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| so we've made some progress with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| I created this slide just to show you guys some key outcomes from this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| that we're getting ready to hear about from Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| The key outcomes from Effective Educators, first of all, the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| The increased teacher attrition rate has led to more new teachers in KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Many of these new teachers have experienced fewer in-person student teaching experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| than normal years as a result of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Additionally, we have experienced an increase in the percentage of administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| in their first year in head principal roles in comparison to the previous years prior to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| So this priority specifically addresses the need to create a more specific approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| to building teacher and school leader capacity to make instructional decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Also, this priority also focuses on addressing staffing difficulties resulting from the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| by creating a plan for recruitment and retention of high-quality educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| This is a very important strategy that you guys are going to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| And these are the outcomes that we hope to gain from this specific strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| that you'll hear about from Mr. Scott as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| So you've seen this slide four times now with this specific board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| so we still use the same criteria with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| I'm now going to turn it over to Mr. Bolton and his team to share with the updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Madam Chair, board members, if you'll take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| just to break down the Effective Educators, really broke it down into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| You'll see that there we're really focusing on the administrator teacher leadership supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| and then we're talking about the recruitment and retention of high-quality teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I think it's that two-prong component that is critically essential to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| You'll notice when we're talking about our owner there for the instructional practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| we have co-opted that out to our resident C&I person, Ms. Shannon Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| I appreciate her work in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| One of the things you will see in that when you look down into the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| there's a lot of overlap in a lot of the work that she's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| and so we're pulling that into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I've got with me Mitch Cox, who is the owner of the next two strategies, 5B and 5C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| That is the new teacher admin support and teacher leader support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Mitch, if you don't care, maybe wave so folks can see who you are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| And then when we're looking over there at the recruitment and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| I'm the owner of the incentives for the hard-to-staff areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| and then I've got Nate Langlois and Robert Angel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| and Nate is back there in the back when we're talking about our Grow Your Own programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| And then Ashley Huffaker is the brains behind our permanent subs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| and then our extended contract for special schools, and Ashley is back there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| So that is my group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Each of those are assigned action steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| and we'll kind of walk through real quickly our implementation updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| When we're looking at our instructional practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| we're excited that we're going to really look at piloting in particularly two schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| to really maximize the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Again, when we're talking about the instructional priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| we want to make sure that we're supportive of effective instructional practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| And I go back to my days of being a baseball coach back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| Back when I was a baseball player, my coach used to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| practice doesn't make perfect, but perfect practice makes perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| So this is our attempt to really make perfect practice make perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| not just practice make perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| But it's really tailoring those professional learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| and teaching coaching in these two practice schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| We're talking about an enhanced support at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| In strategy 5B, we're talking about specifically those that are new to the profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| either that being a teacher or those that are new to the administrative roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| And as a result, we are engaging with NIET.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| I know they have done a lot of great work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| but we're partnering specifically with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| and coupling a lot of their practices with cognitive coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| And Mitch is actually in the process of going through to be a train-the-trainer model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| so that we can implement that cognitive coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| What I really like about that is it works exceptionally well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| with our TIGER evaluation training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| It really allows us to enhance the things that are going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| in our TIGER evaluation program with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| So we're planning to launch in the fall of 2022 the year-long new administrators program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| to really bolster the sport around those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| I think as mentioned, as Dr. Murphy mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| we have a high concentration of new administrators in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and we really want to work around that support there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| And then finally, when we're talking about teacher-leader supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| our intentions are, with this cognitive coaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| is a training for over 200 administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| We're going to focus on teachers-leaders so that as the district expands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| that all of our administrators, be that principals, assistant principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| assistant administrators, those folks will all be trained in cognitive coaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| along with those people who are department chairs and teachers in the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| And again, that is just the intention of that is to really build capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| inside of KCS to really serve our evaluation model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| to get to the point where we're being perfect practice makes perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| So as you'll see, we're in good shape in terms of the level of our progress in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| Most of them are three out of four or four out of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| So let's kind of switch gears and move into our effective educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| when we're talking about the retention of our high-quality educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I want to say on the onset of this, when we're looking at creating those incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| for hard-to-staff schools, I want to recognize the fact that we believe wholeheartedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| that the best way to improve the education that we're providing for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| is to have the best educator in front of our students. That's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| I think if you look at research, that is imperative is to have the best educator there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| We also realize that having shared experiences when we're talking about educators of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| and trying to, as best we can, match the demographics of our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| adds a layer to that effective instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| And saying that, KEF brought the TECA, and you all have seen the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| but KEF brought the TECA as an opportunity and agreed to partner with us to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| We're going to use those findings to create an action plan kind of designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| to attract and retain our educators of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| And keep in mind in that report, those are the perceptions of our educators of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| that are currently in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| And so that, of course, is when we're looking at creating incentives for hard-to-staff schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| specifically looking at those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| And the second strategy, 6B, we're talking about our Grow Your Own program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Now, our Grow Your Own program, I don't know if you recall, but back in March of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| we were excited to roll out our Grow Your Own in three phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| And then all of a sudden COVID happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| So we're using a lot of these things to establish and to enhance that particular program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| that was already in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| In so much that we've created this program, and this is phase three of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| We're excited to announce that that is going to be starting in our schools this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| But it is a youth educator program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| It's a pipeline from the classroom to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| And those were set to begin offering classes in high schools through UTK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| with hopes of students getting up to 12 college credits in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| Again, compressing the time it takes them for being our student to our teacher back in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| The next thing we're talking about with permanent substitutes, as part of ESSER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| we're going to fund a permanent substitute in every school in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| We realize as we look through COVID particularly, it really stressed our ability to fill classroom vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2960)|
| 0:49:31| We realize that having one person in the school can make a significant impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Because we recognize and we appreciate the fact that we have a lot of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| who are having to spend maybe their planning time, at least one or two days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| in classrooms where there's not an opportunity for a sub to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| I will also say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| One of the biggest issues that we have with filling our sub positions are those last minute adds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| And if anything, the period of COVID and the pandemic has actually aggravated those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| We're seeing that happen more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Which the permanent subs seem to be, we hope, will be a remedy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| This is a one-year position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I know that we've heard feedback from people when we look at the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| that these may pay more than teacher assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| We are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| And we're not diminishing in no form or fashion the work that goes on in our TA classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| I will elevate that this position is a one-year funded position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| It's not something that we're looking at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| we're going to look and see how effective it is before we're looking at how we'll continue this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| So that is one issue when we're looking in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| The differential in pay is not significant, not that significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| It seems to be a smaller amount in the differential in pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| Permanent subs are going to be on a shorter contract than our teaching assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| So it offsets the total salary if we're looking at total salary there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| And then finally, when we're looking at our extended contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| we are adding a 216-day contract for all schools that are designated for schools of improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3066)|
| 0:51:14| by the State Department of Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We added two schools to this particular 216-day contract this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| and we are on track for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| So when you look through these, Priority 2, when you're looking at the strategies in Strategy 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| for the most part, through the four, we are in good shape with those and we're progressing on the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| So as far as our report card, the action steps that we have going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| we have about a third of those that we have not yet started, about 25% that we've completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| and 42% action steps that are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| We feel really good about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| What's really nice about those that have not started, those are quick actions that we turn on pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| So we're feeling good about our implementation with our ESSER Priority 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| This is another kind of quick glimpse at where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| All seven strategies are on track, a Level 3 or Level 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| We've got about 37% of our action steps that are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| 63% are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| We have zero, and I emphasize zero action steps with any delay or any minor delay whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| And action steps not started based on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| We're about a third of those, but that's expected again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| One of the largest barriers that we have to this, as you can well imagine, staffing challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| finding people to fill positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| And I think that's something that we're looking at market strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| we're looking at things like that to really try our best to fill these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| So with that being said, does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3178)|
| 0:53:06| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| This doesn't have as much to do with this, but I know some of our barriers that we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| was teachers coming from out of state, that it was just difficult just to come in and get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| Have some of those barriers gone away, or are we still having problems with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| Can a teacher from Georgia just come in right away and work in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| That is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Actually, a few, let's see, back during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| we had made recommendations through our state board of ed reps that we need to remedy that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| They heeded our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| It passed pretty quickly, the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| The second reading, it was put on a back burner and kind of sat there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| And then when all the COVID relief was implemented, the second reading took place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| So to answer your question, that was an issue historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| but those issues have been remedied through the state board of ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| and it's indicative of the fact that we have hired a lot of teachers from out of state this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| I mean, places as far as Washington State, California, Alaska,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| and just all over the continental United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Mr. Chin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Just really quick, it's really great to see the, what is it called, the youth educator program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| offering high school students the opportunity to learn a bit more about things within, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| about teaching and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| But could you describe a little bit more about, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| what are some of the skills or things that these students would be able to learn through this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| Well, that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| When you're looking at the teaching profession, you're looking at certain competencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| You're looking at the ability for a person to be able to relate to another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| You're looking at the ability to take a complex problem and break it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| and simplify it to the point where you are explaining those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| What's nice about this program is this program will not only be classroom time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| actually at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| but it will also be practical time where these students will have an opportunity to sit in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| of kindergarten class to really experience what it's like to be a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| And so that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| I'm glad you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| But those are the things that we're looking at, the ability to relate to another person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| the competencies that you have in terms of explaining the breaking down of a complex idea into simple steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| and relatability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| Scott, can you say a word about cognitive coaching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| I'm not very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| It sounds a little new age, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And then also, at scale, what does the Grow Your Own programs for us need to really be churning out in terms of teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| If it's really going to have the impact that we need it to have, where are we trying to get to with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| in terms of how many teachers are coming online through that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Let me take the latter first, and then I want to defer to the expert in the back with Mitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| I'll ask him to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So to answer your question, the State Board of Ed released in 2020, I mentioned this in my last presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| that we produced about 700 less educators than we produced in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| That's statewide, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| That's statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| That's statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| We're seeing significant growth across the state, which is an increased demand for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| So it's all hands on deck in terms of developing teachers that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| As you know, our Grow Your Own program is a three-phase program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Phase one of that program was taking our current interns that were with UTK, current interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3408)|
| 0:56:57| As you may know, UT is a five-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| The fifth year is a year-long internship, which basically, essentially, is an unpaid year of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3421)|
| 0:57:09| So with that phase one program, we repurposed teaching assistant positions that we couldn't fill otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| and repurposed those into aspiring teacher positions where these interns can actually have a livable wage with benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| and be able to go into the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| I think in year one, we actually had 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| In year one and year two, we had eight in that particular cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| If I'm not mistaken, I think all of those are now special ed or regular ed teachers for us in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| That is phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Phase two, we've got roughly about 25 current TAs that are going through programs to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| This year, we're hiring some of those as they have completed their program and will be ready to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| We've got an agenda item today that is an expansion of Grow Your Own phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| The initial cohort of that will be 12 folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| It's a slow walk into the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| It gives them a year to kind of onboard a lot of the competencies that they would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| before they step into the classroom as a teacher of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Phase three, we're looking at specifically three schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and those three schools where the youth educator program are, those happen to be flagship schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Those students that graduate there will be able to go to the University of Tennessee Knoxville free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| We're looking at how we can compress that time it takes from them being students in the classroom to teachers in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| That was a long way around to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| We realize the way you consume an elephant is one bite at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| We were talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| It's going to be a little here, a little there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I think I'm asking how much of an elephant do we need to eat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| What's the goals for the department in terms of the Grow Your Own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| We hear the numbers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| We've got 25 TAs, 12 in it now, phase one, which is great and it's excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| We're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| I'm just trying to get a sense of what's the critical inflection point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| I would measure our rate of success in the placement of positions in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| When we get to the point where we have no vacancies when school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| I'm thinking probably if we elevate to about 100 that are coming through that pipeline on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| Like on an annual basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| We should be able to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| That would be cumulative in all of those three phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| If we have a goal of reaching 100 in all those three phases annually, I feel comfortable that we'll be able to fill our demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3579)|
| 0:59:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| I'm going to turn it over to Mitch because he can tell you about cognitive coaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Cognitive coaching is basically a piece of thinking collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| We do adaptive schools, that's the other piece, and we do that training within Knox County as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| Cognitive coaching, we used to have some folks that were trained in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Those people have since then retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Cognitive coaching is basically a way for coaches to mediate the thinking of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3617)|
| 1:00:24| Instead of just giving them their solution or giving them the answers to their problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| it allows us to ask questions to where we're building the capacity in teachers to reflect on their practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| plan for their lessons, or problem solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| It's a way for us just to work with them and providing them the opportunities to really build their capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| and build their confidence in what they're already doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| as opposed to them just coming to us saying, hey, this is what you need to do and there's your solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| It's a national-wide training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I said we've had it in Knox County for a while, but we just lost our trainers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Thanks, Mitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| Do we have any other discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Thank you guys so much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| I think we're right at 20 minutes, so give us a big round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| We did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| No, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| Just a quick data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| This is round four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Just to give you some numbers, we have 347 action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Out of those 347, we have 73 that are on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| That's great news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| We're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| We may come back once more work has started and some things may dip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| That's part of the work, so we'll let you know that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Thank you, guys, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Thank you, Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Board members, there are some feedback forms with your packets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| if you want to leave those here, I guess, at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| Is that right, Ms. Covey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| So, board members, you received an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| but I wanted to note publicly that Superintendent Thomas and I agreed to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| items 7C, 19, and 20 regarding a KUB utility easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| and an agreement with Crazy Imagination Travel for Holston Middle School Show Choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| We can have discussions on these items as we go through the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3737)|
| 1:02:31| So, moving into that, 7A or B, any discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3751)|
| 1:02:42| Item C, 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Just a quick question about the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| and I'm thrilled that we're kind of to this stage with the Forward NGL work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| I noticed that there's a community coordinator identified within the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| and I know that Knox Ed Foundation has been taking care of the cost of this work with Forward NGL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| Is there any cost that the system, KCS, is going to bear as a result directly to this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| Is that a position that's being hired through Knox Ed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| I just wanted to be clear on that, the community coordinator position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Dr. Rice, what do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| So this Phase 4 is really just a continuation of the implementation for the project once we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3809)|
| 1:03:38| And so the Knox Ed Foundation will be paying for that in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| The position in and of itself I think is still kind of undefined is what that looks like as far as to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| The Knox Ed Foundation has been providing someone to serve in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| But as we look at our structure, even within our CTE department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| it may be something that we can do with existing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| But who owns that ultimately I think is still part of what we're developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| But we anticipate we may end up taking that role on formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| It's possible, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Like you'll see different communities, like Nashville has an organization called the Pencil Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| and it takes on that position there where it's kind of the corporate connector back to the academy coaches at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| So it's kind of the position that a new welding company comes to town, they go to lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| they kind of agree that these are kind of things you want to do in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| and then they connect them to the two or three schools that may have a welding program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| So there is kind of an intermediary between the business community and the schools that kind of exist in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| And, again, up until now, Knox Ed Foundation has kind of been serving in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| So where that lands fully, it may be something we reassign in our CTE department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| or it could be something that stays in a partnership with KEF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Okay. And then one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| As I've had different conversation with others in the district, specifically principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| one of the things that continues to come up is around school autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| So now that we're kind of in this phase of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| can you speak to the ability for our high schools that are involved in the forward and jail work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| to retain some level of autonomy in terms of how they operate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| That's a good question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| So, you know, it's kind of what's tight and what's loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| So if we look at this first batch of seven schools that have joined or have agreed to want to be part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| where we've been tight on things like for the coming year have been a freshman academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| teachers moving into that vicinity, working together in teacher teams as opposed to being in departmental teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| things like the freshman seminar that we offered for all freshmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| And off the top of my head, I think those are kind of the main pieces to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| a counselor and an assistant principal kind of dedicated to that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| So outside of that, we've kind of allowed schools to be able to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| here's kind of we will do those things, here's how we're going to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| So I think it's pretty clear on the freshman academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| they understand that the 10-12 moving forward will build out those similar things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| and they'll be on that journey with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| So, you know, we've had, again, people bring different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| An example would be freshman seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Some schools are doing that with two or three teachers for their whole group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I think we have one school that's using up to 12 of their teachers to teach that course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| and we're trying to work with both of those models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Some of it's going to be, you know, what works long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| We've had principals talk about scheduling, you know, AB schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| They use that in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Hardin Valley is on an AB schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| The rest of the district is on, you know, four by four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| As they talk through that, I think the plans are to leave it that way for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| But, you know, as we learn through the time it goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| it may be one of those places where principals decide, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| it makes sense for us to bring a proposed schedule change to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| So I think those are some examples of where we're trying to give them kind of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| non-negotiables for the next year and then how they work that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| and then, you know, we see what the best model is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| I appreciate in the contract the level of accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| and the data that's being asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| I think that makes all of us better when we're able to hold those benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| And so, I mean, there's like two and a half page of expectations in terms of metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| to move forward and measure this and make sure that we're doing what we need to be doing by our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| So I appreciate that element of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Ms. Horton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Dr. Isaac, does this portion include additional professional development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4045)|
| 1:07:34| Thank you, Ms. Horton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| So I would, to tell you the truth, have to look a little closer at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| So there is professional development included in exactly where it all fell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| If it was in this or was through our Perkins dollars that we're doing through CTE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| I think the majority of our training is through our Perkins dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| There's an organization called Alignment National that does a lot of that around freshman academy, freshman seminar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| I know we have those scheduled this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| I believe we're paying for those out of our Perkins dollars, our federal dollars, as opposed to Knox Head Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| I think this contract mainly is to continue with Jane and Donna, the two coaches you've met that have come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| Their continued support, us being involved in the network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| continue to be able to send teams and the other high schools to be able to explore that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and then just to implement and to put the master plan into effect that we got word was accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| So I think those are the main pieces of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| So is there any more discussion on those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Moving on, 7C, items 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| On item C2, could we have the actual intent attached so that we could read that before next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4126)|
| 1:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| Let me check on that because I thought we had, but I realized a few minutes ago that we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| So let me follow up on that and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| So item 7C, 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| 5 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| 7 or 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| 9 or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| 11 or 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| 13 or 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| 15 or 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| 17 or 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Mr. Oaks, this might be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| I was looking at number 18, and it just caught my eye, this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| And I started, I mean, it looks like quite a slide, and I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| I mean, and I was reading about it, and the whole point is to go from the upper level to the bottom level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| but then I was like, how are they getting back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| I mean, I'm assuming, since it seemed like there was a heart, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| Do you know what I'm even talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| I know about the slide, and it is a significant slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| and I don't think there is a mechanical way for them to get back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| I think you have to walk back up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| I mean, that was my only concern was it seemed like it was kind of connecting two play areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| but then they were getting the kids down, and I wasn't really sure how they were getting back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| And my understanding is their interest in this is they have a significant grade change on the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| and there was a lot of space there they were trying to figure out how best to take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| It was just an interesting proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| So item 19 or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| Moving on to board policies, section 8A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| I know last meeting in April we asked Mr. Dupler to go back and shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| and adjust some of the wording for policy B110 based on our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| and the friendly amendment that I brought forth to kind of rethink some of the way that we do around officer selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| So, Mr. Dupler, can you speak to that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| So on the agenda right now there's two different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| One is to keep the, of course, the original amendment was to blend two policies together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4323)|
| 1:12:12| so I'm not really speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| But option one would be to keep the current method of voting for board officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| and that would be to have a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| But then the second option was the one that I created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| and what I did was I went back to the policy that existed in 2016 and prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| and it talked about having the board organize at the voting meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4356)|
| 1:12:45| So that's what I've put into this proposal is to have the board organize at the first voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4365)|
| 1:12:53| but then to encourage, and this would be certainly a new aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| to encourage discussion of potential nominees at that work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| which would occur immediately before the voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| And then, but I wanted to keep the aspect where there wouldn't be a chair shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| because there were complaints from prior board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| and the reason that this policy, 16 policy, was one of the reasons it was originally changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| was that at that voting meeting there would be board members that would actually get up and move around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| and that was something that was viewed as negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| So in this option that I've provided for the board today or Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| it would have the actual, after the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| that the chair and the vice chair would not take their seat until the next immediate meeting after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| I appreciate your work on it, and I think you honored the intent that I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| in bringing that suggested change for us to talk about that earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| and I think, from what I understand, I think it honors the conversation that we had back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| So thank you for the work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| So I know, so correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| If we went with the one where we would elect the officers at the regular session meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4459)|
| 1:14:28| so that would be just as one of the regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| So I guess my question, and what I guess I'd like to hear from other board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| if we discuss this on, and this includes discussion of potential nominees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| is encouraged at the September work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| Well, one thing, I know Mr. Watson had the concern that when you come in for the regular session meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| and it's like the first thing you do, it's difficult because you don't really know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| So, you know, by the time you, as a new board member, would go through a work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| and then the bulk of a regular session meeting, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| So I think that that's a positive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| I would like to just, I would just like to hear other people's opinions on the discussion at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| I guess I'm just wondering if that's going to make an already awkward situation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| awkward for, you know, a whole week instead of one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| That's kind of my question, is if you, you know, if you share your intent or, you know, at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| That's just kind of what I'd like to hear from other people about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| Ms. Spaff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| And I don't feel strongly about this, but I think you're right about discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| And I'm not going to be on the board, so I don't feel like my views I want to push strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| but just my thoughts on it is I do sort of see where he's coming from of the way we do it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| it's like when you're trying to vote is when you're hearing the names for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| And I think it can, you know, even with us when we all knew each other, it can kind of be a little jolting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| And we know we're going to have at least three new school board members come this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| So I do think just the thought of being able to think, okay, Susan and Patty are both interested in being chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| I can think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| And now it's just a Monday to Wednesday, you know, difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| I do think maybe that gets people, and they might even seek some outside counsel from people, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| and gives them the time to do that before just getting, well, Susan's interested, I didn't even know she was interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| that kind of thing, which I think is what's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| So in that way I do, I didn't, whatever you had suggested first, which was kind of the longer time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| almost like the month before, like August, I thought that was too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| But I do think the idea of just being able to leave and go, okay, those two are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| let me think about it and sort of think, you know, of my priorities or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| So I do, I can support this, and that's just my thought on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| I think those are good feedbacks, good feedback, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| And I like, Gary, the way you reworded that around discussion of potential nominees is encouraged at the September work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| There was comment, I think Ms. Bounds mentioned it, about like self-nominating, which really wasn't the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| It was really just us as a board having an open conversation in that, I mean, everything else on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| every meeting that we have, we have time to think about it before the meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Like this is the one thing that we do every year where we have really no time to think about it in terms of a specific action, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| Like we know we're going to vote, but we don't necessarily know whose names are going to pop up and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| So to me it was just a way for us to be more intentional in that decision-making process as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4656)|
| 1:17:43| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I think for a lot of reasons this is better than August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| And I think this is vague enough where it's really about us just having a conversation together about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| however it comes up, whether somebody says, hey, I'm interested, or somebody else says, hey, I think you should consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| I think the possibilities are pretty open in terms of how that discussion flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| I suppose that that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| We haven't done it that way in the past, but that would at least give you, what, 48 hours, so to speak, to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4701)|
| 1:18:32| If anybody, you know, wishes to announce their candidacy early, you know, you could do that a month ahead of time or more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4712)|
| 1:18:49| But, you know, it could be good or bad for whoever was, you know, whoever chose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4729)|
| 1:19:01| If you did it early, it would give, if people were opposed to you, it would give them time to develop opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4741)|
| 1:19:15| But as far as worrying about the three board members, new board members, I don't think that should be a big concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4755)|
| 1:19:25| because if you're running for school board and you win, you're successful and you win, hopefully you know a little about the present members on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4765)|
| 1:19:40| So it's not like you just see somebody, you know, point blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| You know a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| You may not know as much as you'd like to, but once you get selected by that, it will give you time to go back and read bios and read whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4789)|
| 1:20:02| So those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Well, I was just going to say we've concentrated on the people that want it, but actually the opposite is a good thing in that if somebody should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4814)|
| 1:20:24| the discussion takes place and somebody really doesn't want to serve, that you're thinking would be a great chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| then that person can say, hey, take me out of the running, and then you've got 48 hours to come up with somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4831)|
| 1:20:39| So I think that's a very big positive that we've just focused on who would be, but who doesn't want to be is also about as important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4839)|
| 1:20:50| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| I'm not saying I don't want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| I'm just saying that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Patty probably wins the award for awkwardness, because your very first board meeting, you missed that vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4860)|
| 1:21:08| and weren't you like the tiebreaker or something when you came back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| Mike and I both remember that very well where I was out of the country and my phone exploded when I got back to the States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4874)|
| 1:21:22| Yeah, I was the tiebreaker vote my very first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| So moving on, board policies, any discussion on C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4887)|
| 1:21:36| E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| G or H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| And I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| Going to grants, 9, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Just on A, and it can be general, the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| I'm just trying to figure out, is that $20 million, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| Does that seem to compare to our prior allocations, or is that much larger, much smaller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4922)|
| 1:22:10| Dr. Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| As far as historic, I want to ask Ms. Cheryl Martin to come up to address that, how our title amount compares with other years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4933)|
| 1:22:22| I think while she's coming up, I'll just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| I mean, it's $19.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I think it's important to note that $15.6 million of that's the Title I, which is the majority that spirals out to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| So just sometimes we think about what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Ms. Martin, and I'm not looking for specifics, I'm just trying to get a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| is this kind of in line with what we've expected in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Yes, yes, Mr. Watson, it is in line with what we usually get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Title I-A went up a little bit in the preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Title II-A went down just a tad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| Title IV went down just a little bit, and when I say a little bit, it's like a couple thousand or a couple hundred thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| about $100,000 with II-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Cheryl, before you go, do you mind just clarifying for them kind of the overview of what the A's are for people who don't like Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| Title II, Title III?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| So we get funding, Title I-A, and those are the school allocations that go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| We also get Title I-C, which is to serve migrant students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| We get Title I-N, which is students who are attending a neglected facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| We get Title I-D, which are students that we serve that are in a delinquent facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| We get II-A, which is professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| We get III, which is to serve our EL students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| And we get Title IV, which is well-rounded, safe and healthy, and technology that we can use across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5023)|
| 1:23:52| And thank you for all the ‑‑ I'm sure there's a lot of work to ensure that we're getting those and the compliance side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| I mean, the whole grant world, so thanks for all your work and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| So moving on to Grants 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| I think a lot of this grant revolves around certifying additional reading specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| Do we know what the status of that will be and how many will be certified at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| And does that happen this summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| Go ahead, Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| You can go ahead and come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| I'll have her speak to the details of it, but there is a portion that goes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| But I'll let her give you the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| So in our SR 3.0 plan, we have the original set of literacy specialists in our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5086)|
| 1:24:54| When we received the Best for All grant, we decided to add a few additional spots for the schools that have really large student numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5094)|
| 1:25:03| so that they would have a higher density of literacy specialists within their buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| so like a Farragut, a Karn, some of those bigger elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| So they would have one funded by ESSER and also one funded through this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Through Best for All, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| And so then does that cover all schools will then have reading specialists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| The goal with ESSER is that all schools will have a reading specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| This is giving us a chance to have some additional density with those schools that have much larger staffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| So grants item C or D, E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5137)|
| 1:25:49| Moving on to contracts, 10A or B, C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5149)|
| 1:26:03| And regular agenda items, 11A or B, C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5163)|
| 1:26:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| We were having some technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| I just want to make sure I'm in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| So you said C and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| Speaking of the school calendar, is that where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| If we can just speak to the early release days, I know there's been a lot of things in the news about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| A lot of people have been talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| If we can just have some conversation about the impact of that and how it got brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| This is one we're actually pretty excited for, and I can kind of give an overview of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| I know we have some principals and members of the committee in the crowd that could probably give some more context and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| So something that comes up every year, and I know Paula Hancock knows this too, when we were doing PECA collaborations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5220)|
| 1:27:08| there's always time, time for teachers to be able to get things done they need to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| If it's collaboration, professional development, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| And so our principal advisory group has kind of been kicking an idea around for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| and they brought formally to the grade level directors this year a proposal for early release time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| Probably around us the most familiar district is Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| They do that every Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| They have a release time for their teachers to be able to work and plan and work on their professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| So working with, again, the team, Guy Respos is incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| He's our calendar guy and does a lot of things reporting back to the state for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| That committee met multiple times and kind of put together a proposal that would cause the least amount of probably conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| with an existing calendar that's already been approved for next year and then potentially for the 23-24 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| So it would allow us to kind of pilot up to six days without us having to do, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| a whole lot of other conversations about how we use things like unscheduled in-service days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| Principals talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| They enjoy having the flexibility to be able to assign that to teachers for things they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| So to go beyond six days would require us to have to think a little differently about structuring some other parts of our calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| So six days gave us the easiest way to kind of test the concept for the next couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| And, again, I would say that's kind of the overall concept of how it came through our principal advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| and probably turn it over to anyone from the crowd there to answer questions that are specific to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| Thanks, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| So I've had some conversation with principals and some folks on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| and I appreciate the work that's gone into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| One of the things that I've heard in the community is, you know, what happens when kids get released early, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| We know what the teachers are now doing, but there's six more days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| So can you speak or somebody speak a little bit to the work that we've done with our after-school partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| and to help kind of fill in some of that gap because I want to make sure that the community understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| that we're trying to do all we can to help address any possible unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| I may actually ask Mr. Smith to come up and talk because I'll say we have met with after-school care providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| Ms. Thompson set up that meeting with us at Boys and Girls Club, and our major after-care providers all came to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| And we were able to kind of discuss dates and ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| and it was a concept they felt like they could support for us, you know, moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| and how would they adjust their staff on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| And it was actually received really well that they felt like as long as they knew the days in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| and as soon as it was approved, you know, by you all, that they could make that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| I think there was one contract adjustment that they have asked to do, and Ms. Thompson has been part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| For overall how that works and how that feels, you know, again, at Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| Mr. Smith has been doing that for probably close to a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| so I'd probably ask him if he wouldn't mind to step up and see kind of what that's looked like, if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| I've never said thank you, Madam Chair and Board, so I'll do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| So this is my third year at Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| and like Dr. Reislich said, Fulton's operated on an early release schedule for over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| So from a high school perspective, we have partnered with the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| They've continued to provide tutoring for kids that need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| We've worked with Ryan Dillingham in transportation, so that part's been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| Again, at the high school level, it's probably a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| but we've not really struggled with kids either getting their car and heading on home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| We've worked with transportation and those organizations that we've partnered with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| On any regular day, they continue to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| We've also used classified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| I'll speak a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| The benefits I've seen from our certified staff in giving them time to truly collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| So at Fulton High School, on every early release day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| teachers engage in professional learning communities, PLCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| So specific content areas, meeting, collaborating, looking at data, common assessments, planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5471)|
| 1:31:19| We are committed to implementing the high-quality instruction materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| So I know for this year, that's really been valuable to give them time to familiarize themselves with those materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| And then we've rotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| So you have PLC every Wednesday, and then we rotate through a structure of the other part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| So that early release could be a staff meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| You could have a department meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| We are divided up into five small learning communities already, so an SLC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| And then this year, we did add a professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| So one Wednesday a month, we have professional development for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| We've not really struggled with kids being around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| I would say the principal sets the tone for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| I know a lot of high school folks think, hey, our football team is going to be out there practicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| So the principal sets the expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I mean, folks are still on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| They have to meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| Once 345 hits, then they go about their business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| I think my bigger concern was around mainly elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| I think that's where the struggle will be the greatest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| Also know that as systems change, people get used to those systems changing, and they adjust accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| So I think in the beginning is where the struggle might be felt the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| And there are certainly places where we have pockets of lower-income single-parent families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5555)|
| 1:32:43| who are not in school districts that have robust after-school programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| We also know that there's teachers that end up having elementary school-age kids and got to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| But also know that in terms of an industry, professional development and time to plan is important to every industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| In education, it's particularly difficult because your full attention has to be given to our students during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| So I know it's a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| I mean, it's a problem that we need a solution to, and I appreciate the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| I just wanted to elevate some of the obvious challenges that are out there, but also appreciate the energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| especially to speak to our after-school providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| I think that's a big potential win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Ms. Bablin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Yes, just from talking to different people, I do support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| But I especially support that if we pass it on Wednesday that we get the communication out as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| not just putting a calendar out but really noting this to parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| Because I think the teachers and the principals I definitely hear support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| I think it is the elementary side that's worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| But I do think if you can plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| One of the things that was brought up to me was not the after-school care for elementary school kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| but if you have preschool children, the workers of preschool are now going to have to leave early to go get their children from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| Just kind of a ripple effect that I think the longer people have to plan this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| And then the other thing I would really like us to look at is, at the end of next year, how this went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| Because I know we have planning periods in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| but what we keep hearing is the teachers don't really get to use those planning periods as effectively as they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| that I do want us to know whether we really feel like these half days are very useful and being used for the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| Like the kids, the coaches aren't continuing with their practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| But then I do see, you know, I see things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| It's like, okay, you've got a ninth grader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| You have to pick your ninth grader up and then have to have them back at 345 to a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| So I do see all sorts of sort of complications, but I'm sure as Fulton has worked through it, the rest of the system will work through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| But I think the earlier we can commune it out to parents, this might not be ideal for parents, but it's just like tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| We have election days, which I still don't understand why they're in our schools, but we close for election day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| and usually it seems to be a big surprise for parents that it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| So, I mean, I do think it's not an unheard of thing, and the more notice parents have to plan, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5709)|
| 1:35:17| Mr. Chin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| I do think this, I mean, if teachers can effectively use this as a planning period, it would be greatly beneficial for the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| But, of course, I guess an issue with this is already in many classrooms, time is extremely valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| and taking out six half days from students having the opportunity to learn is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| So I guess if anyone could speak to, you know, how, you know, to what extent that might be an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| or if there are other ways to remedy that perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| Dr. Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| So I would say, again, I mean, if anyone from the committee wants to step up, the question is really around, I mean, I'm happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| I'll take a shot, but I'm talking the whole time, and I'm not really even on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| So the question from Mr. Chin was, it's six days where, or six half days or six couple hours where students would not be learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5762)|
| 1:36:10| they'll be out of the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| So just addressing that or thinking through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| I think my initial thought would be, and maybe Mr. Respos could speak to this, but, you know, when you talk about days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5774)|
| 1:36:22| it gets kind of tricky when you start thinking about inclement weather days and the days we go to school and the hours we miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| and all those kinds of things, I mean, that we go our set amount of days, but we earn our days by going more hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| So, say, in the big scheme of things, it's not much of a loss on that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| There are things that we could do even more creatively, again, to use that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5801)|
| 1:36:49| I'm trying, like, not to get too bogged down in how we get to the 180 days and how we get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| but I'm saying, yes, there are, from the calendar we have right now, will there be fewer hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| Yes, there will be slightly fewer hours to do that, and there's some tradeoff for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| but we still exceed what the state requires by far in the hours that we attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| and we feel like this would be a good chance for teachers to be able to use some of that time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| to be able to be more impactful and have a greater effect in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| All right, wait, Guy is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| Madam Chair, members of the Board, it's good to be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| I'm Guy Respos with the Information Technology Department, Data Manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| and one of my responsibilities is to submit the calendar to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| So, as Dr. Roswick said, we have 180 days that we have to have of instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| but actually we have 177 instructional days and then three professional development days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5860)|
| 1:37:47| that count toward that 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Those are days like tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| They're in the calendar, and they're kind of a replacement for instructional time to get us to that 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| So what we're talking about doing here is taking two additional stockpiled days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5881)|
| 1:38:08| and think of it, we talk about half days, but think about really when you look at the time that's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| they're really one-third days, you know, just getting technical about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| And so we're taking two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| Each of those days is three early release times, early release days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| So we have two days that result in those six early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| and that leaves us with eight stockpiled days left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| So I just wanted to kind of set the table there with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5919)|
| 1:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| So do we have other administrators here tonight too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| I don't know if they wanted to speak to it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| I've heard from a few of mine this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| Good evening, Madam Chair, Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| I'm Desiree Jones, and I always say that I'm blessed to be the principal of Vine Middle Magnet School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5950)|
| 1:39:16| The number one reason I'm blessed is because of my students, and the number two reason is because of my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| And so I believe that this early release is giving time back to a staff, my staff that works really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5961)|
| 1:39:29| I was privileged to be an assistant principal at Fulton, and we were doing early release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| and the level of professionalism and the way those teachers used that time was very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5973)|
| 1:39:41| And I know my staff would use it for the good of their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| To your question, Mr. Jinn, about time, I think it goes to working smarter, not harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| I think if teachers know and have time to, for example, analyze data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| For us, we are a state-designated school for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| And what we've been doing this year especially is we have been analyzing student data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| We've been sharing it with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| We've been sharing it with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| And next year, we want to push it forward to sharing it with parents and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| My teachers, a lot of their plan periods are lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| It's not because we are, you know, just calling them to useless meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| As we know from the pandemic and from recent years, you know, social emotional health is a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| And so we have increased IEP meetings, increased ST meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| We're meeting for students, and we're not meeting just to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| Our teachers do attend PLCs every week, and we do professional development on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| But my teachers also work a heck of a lot after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| And I know Mr. Dupler can probably speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| If our teachers build like lawyers do, we would be paying them a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| And I know my teachers work all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| And so I just think this is treating our staff as professionals and giving them some time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| It's not going to make them work any less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| I think they will still, my staff at least, will fill in that time doing more for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| I just think it's just something we do for professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6078)|
| 1:41:26| Madam Chair and members of the board, my name is Lynn White, and I'm the principal at Farragut Primary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| So I can kind of speak to the elementary perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| I want to add to what Seth and Desiree said as far as that professional development for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| I have a huge staff, and it is very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| I have a huge staff, and it is very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| While we meet in PLCs in eight or nine teachers at a time, it is very challenging to pull my whole staff together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6105)|
| 1:41:52| even to pull a whole grade level together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| So this would give us the opportunity to work between grade levels, even to pull a whole grade level together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| As Desiree said, if we're going to do that, we have to do it after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| So in that perspective, my teachers are very excited about this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| As far as the kids and child care, our child care providers are on board with picking the children up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6129)|
| 1:42:18| We have an onsite child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| They would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| My teachers can just keep their kids or go get their kids and come back and keep them with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6143)|
| 1:42:31| So as far as child care hurdles, and I don't remember who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| but to speak to if we give them enough notice, you know, we're off tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| We have half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| And parents generally, as long as they know about it, they're prepared for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| The other thing, yes, on any given day, any of us could have kids that are left after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| Someone forgot to pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| So we just hold on to them and we take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| It's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| So all those questions, those are things my teachers generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| When I spoke to parents in my building, they asked those same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| So we were able to kind of think through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| And speaking to other elementary principals, they had, you know, similar questions, and we were able to address all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| So I feel like with a lot of information on the front end, our parents would be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| And as Desiree said, communicating to the parents and the community too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| This is what we're using this time for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| This is how it's growing our kids and how it's growing our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| So we communicate that clearly, and as much as we can, I think they'll see that positive outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6211)|
| 1:43:40| Thank you. Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| I think it's important to note, and our guy from R&D can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| but just so parents understand, if we still would have eight days in the calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| and then we would be using two of our inclement weather days to offset these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| So if we used more than eight days, we would then add those days to the end of the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| or somewhere else in the calendar in an emergency situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| It is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| There's also flexibility because Guy's a mastermind of the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| So if we have a real bad winter and we know in January things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| we can always suspend later early release days to get those inclement weather days back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| Am I correct on that, Guy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| So it seems like when you look at the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| because I've heard from just a couple of parents who are concerned about the same thing that Mr. Jen raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| the question about learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| I'm hoping that in the end it's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| I know I heard from one principal who said their principals are held accountable to moving the needle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| but if we're expecting them to do that in the same manner, it may not be able to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| So hopefully this is giving time to school-level professional development that will then impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| and be a positive impact for student academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| And that's another thing that I just wanted to ask and make sure I'm clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| So typically when we have professional development days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| those are typically system-wide development days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| And this would be more school-based so that they are actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| so it's kind of a whole different animal, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| The current in-service days, they are divided up between school-based and district-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| but there are more district-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| But I think there's two, I'm looking at Shannon, two maybe in-service days at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| Maybe three if you count the one at the beginning of the school year, but that's kind of getting ready for school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| So there really aren't, once you get into in-service days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| there really aren't times for schools to work on individual plans and individual professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Come on, Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| I think the interesting thing to point out here, too, though, is that those days for the schools are so far apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| it's hard for them to get on a trajectory of learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| where what they have set up with this would allow a school to run a plan to be able to affect that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| So that's a big difference in the way this is set up that I think will have a very positive impact on student outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| And I've heard from teachers who have said that they feel like they could learn a lot from the other teachers in their building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| if they just had the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| So I feel like it's going to be a huge positive for those teachers who have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| who have great ideas to share if they just have that opportunity to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| So I think it can have really positive outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| So I'm excited about that for the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| I've talked to a lot of teachers about this, and looking at the expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| the expectations for teachers and staff is to have a protected day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| And the concern I have there is that we expect our teachers to protect that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| but I'm not seeing that under the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| And there's a lot of concern that administrators may feel pressured to put in additional professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6441)|
| 1:47:31| for the sake of having additional professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| And I think we need to stress to our administrators that this is time to do those things that they don't have time to do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6455)|
| 1:47:45| not to bring in more to put on the teacher's plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| I want to see this taking things off of the teacher's plate, not putting more on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| If it ends up being something that puts more on, then that's something that I would really strongly object to in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6475)|
| 1:48:03| if that's what it turns out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| And under the expectations for secondary administrators and staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| it says all staff engaged, and then says meetings, collaboration, supervision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| I don't see planning. I don't see individual planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6499)|
| 1:48:27| And those are things that our teachers very much need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| So what I hear when I'm listening to administrators and teachers are some very different expectations from school to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6511)|
| 1:48:39| I hear some talking about giving that time back that we've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| and I hear others talking about this great opportunity to bring in a lot more PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| And I think we need to make very clear at the district level exactly what our expectation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6531)|
| 1:48:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Thank you, Madam Chair. Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| One is I think giving time back to our teachers for professional development and planning is going to help the time that our students are in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6551)|
| 1:49:20| When you're hanging on by a thread and you don't have time to do all those types of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| it makes it harder, I think, to do what you really want to in instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| I'm not really concerned about the 12 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| I think I'd feel differently if it was like 40 hours or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| But I also know that this is being talked about a little bit like as a pilot, like let's try this out for two years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| So where do we think this might go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| If this goes well, is it increasing the number of days at some point, probably not getting to Oak Ridge where it's once a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| but is it moving it to eight to ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Is it like if this works, where does it go from here potentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| Ms. Bounds. Dr. Reiswick, did you want to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| That was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| No, I would think that's the beauty of being a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| So I think if we do get to a place that, you know, seeing better student outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| teachers are getting things done, school's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| And I will say this, I do think that's the beauty of this, that schools have very little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| You know, they have plans, too, and they're working toward things as a staff and trying to grow as a staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| but we don't give them the time to do that because there's textbook adoptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| and there's all these other kinds of things that take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| So I think we learn from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| We're in this place, you know, a year from now we'll have a year of that data under our belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| If it's a snafu and we've got five reports of kids that didn't get picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| and reports from teachers at the time not working and all that kind of thing, I think then we kind of go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| well, you know, we tried and we didn't totally adjust a calendar down to an Oak Ridge kind of schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| I think if it is positive and we've got another year that it's out there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| I think we can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| I mean, I would suggest that we take it back to the schools and let them kind of say, you know, what do you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| The next stage, and, again, it's where a guy like Guy comes in handy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| would be that we might have to restructure some things and look at some things different on the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| you know, some of those like unscheduled in-service or district-wide in-service days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| which all can be game to be looked at to expand days without necessarily giving up instructional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| So I think those are probably the next places we look to see what's the right mix if we need to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6685)|
| 1:51:33| Ms. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| I think Ms. Owen raised a valid point that there's probably a different expectation from educators versus administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| And then as we heard from Mr. Smith, I mean, there are a lot of meetings that Ms. Owen and I can attest to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6705)|
| 1:51:56| I mean, you've got staff meetings, professional development meetings, department meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| grade-level meetings, professional learning community meetings, and then teachers going to IEPs and other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6722)|
| 1:52:11| And then let's not forget that over the last couple of years there are a lot of teachers that gave up their planning time to be in classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6731)|
| 1:52:23| because of the shortage with substitutes, and so some teachers got very little planning time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6743)|
| 1:52:32| To speak to the student missing out, I think actually this could be a great opportunity for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6752)|
| 1:52:41| especially at the high school level where they could work on group projects and cohorts and then independently with research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6761)|
| 1:52:49| So I don't see that as necessarily a negative, but a way that they could work outside of the classroom together to get some of that work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6769)|
| 1:53:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Thank you. Mike McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| Thank you. I don't know, I guess anybody could answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| The state requires a minimum amount of instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6793)|
| 1:53:24| It used to be that it was three hours and 15 minutes, or is it still that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6804)|
| 1:53:33| It's less than four hours, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| If it's okay, I'd like to ask Guy Ress to step up. He's our expert on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| I believe it is less than four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| It's half the state mandated day, but I know that also boards of education have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6832)|
| 1:54:03| I think there's been a little latitude there for boards of education to require they go at least half the school district's day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6843)|
| 1:54:14| even if it's a little longer, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| Well, I know this has been quite a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| but in order for an athlete to participate in a ball game that night or whatever the event was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6862)|
| 1:54:34| it didn't have to be a ball game, it could have been something musical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| But if they had a dentist appointment or doctor appointment or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| they used the three hours and 15 minutes that they had to be there for instruction in order for them to qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6886)|
| 1:54:57| Now maybe that was a local rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| but they always said that the state recognized that for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6900)|
| 1:55:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| And I assume that that was something similar with these inclement weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| I know a lot of these really rural counties, you'll see where they frequently go two hours late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6917)|
| 1:55:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| And what we're talking about here is on these early release days is a five hour day for high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6929)|
| 1:55:36| and a four hour and 45 minute day for elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| So that would meet that standard for the purposes of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6946)|
| 1:55:53| So is there any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Okay, so moving on to item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| Item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| Or item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6971)|
| 1:56:19| So on item G, our calendar, the Board of Education calendar, we did switch it to a Monday-Thursday schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6979)|
| 1:56:34| That in part was to address that concern that you have voiced, Mr. Watson, about you're here on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| and then you have that one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| Still not an incredible amount of time, but it was kind of a compromise there with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| I've heard from several people who have said that they would attend more meetings if they weren't on Wednesday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7010)|
| 1:56:59| So I do think that helps some of their parents who might run youth programs at church and those kind of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7019)|
| 1:57:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I appreciate the change and I think that will be a healthy rhythm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| and also to know of parents who run into that issue, especially on Wednesday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| I have some concerns and hope that we'll reach out to our principals regarding the Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| Lots of our schools have programs on Tuesdays and Thursdays to avoid Wednesdays specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7053)|
| 1:57:40| and I think this definitely takes out some of our ability to attend those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7060)|
| 1:57:46| but also takes out the ability of teachers to be here for these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7066)|
| 1:57:55| I don't know, is there any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| I always want teachers to come and I want parents to come and everything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| but right now we're Monday and Wednesday and we don't have tons of people showing up on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| So I don't know if there's all of a sudden a big group that's coming on Wednesday that will be prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| I think it's important to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| but right now we're not having tons of parents and teachers coming to our meetings on Monday or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7099)|
| 1:58:26| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| I think all these things are things to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| Which day of the week is better for any of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| So with no more discussion on that, Ms. Satterfield, do we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| We do not have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Anyone signed up for public forum today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| So moving on to board forum, Mr. Chin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| Yeah, so kind of towards our high school students at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| I know AP's testing starts this week, goes on through next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| and as well as any makeup tests that are in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| I just want to say, you know, good luck to all those high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| You've done a great job throughout this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| You've learned a lot, and now it's time to kind of show what you've been able to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| but also make sure, you know, get enough rest, eat a good breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| all that stuff to ensure that you can test as well as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| And kind of towards all of our other students and also the teachers, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| It's been a long year, but we're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| You've done a great job as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| Just keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| And once we get to the summer break, take a little, you know, do relax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| recharge your brain, you know, and get ready for the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Yes, I just wanted to highlight a great celebration that we had in District 1 on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| as we celebrated just the career of Ms. Malika Guthrie at Austin East Magna High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7183)|
| 1:59:49| She's retiring this year, and she is the sole, I don't even know how to, like, describe her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| but she's been in Knox County, Austin specifically, and Vine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| supporting West African and teaching our students West African dance and all kinds of dances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| So they had a huge sold-out event at Bijou Theater on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| That was an amazing time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| The alumni came back and celebrated and gave her her flowers while she's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| So I want to say thank you to those that supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| and thank you for KCS for supporting the media release with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| It was a really great event and a great time for District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| I just wanted to say thank you to you guys and also to our tech team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| since I wasn't able to be here last Wednesday for the budget meeting because I was out on assignment for my other role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| But the tech team just went over and above to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| and so now we got it all fixed, and I think that they just did an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| And I just wasn't able to say that at the end of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| but I just really appreciated all their efforts because they just worked tirelessly to get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| So I appreciate you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| All right, meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-220502?start=7265)|
