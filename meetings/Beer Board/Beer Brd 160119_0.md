| 0:00:40| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| I thank you. Before we begin, I'd like to introduce Scott Payne, who is the new director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| of the Metropolitan Drug Commission. Mr. Payne, would you stand so we'll know who you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| and as we direct people to the MDC, they'll know who you are, too. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| I have a few announcements. When I call the name of business that's applying for the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| you need to come to the podium, state your name and address for the record. Applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| if you get your permit approved tonight, you need to see Ms. Dyer or Ms. Day right over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| here, and they will have the permit ready for you. Applicants who are approved pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| final documentation, you will have to get your permits at the business tax office when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| they're ready. Beer board members, we're still saving trees. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| Now, I have something that we need to think about, or we need to do. At the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| the last beer board meeting, the VIP event center applied for a beer permit, and we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| not grant that permit. I'd like us to have a motion to reconsider their application based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=105)|
| 0:01:54| on a lot of new information that has come about since that last meeting. Do I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| motion? So moved. So moved. Second. Okay, all those in favor? Aye. All right, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| you. Now, VIP event center, Fahd, you're here. Just stay seated. You're at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| agenda tonight because your company is the last one. All right, now, but you're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=127)|
| 0:02:14| on the agenda tonight, which is a good sign. Okay, the first group is the Archer's Barbeque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| at 408 South Gay Street. Now, you all have been in the paper quite a bit, so we're expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=139)|
| 0:02:26| you to serve barbeque tomorrow because it's cold. We're not quite there yet. My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| William Archer Bagley III, for the record. My home address is 6500 Clary Lane, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| Tennessee, 37919. I'm the majority owner of Archer's Barbeque. We've had a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| in Farragut for 17 months and a beer permit in Bearden since July of 2012. We've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| had any infractions or complaints. We're seeking a beer permit tonight for the new space at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| 408 South Gay Street. It's a space that's been vacant for 30 years, and we're real happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| to actually get in there and breathe some life back into it. Well, we're eager for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| to get in there, but before we do that, Sergeant Hunter, is the record check complete? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| no record. Ms. Dyer? We need the Health Department, Fire Prevention, and Building Inspection approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| They're finishing up the construction in Soterio this week. We expect to have those hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| by the end of the week, the first of next week. We're shooting to open up the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| week of February. Okay, well we'll hope that that happens. Do I have a motion? Move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| approve pending prior documentation. Okay, and we have a second. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Aye. Alright, and it'll be the same fair that we have at the other Great Archer's locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| is that right? Yes, ma'am. Okay, but we're excited that you're coming to make an old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| space new. Thank you. Good luck, and you can, when you get these inspections all done, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| can go to the beer, to the business office to pick up your permit. You don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| come back to us. Okay. Thank you. Okay, next on the list is the Crown & Goose, Aubrey's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=236)|
| 0:04:03| Incorporated at 123 South Central. And you all will have lots of good publicity in tomorrow's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=243)|
| 0:04:12| new Sentinel, I see. Randy Burleson, 421 Echo Valley Road, Knoxville, Tennessee. Okay, Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| Hunter. No record. Ms. Dyer. We need a copy of the sales tax registration, a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| of zoning from MPC, the Building Inspection fire prevention approvals, and the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| from the former owner. So, do I hear a motion? Move to approve, pending prior documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| Second. All those in favor? Aye. Okay. Are you, will you tell us, is the Crown & Goose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| going to be the Crown & Goose we know? Is there going to be a change? It will be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Crown & Goose you know. Okay. We like it. We're big fans, so. Okay, good enough. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| you, thank you. I have a question. Yes, sir. I have a question. Yes, sir. Are you, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| you buying the business? Are you buying the facilities, the buildings? For now, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| buying the business. We will have an option to buy the building at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Okay, fine. Thank you. Parking, we have to work on parking. That's what we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| on, so. Just one more. Councilman De La Vue. Yeah, just curious, are you going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| any more modestly priced fare? It's a great pub, great surroundings, sometimes a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| pricey. Yes, sir. I would agree with you 1,000%. I would say, given our experiences at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| locations in town, I do not feel our other restaurants are that expensive, so I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| agree with you. It's that Euro Metro thing. I mean, we just want regular pub food. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| We're all East Tennesseans. We love Knoxville, so yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| would just like an extra piece of fish. Tell me where you'll be tomorrow. We'll get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| fish. Okay, thank you. I would also just say, be careful where you get your advice. He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| a lawyer, a lawyer with TVA, so I don't know what kind of restaurant experience he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| so I'll work on it. Mine is on the consuming end, the council. Well, thank you, Mr. Brilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| Good luck with your new adventure. Thank you. Next is the Dollar General store on Amherst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| Road. We did that already, didn't we? Didn't we do that? No, they didn't get their stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| done. They never, okay, they never got it open. They are open now, they're just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| selling beer. Okay. At least I hope not. You're correct. Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=379)|

| 0:06:39| Ms. Dyer. We need the building inspection and fire prevention approvals. Okay, but she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| has those in her pocket, she looks like that. Okay, this is in my district, so I move to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| approve pending final documentation. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Thank you. Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| I have the, some of the neighbors were not real excited about that store coming to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| location, but I've had several emails and they're all excited about it and they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| to know when you'll sell beer. So you're off on the right track with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| Thank you. Next is the Drake's on Morrell Road. They've had lots of construction going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=430)|
| 0:07:21| on. And they're hiring. Tony Kolaksei for Drake's, 242 Morrell Road, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=441)|

| 0:07:52| burgers, beer, sushi. It's one of those, you said pub food, it's similar like that, craft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| beers, and then sushi, it's going over where the old playhouse used to be. Very excited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| very, very excited. Okay, that sounds good. Yes. Madam Chair, you mentioned they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| hiring. How many people do you expect to employ there? I'm curious. Well, actually, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| hiring, but since the awesome coverage you've had with local television shows, I mean TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| channels, and I had to do a cooking segment, and we've had a few things in the paper, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| we've hired about 106 people, and we are, while we're wrapping up right now, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| the last day that we will be taking any kind of interviews. All right, thank you. Dan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| I hope you're serving when I go there. I expect a double tip from you. No way. Okay, next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=511)|
| 0:08:41| is the Holston Hills Country Club on Holston Hills Road. This is in your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| is that right? Yes, it is. I can hit it with a stone if I have to. Oh, no, you might break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| a window. Name and address, please. My name is James Disney, 5600 Colonial Circle, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| Okay, thank you. Sergeant Hunter? No applicable record. Mrs. Dyer? We need the permit from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| the former owner. I have it with me. Okay, great. Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Any big changes, or we're continuing to operate? We're continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| to operate. We're being owned by McConnell Golf out of North Carolina, so we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| for some great improvements coming down the pipe. New greens, new fairways and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Well, the golf course is in excellent shape. We're looking to improve the building. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| building has issues there. That's right. Okay, well, good luck and thank you. Oh, wait, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| have a question. Yes, sir. There was something crossed out and noted, but I take it you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| not having any off-premise sales, it's just you're serving in the restaurant and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| ninth hole. That's right. Same as always. Thank you. All right, good luck. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| Next is the Moe's Original Barbecue, owned by Laughing Dog LLC. I find that name amusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=589)|
| 0:10:00| They have asked to have a postponement until March. They have a distance issue and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| have applied for a TABC permit and they do not expect that to be ready until March. Moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| to postpone. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Okay, so we are moving to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| to March the 15th. Save those trees, gentlemen. And also on the front sheet it should say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| District 2, not District 6. All right. You're so jealous of that stuff. Hey, if it's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| my district, it's in my district. He's still working on rezoning University Commons. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| right. It's in my district. Okay, next is Mulligan's on North Peters Road and I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=635)|
| 0:10:43| to Mr. Anderson with Mulligan's today and they have a large number of issues to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| resolve. They're going to the old Sonny's Barbecue location and they've had to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| new water pipes, all new electric, new gas lines, and now as they are moving closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| they now have to put in a sprinkler system. So he was optimistic that they would be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=661)|
| 0:11:11| in the spring. So I think we need to postpone this. And they also have to get their fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=671)|
| 0:11:19| and background checked. Just like April and May. I'd say that we can postpone this until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| March the 15th. So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Thank you. That's in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| also, just so you know. Okay, let's not worry about whose district is where. The next one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=690)|
| 0:11:41| is the University of Tennessee Medical Center Special Event, an Evening in Orange. And this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=701)|

| 0:11:55| Okay, thank you. Sergeant Hunter? No record. Ms. Dyer? The file is complete. Okay, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| want to tell us before we vote about the Night in Orange? Sure. This year, an Evening in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Orange will benefit cancer research at the hospital and our goal is to raise over $3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| million. Right now we're about $2.1 million of the way there, so it'll be a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| And we'll have about 400 guests. All right, thank you. Do I have a motion? So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| All those in favor? Aye. Well, good luck with the event, and I know we'll see it covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| on TV. Thanks. Next is the VIP Event Center. Give us your name and address, please. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=747)|
| 0:12:41| ma'am. My name is Fouad Rivez, 104 South David Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922. Okay, Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| Hunter? No applicable record. Ms. Dyer? We need a copy of the sales tax registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| and the building inspection and health department approvals. Okay, do I hear a motion? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| Second. All those in favor? Aye. Pending final document. Oh, I'm sorry, pending the TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| Now, tell us about, I gave a little bit of your stuff away, but you're applying for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| catering permit, is that correct? Yes, ma'am, that's correct. Okay. We have an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| in file. Okay, and TABC is the one who approves those, and then the distributors and wholesalers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| also want them to have a beer permit from us. And that resolves the objection of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| last time of the proximity of a church, right? Yes. Okay, thank you. Yes. I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| about that. Yes, sir. The last time, the AME Zion Church was the closest church. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| And now we're saying it's the Bearden United Methodist. Well, we're still saying it's AME| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Zion. This application has the incorrect church, but the TABC license will overcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| that distance. Thank you. Councilman Grieve. Yeah. Vice Mayor Grieve. Mr. Grieve. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| you. I just want to say that, to let the rest of my colleagues know, that we did have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| meeting last night. It was not required, but it was one that the folks requested that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| wanted to let the neighbors know, as well as the Bearden Council, in terms of what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| agenda is going to be, and that really, basically, they knew the history of what we've dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| with there. And Ms. Palmer, I was glad that you were there to be able to add, and Finbar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Saunders was there. But we really appreciate that, where you reached out to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| and to the Bearden Council. And it's obvious that it's going to be a good relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and that everyone is starting off on a good foot. So, if you'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Yes, sir. And I want to thank all of you all for being there and encouraging this. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| really, that's just the first step, not the only one. And we talked about the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| being able to, on a monthly meeting, too, they have our numbers. Also, too, was speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=881)|
| 0:14:47| with Mr. Payne about being able to come over to the staff and help us into the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| of how to identify certain things that we don't want in our event. So, it's just, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| what we're trying to do. And it was really good, because the neighbors had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| to express what their concerns were and what you all took under advisement. So, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| a good meeting. I appreciate it. Do I have a motion to approve this pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| TABC catering permit? Yes. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Good luck. We'll look forward to a big event center happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Thank you, ma'am. A good kickoff would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Sir? A good kickoff would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| Hopefully we can do that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| All right. The only other business before the beer board. Oh, no, there is one other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=928)|
| 0:15:41| The Cholo Taqueria on Gay Street. Is there anybody here from Cholo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| When we approved them subject to final documentation on October 27th, they had a number of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=948)|
| 0:15:58| to do to get ready. Ms. Day, Ms. Dyer, have you all heard anything from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Other than the signature, we mailed a certified letter and the signature card was returned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| as they received it, but we haven't had any communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Mr. Frost. Thank you. I often take a downtown lunchtime walk, and I've walked by there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| and it appears to me that they've been working on the premises, if that matters to the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| of the beer board. Maybe that's like some others, that when you get into an established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| building, there are many surprises in store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Councilman Dellavopi, I know you're just dying to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| No, I'm just listening with rapt attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Oh, well, thank you, sir. Okay, the only other business before us tonight, do we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| vote on February the 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| That's the postponement date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| So we hope they're done by February the 16th. Okay. Now, finally, the only other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| is that the response indicates that March the 10th is the date of the long-awaited beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| board workshop, and we will have an agenda out well before that. Mr. Frost has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| that you submit items. There are three items that have been submitted so far. One has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| do with distance issues. One has to do with the task class. One has to do with the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| check. And I would encourage everybody to go online, read the application for a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1051)|
| 0:17:39| permit, and go to the last page of the application, and some questions could be answered by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| time. So having no other business, March 10th will be our next workshop, and February the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| 16th will be our next beer board meeting. We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160119?start=1071)|
