| 0:03:00| explicitly say that during these Zoom meetings. I can't just, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| really say the name, so I'll do my best, but raise your hand maybe if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| making the motion, if I can see that. Okay, so any motion made and seconded on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=189)|

| 0:04:08| postponement? Vice Mayor McKenzie. Yes, Mayor, I'd like to move for item 12B to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=248)|

| 0:04:33| postponement. I look forward to many discussions between now and then. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| please, Mr. Johnson, please take a roll call vote. Actually, Mayor, we did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| one person signed up to speak on this. If Council wanted to hear from him now, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| may also be available to speak at public forum at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| Council members, would you like to hear this person speak now? I wouldn't mind hearing him now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| Okay, that sounds good, and whoever's operating the clock, I mean, I can, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=299)|
| 0:05:07| do it myself here on my phone. I'll just do it on my phone. Okay, we have Philip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| Reyes. I will allow him to speak and unmute him. Okay. Mr. Reyes, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=312)|
| 0:05:23| being here. I can't see you. Can you say something so we know that you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| Yes, ma'am. Can you all hear me? Yeah. Well, if you could just go ahead and start by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| saying your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| to speak. This is Philip Reyes, and I live at 3400 Fountain Park here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| Tennessee, and just wanted to discuss, or what I wanted to talk about was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| postponement, and I had prepared something, and I was not prepared for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| June 2nd date, but I had wanted to say, Mayor Kincannon, City Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| thank you all for allowing me to speak. I come wholeheartedly requesting each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| of you to consider postponing the ordinance, which you already have, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| would like to postpone until our social distancing. I just don't think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| have enough with what's going on that until the social distancing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| restrictions are eased. I'm unsure if even the June time frame, I know it gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| us plenty of time to conduct meetings, but we can't get together and sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| and do this, and I think there are restrictions of virtual meetings, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| just like what we're seeing here, it's been a contentious debate, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| think virtual meetings are a good place for this, and I feel that we need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| work groups, and we need more discussion that's going to ultimately affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| employees. I don't want to talk about or debate what's at hand, I just think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| need to look at those guidelines, because today we got more guidelines as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| employee, now we need to wear masks and different things, and I mean there's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| a whole lot of things our employees are worried about, and this, if we can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| move it a little further down the road, which I applaud the June the 2nd is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| good date to look at, but we may have to go more, and I'm hoping this council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| open and the mayor's open for that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Reyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=437)|
| 0:07:27| Are there any other people signed up to speak about this postponement? No ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Okay, then please take a roll call vote, and this is your voting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| postponement June 2nd. Vice Mayor McKenzie? Yes. Councilwoman Parker? Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=456)|
| 0:07:49| Ryder? Yes. Councilman Roberto? Yes. Councilman Singh? Yes. Councilman Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=469)|
| 0:08:03| Councilman Testament? Yes. Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| You have to hold the space bar down. Hold the space bar down. Yes, sorry. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=490)|
| 0:08:24| Councilman Fugate? Yes. That was nine in favor, ma'am. Okay, thank you. Are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=504)|
| 0:08:35| any other items for, so the motion is postponed till June 2nd. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| other items for postponement? Okay, seeing none, any items requested to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| Mayor, I think Councilperson Singh had something she wanted to add. I just unmuted myself. We can finish with this, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| wanted you to, if you wouldn't mind, just address the HR issue a bit. Just a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| general idea of what it is. There's a lot of misinformation out there, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| we really need to begin the discussion. Maybe here is the place, just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| beginning of it. Well, Councilwoman Singh, I agree that we do need a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| discussion, but since it's already been postponed, and there's a council workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| scheduled for next Thursday, and we have a pretty full agenda, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| prefer to save the substantive discussion for next week's council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| That's fine. Just in the interest of saving our energy for the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| agenda. Okay, are there any items that people would like to add by motion? Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=573)|
| 0:09:44| how about, is there a consent agenda? Is there a motion on the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| Move to approve. Second. Okay, motion made by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| Councilwoman Singh. Please take a roll call vote, or did you have a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| anybody? Please take a roll call vote. Mr. Johnson. Vice Mayor McKenzie. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| Councilwoman Parker. If you hold the space bar down, we can hear you. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=610)|
| 0:10:23| Councilman Ryder. Yes. Councilman Roberto. Yes. Councilman Singh. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=623)|
| 0:10:37| Councilman Smith. Yes. Councilman Testerman. Yes. Councilman Thomas. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=637)|
| 0:10:47| Councilman Fugate. Yes. Nine in favor, ma'am. Okay, moving on to the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=647)|
| 0:10:59| report. First, I want to thank council members, the Recorder's Office, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Information Systems Team, and CTV for making it possible to meet electronically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| and this is our second time doing this, and I think it's getting a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| smoother each time. There were a few technical limitations at first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| and I think we are resolving those. We put out an update and instructions last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| week on the city website and on social media for how people could address City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Council tonight. So for those who haven't heard, to speak at future meetings until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| we're able to meet face-to-face and we don't know when those restrictions will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| change, please contact City Recorder's Office by 5 p.m. on meeting days. I'm Will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| Johnson and his team will make sure to take your contact information and allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| you to speak during the meeting via Zoom, just the way Mr. Reyes just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| did. This is a temporary, you know, good faith effort to balance the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| transparency and engagement while also practicing social distancing recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| by health officials. This also adheres to the Open Meetings Act, which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| amended by Governor Lee, recognizing the COVID-19 threat. So for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| ever in the history of this state, electronic meetings of City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| other legislative bodies are allowed. Friday, April 10th, is a city holiday and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| city offices will be closed, just as a FYI. The city's contractor for garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| and recyclables pickup, Waste Connections, will be running its normal routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| Downtown trash and recyclables will be picked up following regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| schedules over this Easter weekend, and the five recycling drop-off centers will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| be open Friday, April 10th, but the solid waste facility on Elm Street will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| closed on Friday. And starting this month, just on the solid waste front, the solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| waste facility is going to be closed every Saturday, and starting Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| April 9th, the household hazardous waste drop-off side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| transfer station will be closed, and both of these are measures to slow the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| of COVID-19. Okay, so now I want to recognize a few people before we get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=786)|
| 0:13:20| to some topics related to COVID-19. I want to recognize several people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| making a huge difference, have made a huge difference, or are continuing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| make a huge difference in our city. First of all, Bill Lyons retired last Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| after serving under four different mayors. We thank him for his lasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| impact on the city and all who live and work here. He's just done a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| and I really appreciate his willingness to help me as I transition to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| mayor these first three months or so. So thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Bill Lyons. Maybe you're watching. If so, hello and thank you. I also wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| announce and thank Clarence Vaughn, who has been Executive Director of PARCC since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| 2016, and he is leaving to become the Director of Diversity at University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| Tennessee Haslam College of Business. Clarence, if you are watching, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| for your countless hours of work to make sure citizens of our community have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| a voice in police matters. This is a great opportunity for him. I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| been happy to have him stay on as PARCC Executive Director, but it was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| opportunity that he wanted to pursue, and I congratulate him and wanted to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| council members know that I've appointed Ola Blackman-McBride to serve as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Interim PARCC Director, and the position is posted, and interested candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| should apply. The information is on the city website, and the positions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| applications are going to be accepted through April 13th. So that's the PARCC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| Director open position. I also have happy news as I've appointed Mark Parker to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| serve as the city's new Chief Technology Officer. You all know Mark. He's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| reason we have Zoom here today, and he's been serving in the acting role in his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| work for the city through information services for many years, and has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| instrumental in keeping the city running during this pandemic. But I was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| impressed with his work even before the pandemic, and I think he's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| great Chief Technology Officer for us. So thank you and congratulations to Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Parker. I also want to mention that, as you guys know, Jim Hagerman retired at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=919)|
| 0:15:28| end of March, or towards the end of March, and I've named Steve King as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Acting Director of City Engineering, and I want to thank Steve for his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| willingness to step forward as an Interim Acting Director during this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| critical time. He's obviously had a lot of experience and is going to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Engineering Department moving forward smoothly until I appoint a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| Director for Engineering. I also, in sad news, wanted to take a moment to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| Mack Goodwin. Conrad Mack Goodwin was serving his second term as Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| on the Knoxville Planning Commission. He was also President of Town Hall East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| Neighborhood Association and involved in many other organizations in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| Mack is a friend of mine and my family's too. He and his wife, Lydia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| introduced us to the country of Slovenia and was one of the reasons we ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| spending a year over there, and he's just a wonderful person and a great community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| servant. So he passed away a few days ago after a battle with cancer, and he will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| be greatly missed. Okay, so a couple things about COVID-19. First, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| say a huge thank you to all our police, fire, and all our first responders. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| are on the front lines every day, and as a small token of our appreciation, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| have the pedestrian bridge by the Convention Center lit up in red, white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| and blue to honor all of your sacrifices. So that started about a week ago and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| going to just stay lit up red, white, and blue until this pandemic subsides, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| plan, and hopefully that'll be sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Speaking of the pandemic, it changes every day. We at the City, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| working with our community partners and doing everything we can to protect our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| families and our employees to slow down the spread. Just in the past week and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| half, as you know, Governor Lee issued a safer at home order, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| was glad to see. He was in Knoxville last Friday, and I got to meet with him, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| the main message was that we should be preparing for a surge and that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| support, our preparations, but we're sort of responsible at the local level for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| coordinating that response. So the very next day, we convened a surge task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| and that is being led by Dr. Keith Gray. He's with UT Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| Center, but he's been nominated and appointed by all of the area hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| to serve as their representative because hospital capacity and response and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| support is a big part of dealing with the surge. Also, of course, our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| with the Knox County Health Department are on the task force. Colin Ickes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| KEMA, David Brace and Stephanie Welch from the City, and some people from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| Knox County are on there too. And I'm also really, one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| has been hard to deal with is that all the models are either national models or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| statewide models, and we want to deal with what's on the ground here in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| East Tennessee, Knoxville, Knox County region. So luckily, we have so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| talented people at the University of Tennessee with a lot of experience in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| epidemiology, in making very complex math models of biological systems, and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| go to the Howard Baker Center website, you can see some of their work, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| sometime in the near future, they're going to be publishing a model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| projects the COVID surge here in our immediate area, and that will help us do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| make, you know, better decisions based on what the expected surge is, when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| going to be, how big it's going to be, whether we need to open up an alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| care facility, and how many, you know, all those things. So they're going to factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| in our hospital capacity, our pre-existing sort of health situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| in other words, how vulnerable our population is, all those things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| unique to our region, not the state as a whole, and not the country as a whole. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| I'm looking forward to seeing those, seeing that model. Earlier, my executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| order I did, that was, took effect April 1st, that was to just make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| could incorporate the Knox County Health Department's Safer at Home order, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| that, by issuing that executive order, it allowed our city employees to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| enforcement. So Peter Ahrens and other people have formed an enforcement group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| that works with Ronnie Neese and other people at the Health Department, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| have people with our codes enforcement helping out, and our fire inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| office, and our parks and rec people, and just so you know, the goal of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| is to get people to practice the social distancing and follow the Safer at Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| order. It's not to issue citations, and we have not issued a single citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| So the first order of business is to inform people about the Safer at Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| order, why it's so important, and then, you know, ask them to comply, and usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| that's all it takes, and so far, like I said, we haven't issued a single citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| We are asking people, if you have concerns about the order or are worried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| about someone that is not complying, to call 3-1-1, and we will investigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| and we're also being proactive, and particularly in our parks and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| and trying to make sure that people are following the order, but call 3-1-1. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| it's weekends or evenings, you can email 3-1-1 at 3-1-1office at NashvilleTN.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| Last, testing. Testing is a big deal. Last Friday and Saturday, the Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Department partnered with the city and Kroger to offer drive-through COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| tests. 262 tests were administered, so that was a good thing, and for the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| part, though, people are being told to go to their own personal doctors to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| and get tested, and, you know, that's moving forward in that way. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| think supplies are hard to come by, but I know the Health Department and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| private entities are doing the best they can to test people, particularly people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| who are already showing symptoms. Chip Berry has done a great job with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| coordinating some collections of PPE for our first responders at Chilhowee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| last week. They collected 315 N95 masks, 103 boxes of gloves, 150 boxes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1325)|
| 0:22:14| surgical masks, and 75 containers of wipes, and so going forward, we are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| people to drop off any donations of unused commercial-quality PPE, personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| protective equipment, they can bring to the, through TEMA, at the Armory on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| Sutherland Avenue not far from West High School. So if you still have PPE, unused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| PPE that you can donate, that's the place to take it. Working with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| partners, we have funded and started the creation of a new shelter called the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| Guest House. This is for people experiencing homelessness who've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| tested for COVID-19. The Guest House opened this week and can house up to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| people. As of this morning, there were eight people at the shelter. Of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| seven have COVID-19 tests pending, and one has tested positive. Today, I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| allocated $100,000 in emergency funding to the CAC to support their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| Homeward Bound program to help residents fill acute and immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| resource gaps in order to remain in housing and access shelter. This initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| funding can be supplemented by additional funding from the city as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| continue to navigate the pandemic. So that's people who are on the verge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| of being homeless, to help them stay in whatever their housing situation is. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| I'm really pleased that we could give that money to CAC. As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| on your agenda tonight, I'm also recommending $700,000 in emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| funding for Zoo Knoxville. The zoo garners three-quarters of its operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| revenue from ticket sales and memberships, and it's losing more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| $20,000 a day since the pandemic forced it to close. And we'll talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| more when we get to that agenda item. Dozens of partners are coordinating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| through the EOC, the Emergency Operations Center, to make sure people who need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| can connect with food resources, and we're encouraging everyone to call 2-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| if you need help or you know someone who's hungry. Speaking of which, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| United Way has launched the COVID-19 Community Response Fund to assist, so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| asked Matt Ryerson to attend this meeting tonight. He's the president and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| CEO of the United Way Greater Knoxville. Mr. Ryerson, are you, I see, yeah, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| you are. You're unmuted. If you could just share with the council a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| about what United Way is doing, and then maybe see if council members have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| questions. Absolutely. Can you hear me okay, Mayor Kincannon? Yes. All right, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| you, Mayor Kincannon. Thank you, council members, for the opportunity to give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| quick report for you all. I hope what I have to share today is a bit of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| news in the midst of this crisis. About a week and a half ago, we did launch, as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1491)|

| 0:25:01| mayor has already outlined, the challenges that so many nonprofits are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| confronted with, with a perfect storm of increased needs, increased expenses, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| decreased revenue through either programming fees or fundraising events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| So our effort at the United Way was to try and supplement their current budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| with an injection around the COVID-19 Response Fund, especially for programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| that are directly addressing and helping families, in particular, that are impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| by the COVID-19 crisis. As of tonight, we have in-house $152,302| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| that's been raised. We also have, earlier this week, committed an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| $55,000 for what we think is a grand total of $207,302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| We feel really good about that. We already put out requests for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| from nonprofit partners. The sum total of all those requests was $306,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| We're about two-thirds of the way to that initial need. We actually were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| to allocate $57,500 of those dollars on Monday, so that money will be injected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| right back into the nonprofit community. We typically do a little bit more, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1577)|
| 0:26:24| little bit slower process in our allocations. Traditionally, at the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Way, it's most grantmakers, but we felt a sense of urgency around this crisis, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| wanted to turn that around as quickly as possible, and just want to applaud our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| volunteers and so many of our donors that really injected into that fund and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| got that money flowing. Phase two is actually already on its way, and we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| to inject an additional $50,000 into the community next week, and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| probably see a timeline consistent with that. As we know, this crisis is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| over, and in fact, as the mayor highlighted, we expect a surge, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| want to be able to be responsive not only to the needs today of our nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| partners, but the needs that we anticipate in the future. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| Ryerson. Council members, does anyone have a question for Mr. Ryerson about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| the United Way's role in helping coordinate support for our nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| and just our most vulnerable populations? Yeah, I had a couple of questions. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| This is Amelia. Hi, Matt. How are you? Not bad. How are you tonight? Thanks for being on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| the call, and thanks for all the work that you're doing. One clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| question. You said the first phase of grants were allocated yesterday. Did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| say an amount on that? Yeah, that was $57,500. Did you get that amount? No, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1669)|
| 0:28:01| It broke up just a little bit. I'm sorry. $57,500. We knew we were able to inject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| that immediately just because we had that in-house at the time we announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| it, so that that was where we landed on that number. So, it seems like things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| a little tight because I looked into the application process, and it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| that application closed at the end of March or sometime around the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| March. So, in the second phase that you're talking about, we'll only review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| applications that came in during that first round in March. So, anyone who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| developed a need since that application deadline has passed, I'm assuming doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| have an opportunity to apply to this fund? Well, you're correct. In phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| and phase two, we're trying to address the immediate needs related to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| crisis as they've developed in nonprofits that are directly working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| with and expanding services for families. The committee that oversees that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| already decided in phase three and phase four, which we know at this point we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| have, they will open that back up for nonprofit partners that have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| new needs, and that's one of the reasons we're trying to push this out on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| timeline. We don't want to inject it all immediately because we know that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| will be more needs developing as we move forward. Okay, and so as of today, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| all raised about $200,000. You hope by next week you'll have allocated around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| $100,000 of that, but the need expressed from applicants as of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| towards the end of March is around $300,000, so about a $100,000 gap to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| needs of the requests that you've already received. Correct. Okay, and another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| question. I've often worked with grassroots organizations. We, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| run smaller budgets. We do not have the money to hire professional audits, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| haven't been able to participate in the United Way program, so I'm wondering, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| we leaving out a lot of grassroots groups who are providing these direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| services, or is there a way that your work is also interacting with theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Yeah, that's a great question, Councilmember Parker. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Yeah, we have relieved some of the traditional needs related to United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| partnership, and so it's much broader. We still have an accountability to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| debt to make sure we're being good stewards over those dollars. We don't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| require, for example, an audit. A financial review is enough, and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| approaching and partnering with a grassroots organization, so it's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| different. Half of the organizations are not current United Way partners. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| thank you. Okay, thanks, Ms. Parker. Any other questions for Mr. Ryerson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| Oh, yeah, Ms. Ryder. Yeah, Mr. Ryerson, if there's any information, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| don't recall in this conversation if you've shared how people can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| contributions for those who still want to donate. Could we review that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| everyone, and we could also share that with our networks, please? Yeah, yeah, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| you for bringing that up. That's key, right? So the easiest way is just to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| to our website, uwgk.org, uwgk.org, and there's a pop-up link that just goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| directly to the COVID-19 Response Fund. Anybody in the community can give. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| really pleased. Our local networks, the local television stations, have done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| joint PSA, and they'll be running those this week. I believe they started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| tonight, and so they'll be pushing people towards that as well. So we appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| that. Obviously, as a council member had brought up, we are not to our goal, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| we're not to what we anticipate the need will be, so we continue to actively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| pursue both individual and corporate donors to this fund to really support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| the nonprofit community during this time. So again, thank you for bringing that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| Council Member Ryder. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1961)|
| 0:32:49| question, Matt. This is Tommy Smith. For social services, food, shelter-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| questions, most folks should still call 211. Is that the right point of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| for those needs, those individual needs? Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| well. You guys should go to work for me. You're doing a great job. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| absolutely. Anybody that is in the community tonight and finds themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| in a challenge or anticipating a challenge, whether it's rent, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| food, whatever their social situation is, 211 is the best resource. Russ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| Jensen and his team over at 211 are actively pursuing the most up-to-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| information. We are actively working with the EOC and the four social service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| branches, the homeless branch, the food instability branch, senior services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| and youth services, and we are pushing all of those nonprofit partners to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| keep 211 abreast of every expansion, change, closure. So, 211 is the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| resource for anybody looking for help. Thank you. Okay, any other questions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2034)|
| 0:34:03| Mr. Ryerson? Thank you so much for all you're doing for our community, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| thanks for participating in this meeting tonight. Just to summarize, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| you have an individual concern about food or rent, call 211. If you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| donate to United Way, which is helping a lot of organizations help those meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| those needs, go to www.uwgk.org and you can donate online, and the money will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2062)|
| 0:34:30| put to good use. If you have a question about enforcement or the Safer at Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| Order, call 311. And most importantly, if you are worried about your neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| check in on them. Give them a call. There are a lot of vulnerable people, seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| and other people that need your help, so there are organizations that can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| that, but neighbors helping neighbors can also do that too. So, just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| commend everybody for stepping up and doing what we can to help each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| through this crisis. We will get through this, and I'm pleased that the city's, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| know, being a good partner in all this and working together with great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| organizations like the United Way. So, that concludes my report. Are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| reports of council members? Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| You have to unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| Okay, thank you. At our last meeting two weeks ago, there was discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| asking about SBA loans to be forgiven, about us doing a resolution to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| effect. I met with, talked to our attorney, Rob Frost, but as many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| know, since that time, the SBA guidelines have come out. Paycheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Protection Loan is two and a half months' worth of payroll, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| forgiven if you keep people on the payroll through the end of June, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| was one of the big concerns small businesses had. How can I get money if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| I'm going to have to pay it back? So, we did not. I did not bring forward a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| resolution because our concerns have been met. The other thing I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| encourage people is that applications are still being taken. Talk to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| bank. Please apply. There's one round of funding. I suspect there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| another round of funding from the federal government. And also, it is my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| understanding that we all qualify for the emergency declaration disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| loans from SBA, which is a different type of loan. It does have to be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| back, but it has a 30-year amortization. So, the payment will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| catastrophic to someone, and it's deferred for a year. So, anybody who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| concerned, please reach out. If you want the disaster recovery loan, you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| straight to the SBA website. If you want the Paycheck Protection Loan, you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| to a bank. That is all, Mayor. Thank you, Ms. Fugate. Mr. Thomas, did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| have a report? Yes, just briefly, and I simply wanted to clarify during these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| times the best way to get in touch with me as we're not being able to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| meetings, public meetings as we normally do. And it's simply just go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| the City Council website, use that telephone number, use that email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| address. I know some people are trying to maybe contact me through social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| media or by posting things, and it's quite tenuous that I would even see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| post. So, if you really want to get in touch with me, just simply give me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| call, email me. I've got a fairly systematic way of responding. If I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| get back with you immediately, I will get back with you. If for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| you don't hear from me in a while, simply try me again. But I really try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| stay in contact with my constituents, and I don't intend to lower the bar during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| these times. So, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Any other reports from Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| members? I have one. Ms. Parker. I wanted to thank the Mayor and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2289)|
| 0:38:19| administration for developing the response to the resolution passed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| City Council asking that the City evaluate our ability and the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| emergency funding for certain services, and also for any sort of relief we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| provide our residents when it comes to city fees, taxes, etc. And so, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| wanted to use this moment to discuss it briefly, because that's how we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| things on the agenda, right? Is to discuss it during these moments, and also to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| how this will be available for the public. Is this a part of our packet now, or... I mean, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2340)|
| 0:39:09| memo that was sent to you by email earlier today? Yeah. We could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| post it on the City website or something, if you'd like. I don't, you know, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| open to sharing that. You guys can send it out via email to people that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| emails to. It's sort of long, I mean, but that's because we're doing a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| things, and we were answering a lot of questions. So, first, thanks to Erin Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| for working on assembling all those answers, and also to, obviously, lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| members of the City staff for doing those responses we've done to date. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| been a very busy but productive time, and a lot of people working together to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| that happen. So, you have the email, you have the document, feel free to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| that. We could post it to the City website or post it on City social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| as well. You know, a dense document like that is not so conducive to social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| but, you know, if someone really wants to read it, they could read it that way. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| You know, I was just wondering if I referenced it at a later point, if folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| would be able to find it. But I just, you know, one issue that I wanted to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| is our support for individuals experiencing homelessness, and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| to see if there was any additional plans being developed, because I had a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| of concerns. You know, one is, and also since, you know, the City's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2437)|
| 0:40:46| receiving updates from the County, perhaps there's an update from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| County that can be shared during this time, too. But, you know, I'm happy to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| this effort that has moved forward, opening the guest house for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| experiencing symptoms or testing positive. I do want to clarify that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| are separating those populations in that space, and we're hopefully able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| isolate those who have tested positive. That's good. And then also, you know, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2473)|
| 0:41:21| need for, you know, additional shelter, additional individual shelter. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| there have been discussion, and maybe that was just for those experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| symptoms within the County of using some hotel rooms for homeless sheltering in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2493)|
| 0:41:43| place. Are those conversations continuing? My understanding is that, well, I'm gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| let Stephanie Welch address this. She's probably more up to speed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| Stephanie, could you speak to this, please? Can you all hear me? Okay, great. So, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| County does have a protocol already in place for housing individuals who don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| have shelter in hotel rooms when they need to be quarantined. However, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| protocol is really much more relevant in a scenario where there are, like, one or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| two people, let's say it's tuberculosis, or I think in the past they've housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| people who have syphilis in quarantine. This is an unprecedented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| scenario that we're facing, and so the county had 20 hotel rooms, I believe, set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2555)|
| 0:42:43| up and quickly realized that folks would just, there was no social service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| support available through that situation, and came to the city and asked us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| help. We've been partnering directly with the county. We're in conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| the Health Department every day. They've helped to identify medical support. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Metro Drug Coalition has also been coordinating with the county to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| sure that we're providing addiction support through the shelter, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| right now the scenario that we're in is if we've started conversations with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| county about the potential need to expand for quarantine, both for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| who are tested and waiting for results, and for those who test positive. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| more than 18 beds of capacity, and I can let Bruce Spangler address this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2616)|
| 0:43:44| we've already started the conversations with the county about how to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| partnering with them if and when we need to expand to have additional beds. Hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| is right now not the right answer based on the needs of the population that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| we're serving. Does that help? It does. I was just curious if Bruce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2641)|
| 0:44:13| wanted to speak to, you know, what is that solution if it's not the hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| rooms? Councilmember Parker, I'd be glad to, and Mayor. What we have found is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2658)|
| 0:44:31| with the guest house that there needs to be a level of social support because in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| the hotels there's not that level of services as well as engagement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| folks. So at the guest house, we have two people who are on staff 24-7. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| have security. We also have found that the vast majority of our guests are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| struggling with addiction disorders and or co-occurring. So for everybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| comes in, we're doing the substance abuse assessments to see the best way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| can help them, not only just right now but also in the future. As you know, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| folks who are experiencing homelessness have a variety of needs, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| the guest house has just become one point, especially for folks who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| substance abuse because a lot of folks with that disorder, it's difficult for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| them to have stayed in the hotel without the personnel to kind of help direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| and also to help supplement some of their needs. But you had raised the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| question earlier about we do segregate folks who have tested positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| versus those who have test negative. In terms of the volume, you know, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| course, we've only been open for the past two days. Yesterday, we had nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| admissions. At the end of the day, we still had eight guests. Today, we only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| had three admissions with seven people who were discharged with negative test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| results. So at the end of the day, at 5 p.m., we had four guests with us. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| it's kind of hard to tell about the numbers. I hope that helps. That does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| help. And let me ask you this, Bruce. Yes, ma'am. Also in the report, there was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| update that KPD is not going to break up the homeless camps. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2780)|
| 0:46:29| Does your team have capacity to now service and check on those camps and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2789)|
| 0:46:38| help them make sure they have the supplies they need? Yes, our street outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| workers are doing that. Also, CAC has two workers as well. We don't go to camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| that often. We've done a lot of work under the safe space. But I do know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| for the campers, there has just been a lot of information to give them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| remind them about social distancing anywhere from 6 to 12 feet. But we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| trying to get the information out to them. Yes, ma'am. So information, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| necessarily food delivery and that type of stuff. Those connections are made. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| could not tell you with great detail how they are. A lot of them are still coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| to the mission to eat, I'm sure. So a lot of folks will actually sleep at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| camp and then venture out during the day. Ms. Parker, so you brought up an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| important thing that I think we're trying to get the message out. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| a lot of people who want to help neighbors who are homeless, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| now, maybe more than ever. And sometimes they bring food down to the safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| or to the parking lots nearby. And that actually poses a threat to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| people who are homeless because the people who are bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| that food are at higher risk of having coronavirus and bringing it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| people they're trying to help. So we're asking people to bring donations like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| that to other providers to distribute or to food pantries or that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| So there's no shortage of need for food that also serves our homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| neighbors. And the direct contact like that is exactly what we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| minimize. So we're really encouraging generous people and organizations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| give through BMC, CARM, Salvation Army, or other entities that provide food and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| meals to homeless people rather than direct delivery like that. So just a side note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| It's a really important point that you brought up because I think some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| concern that I've heard in the community is that these organizations and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| exist because they've been filling a need that wasn't being met by these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| other agencies. And so that need has only grown during this pandemic. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| concerned that we're, you know, leaving out parts of the population, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| folks who, you know, have been banned from certain areas or whoever it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| and they're not getting the support that they need during this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| because they, you know, they don't get services from the major agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| Well, Ms. Parker, I mean that's a really big challenging question and I think, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| know, we are probably not going to solve homelessness in the in the midst of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| pandemic. I do obviously support the housing first approach and I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| pandemic and our response to it underscores the need to do that. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| know, you know, Mr. Spangler and others are working very hard on that and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| need to keep working on it and more permanent supportive housing and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| affordable housing of other kinds, too. So, but, you know, I don't think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| gonna be able to end homelessness. Well, you know, these schemes are not to try to end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| homelessness in this moment. That would take many, many more resources than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I've proposed, but there are lots of guidelines out there. I shared these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| protocols, you know, with the city a month ago now when it comes to how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| help prevent spread among our unsheltered population. One of those is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| to have readily available hand-washing stations and that was another concern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| mine that we only have this one area that we're telling folks that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| wash their hands during this pandemic located downtown and when we have folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| you know, it makes sense that they would start gathering there and then start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| camping there and that is one encampment that I was told was broken up last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| Friday. And so there, you know, we got to get our policies kind of in order. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| we're pushing everyone, all of this vulnerable population to this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| central point, it makes sense that they would want to, you know, camp there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| because that's where they're feeling safe. If folks, if we want to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| folks to spread out and practice social distancing, then we have to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| that they have the resources where they are and that they don't have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| into downtown just to wash their hands at a public facility. Those are some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| the concerns. Not trying to solve homelessness, but just trying to put some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| things in place that enable all of our residents, you know, to move through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3101)|
| 0:51:50| and face this pandemic with a sense of dignity, you know, and shutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| down our public restrooms, it's going to make it difficult for a lot of folks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| our city. And, you know, our need to kind of keep a positive, upbeat conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| about what's happening. I kind of understand it, but I would rather us have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| that really difficult conversation of how lacking, you know, in resources we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| are right now, but how hard we are working to meet the needs that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| And that's what's concerning me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Well, I share your concern. We are looking for more resources to help our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| homeless neighbors, as well as our first responders, as well as our people in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| medical field. You know, there's a scramble for resources and a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| different needs for our seniors, for our kids, for food, you know, and homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| people are among the most vulnerable. And we are working to address our needs as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| best we can. And it's an ongoing process. And these are good reminders that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| keep working on those things. I mean, that's all I can say at this point. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| mean, I agree with you, but we're doing the best we can to help with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| resources with a lot of vulnerable populations. So do you have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| questions? Or actually, this is, you know, reports. You have any other reports? Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Well, I'll wrap up my section so others can can comment. I just I encourage the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| city to to value the role that our grassroots organizations are playing at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| the moment and and play every day in the city and reaching out to those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| aren't reached by these major service organizations and let's find a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| give them the support and funding that they need. One way that I've seen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| happen is 202 funds that the city council manages. If we had access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| more of those funds, we might be able to move some of the funding to some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| those agencies that are providing that direct outreach and support who've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| already built relationships in the homeless community and can make sure on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| regular basis that folks are getting the services that they need. And I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| encourage us to review, you know, our policies around access to hand-washing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| facilities and whether this one place is enough. But I'll conclude there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3268)|
| 0:54:37| Okay, thanks. Any other comments? Ms. Ryder? Yeah, I have a question if Mr. Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| is still or Dr. Spangler is still with us. I know I've contacted and talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| some of your staff that they're going out and communicating with folks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| camps and letting them know what is going on, making them aware. And so this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| is kind of a two-part, maybe service providers but also the city. Are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| posting signage in areas like the area under the bridge just to kind of make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| folks aware of what's going on? Yes, ma'am, absolutely. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| So there's like permanent messaging versus just verbal. Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3319)|
| 0:55:29| Thank you, Ms. Ryder. Any other? Yeah, Ms. Singh? Yeah, I just wanted to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| comment about the United Way funds. If a small grassroots organization wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| to apply for funds through them, they just need to get a fiscal agent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Community Shares is willing to work with most anybody. And then they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| apply for funds. All right. And the financial review. You don't have to have an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| but I believe you have to have the financial review. And so you have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| time to hire someone, have that review done, submit it by the next deadline. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| Good. Any other reports from council members? Seeing none, let's move on to item 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| Mayor. Oh, sorry, Vice Mayor. No, no worries. Thank you. I also wanted to add on to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| Council Member Parker brought up because the CDC actually does have preventive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| measures guidelines for homeless and for encampments. And so I would like for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| I know there's an emergency response team that we have. We have another team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| that's looking into homelessness. So I do share concerns about them not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| adequate abilities to be able to sanitize their hands, wash their hands. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| don't know if there are any groups that are providing any type of masks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| folks that are out there that as relates to social distancing and, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| now that the new guidelines say that it can could actually be spread through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| just talking to each other. So encampments of 10 or more people, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| like for us to maybe have a follow up communication or some type of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| back from that group. Even if it's just maybe we need to pull together a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| just to talk a little bit more about this particular, the encampment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| homeless people this week, because I definitely share the concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| their ability for sanitation at this point. I know Mike Gunthorne is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| participating in that task force and I'll ask him to bring that up and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| what what kind of solutions they propose as a group. Okay, thank you. In addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| I also want to just remind anyone that's listening that the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Department of Human Services does have emergency TANF cash assistance funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| available for families that qualify for that. You can go to their website or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| can call 866-311-4287 to apply or ask questions to see if you qualify for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| emergency cash assistance. I do know that one of the requirements is that you must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| have children that live in your home. Also, I do want to thank the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Health Department along with Kroger Health. I know Mary, you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| mentioned this, for hosting the drive-through coronavirus testing last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| Friday and Saturday and also Zoonotsville for helping with the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| there, which made it very convenient for people to be able to drive through and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| not have to get out of their cars. I also want to encourage everyone to please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| call and check on seniors, call and check on folks that you know struggle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| maybe mental health issues or substance abuse issues that are recovering. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| may not have access to get to AA or NA meetings, so please just continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| check in on people. Also, just want to share the National Suicide Lifeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| number with anyone that may be listening, so you have it available if you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| access them or know someone you need to share this number with. It is 800-273-8255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3549)|
| 0:59:19| I want to encourage everyone to please take care of themselves on these really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| pretty days. I encourage you to get out, enjoy the sunshine. Social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| does not mean social isolation. We can still call, we can still communicate via| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| texting and Facebook and Instagram, Twitter, all of those social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| outlets. And lastly, I still want to keep the Census 2020 on the forefront of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| everyone's minds to please participate and complete the census. You can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| online if you have not already turned in your census form. And that's it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Ms. Singh? Thank you. I wanted to bring up an issue a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| few different people have called me about the essential workers that are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| there. A lot of employers are not giving them what they need, a mask, a safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| to work in, so that's a big concern. The other one is the social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| gatherings. I went by a party of 75-100 people this weekend just hanging out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| Yeah. And 3-1-1 is what I contacted and eventually, I think now the message has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| changed so that people know how to get in touch with them on the weekend. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| yeah, I contacted them and I think they sent out a Parks and Rec person to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| to them. But I'm really concerned about the employers. Some of them are pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| large companies that are just refusing to give the employees what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| Yeah, that's a big challenge and we do have some enforcement plans in place for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| like the large gatherings and stuff, but you know, dealing directly with employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| is not something that we can directly address. I think, you know, people can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| through TOCHA and that sort of thing, but I mean, that's not going to get immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| responses. So I'm not sure we can try to lead by example as an employer and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| can try to encourage people. Now that the CDC has issued better guidelines on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| you know, that might help, but you know, we need to, as a community, work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3684)|
| 1:01:33| that and try to set a good example and then also get the message out like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| you're doing right now and saying, you know, please take health first and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| foremost in mind because also a lot of the employers are rightfully concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| about the economic impact, but all the research I've shown is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| more you follow like the safer at home orders, the faster your economy bounces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| back afterwards because people are healthier and the pandemic restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| subside sooner. So, but it's, you know, that's hard to convince people when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| they are thinking about bills and whatnot that the very next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| not six months down the road. But yeah, it's really difficult to enforce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| the city really doesn't have any enforcement authority to call up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| employers and say you must provide masks. You know, it's not the law. It's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| law in the city. It's not a law of the state or federal government. So it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| what's advised and, you know, I'm not sure what kind of, what kind of things we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| do except urging people. Go ahead. Sorry. I know that in some executive orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| they include what the rules are about spacing and what the needs are. And maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| if it's in an executive order, then maybe the health department would be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| go out there and at least say this is what you need to be doing. Well, here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| the thing is the health department, we adopted their thing because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| are the ones who have, you know, the most direct authority over pandemics. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| that's why when I did the executive order for the city, I adopted their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| order word for word so we'd be on the same page. And they are enforcing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| obviously, throughout the, you know, they're enforcing the stuff in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| restaurants and food in particular. But if we, I could pass orders left and right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| and the health department's not going to enforce them. Like they're not city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| you know, they're not an agency of the city. They serve us. They are our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| health department, but they won't be responsive to executive orders that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| aren't consistent with their own, their own authority. Uh, Mr. You get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3819)|
| 1:03:46| Thank you, Mayor. I was just gonna say I will. Um, I will say it may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| that an employer does not want to get stuff for somebody. Everybody is having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| a hard time. There isn't sanitizer hand sanitizer to get. We've got it on back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| order. My office is closed and I'm trying to buy it for when we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| come back and we can't get it. So I want people to understand. It may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| that somebody doesn't want to. They just may not be able to purchase them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3850)|
| 1:04:15| because they're competing with hospitals and major employers, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| if you're a small employer. It's really hard. You don't have the purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| power of a large company. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| That's that's a good point. Sometimes, um, you know, everybody's looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| masks. Everybody's looking for, um, financial resources to get by. Whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| you're an individual or a business, it's just a hard time. Um, but we can if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| you have suggestions and and also like, you know, keep trying to get the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| out about the 311. That's not gonna be an immediate response. Um, but, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| know, it's we're doing the best we can to, uh, stop those large gatherings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| particular. Um, it's easiest when they're at a parks, you know, in a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| facility or public land. But, um, even when people see that happening and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| private entity, they can call it in and we can try to send someone over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| Say, Look, this is not safe. Please stop gathering like this. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| and you I don't know what the nature of that gathering was missing. But, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| you know, it's people in their twenties are the largest group of, um, people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| are who are getting diagnosed with Covid 19. So they're not immune. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| are getting this disease in greater numbers than any other age group. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| hope that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| understand that and try to change their behavior and comply with the safer at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3944)|

| 1:05:50| members or committees. Um, so let's move on to, um, elections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=3950)|

| 1:11:17| to create a hardened infrastructure for the safety and security of local waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| Move to approve. Motion made by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Ms. Testerman. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4283)|
| 1:11:33| Just a question. Aren't waterways not under the jurisdiction of the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| Is Chief Sharp or Chief Thomas available to answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4300)|
| 1:11:54| I mean, I don't think they're going to be fighting fires if there's a one call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| Ms. Ryder, do you know the answer? Reviewing the agenda item documentation that came via| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| our email, it says that this is to fight fires on the shoreline, so like buildings and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| things on our shorelines. It gives them a different vantage point with this equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| This is David Brace and Steve King could also probably opine a bit on this about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| the actual water itself, but we have to access properties that we have control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| from the water. And so when you look at the development along our waterways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| we have to still provide fire and law enforcement and rescue for those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| and oftentimes we access it through the river. Okay, Chief Sharp, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4359)|
| 1:12:51| Yes, David is exactly correct on that. This is for us to get a new fireboat. We have a fireboat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| but it is not really designed to meet the needs that we have on the waterfront now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| So this does give us the ability to fight fire from the water itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| If I could just add as well, this would be over a three-year period, and we have bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4390)|
| 1:13:19| water treatment plant, gas storage, UT Stadium, the Ball Navy. We have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| waterfront development that we're not able to provide safety and fire protection for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you. Thank you, Chief Thomas. Thank you, Chief Sharp. Any further questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| this resolution? Okay, seeing none, Mr. Johnson, would you conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| Vice Mayor McKenzie? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4422)|

| 1:14:51| Get another computer out here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Ma'am, 11D was a Certificate of Compliance. That was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| Oh, that was, okay, so we are on 12. Sorry, I'm the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| Okay, so yeah, Lisa New, Ms. New, could you unmute yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| Yes, this is Lisa New. I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Okay, Ms. Singh, go ahead. You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you for being here, Lisa. Yes, when I first heard about the sum that was being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| it was so large, it really blew me away, and I did need to come out and visit you at the Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4522)|
| 1:15:29| and I appreciate all the questions you answered, but some of my concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4529)|
| 1:15:36| it's seeming like such a big amount when we have so much need at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| Can you explain what the alternatives are to funding the Zoo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| And how did we get to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| Ms. New?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Yes, sure, thank you, and everyone can hear me, I think, so, well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| I appreciate the opportunity to be able to answer your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| and I do recognize that it is a large sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| We have presented a plan that is a three-month plan anticipating closure potentially through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| end of June, so when Zoo Knoxville closed on March 16th, that was the first day of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4577)|
| 1:16:25| County Spring Break, that is when typically our revenues start to come in, and we become cash flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4585)|
| 1:16:34| positive again, so the closure caused us to lose revenues of about $20,000 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4594)|
| 1:16:43| And we did close, and we made drastic reductions, but the animals are still there, 700 animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4603)|
| 1:16:52| we have reduced our personnel by 40%, we have cut our overhead substantially as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| but Councilwoman Singh, you walk through the Zoo, you know it's a large park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| it's a 54-acre park, 700 animals, and it is operated under contract with the city, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4625)|
| 1:17:14| we do need the city's emergency relief, even though we've closed, we still are incurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| expenses every day to maintain the park, and primarily to take care of our animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| Okay, and then you also have a rainy day fund of sorts, can you talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| We have, at the time of our closure, we had an operating reserve of about $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4654)|
| 1:17:44| When we say that the timing happened at the very worst time of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| that is a very accurate statement, so that reserve is our balance in our operating line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4668)|
| 1:17:57| We have a $1.5 million operating line of credit, and we draw on that to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| our expenses in January and February when it's cold and people aren't coming to the Zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| and then we begin to pay that down. So, if the closure, for instance, had happened in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4690)|
| 1:18:18| or August, you would have found our reserve at $1.5 million instead of where it was. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| it's a moving target based on what's happening at the Zoo. So, we had a small reserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| but again, our cash burn rate, even with our reductions, is about $189,000 a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4711)|
| 1:18:40| so you can do the math to see why that is an urgent crisis for us without any revenue coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| in. 75% of our revenues come from our gate admissions and from birthday parties and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| picnics and all of those things that people enjoy with the Zoo. We do not have those revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| coming in, yet we still are incurring our expense. Right. It's about $200,000 a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4741)|
| 1:19:09| you were saying. A lot of that goes towards paying the employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| It's true. About 52% of our expenses are for our personnel, and to put that in perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4754)|
| 1:19:25| I mentioned we had had a 40% reduction in personnel cost, but of my staff, I have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4765)|
| 1:19:32| 50 animal keepers, 50 keepers that care for those 700 animals. Their pay has also been reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4772)|
| 1:19:42| despite the fact that I still need them to work 40 hours a week. All of us took substantial pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| cuts, but the keepers are still there and doing the work to care for the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4789)|
| 1:19:57| And then you're going to be applying for funds with the state and federally as well for payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| right? Yeah, so since I presented to Mayor Kincannon, a few things have happened that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4805)|
| 1:20:12| were not certain at the time of the request. We had anticipated, and in fact it did occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4812)|
| 1:20:19| that we got a $500,000 loan. So let me back up to say that my three-month plan to operate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4819)|
| 1:20:27| enclosure at a bare bones level is about $2.1 million. So it's a big number for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4827)|
| 1:20:36| So we're trying to cobble together funding any way we can, and we have not ceased to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| since we made our request. So we got the $500,000 loan from the county, which was much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4843)|
| 1:20:53| We have an emergency relief fund that we sent out to our public, and to date that has raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| $162,000, and that comes from 1,360 donors. So again, our donors have almost paid for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4860)|
| 1:21:11| of our operations. We have applied for the PPP, the Payroll Protection Plan. If we are awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| that, we are awaiting notification, but we did file our application on Monday. We tried on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4879)|
| 1:21:26| but we couldn't get in. That should award about $1.1 million. And then we've also applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| the SBA program, the loan program, but that is a collateralized loan, and all of our collateral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4896)|
| 1:21:44| is tied up in the city's assets. The buildings belong to the city, so we're not sure what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4904)|
| 1:21:52| award for that would be. Oh, and the one I didn't mention is we do have a relief funding request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4912)|
| 1:22:00| from Senator Massey and the entire Knoxville delegation, a request into Governor Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| but we've yet to have a response on that. The reason I was asking about the funds that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| will be getting is we had talked yesterday about if it was possible for us to, for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4933)|
| 1:22:20| to do this as a loan with the same type of loose terms as what the county gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4940)|
| 1:22:28| Yes, and my response to that is that, you know, we are in a very desperate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4948)|
| 1:22:37| We are grateful for whatever the city is able to do, but the county is a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| We have an operating line of credit, but that is a high interest loan, and none of those replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| the revenues that we are losing every day. So it just kicks our can down the road, so to speak. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4971)|
| 1:22:58| makes us more vulnerable when we open. We have not replaced those revenues. We are just incurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| debt that we have to pay back over time. Some of you privately have asked me how we would avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| this happening again, and we certainly were well on our way. A five-year plan to have a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| dollars in reserve in addition to our line of credit. We were three years in and had met our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=4999)|
| 1:23:27| goal of $200,000 saved a year, but if we receive nothing but loans, that just makes us extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5007)|
| 1:23:36| vulnerable further down the line. But the payroll loans are forgivable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5016)|
| 1:23:47| The payroll loans are forgivable if you restore pay back to the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5027)|
| 1:23:55| levels up to $100,000, I believe, and that's for an eight-week period. So it would not cover us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5035)|
| 1:24:04| indefinitely, but we would certainly hope that should we get that, that would provide an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5044)|
| 1:24:11| for us to reduce the debt we already have. The 1.1 million dollars on the line of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| and free up some liquidity should this event go on further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| Okay. It is a huge operation. I was really surprised to be there yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| 700 animals, $700,000, $1,000 an animal just to feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5069)|
| 1:24:39| So I forgot the last question I had. That's it. I'll think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5079)|
| 1:24:48| Ms. Testerman, and then Mr. Smith after that. So thank you, Ms. New, for giving us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5088)|
| 1:24:57| information. I appreciate the time that you've spent with me on the phone really painting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| full picture of that. You know, I think, you know, obviously in going through all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| it is a substantial amount of money. There are a lot of question marks out there when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| the SBA loan. Also with the budget that the city has yet to, you know, put together and pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5116)|
| 1:25:27| obviously with the hope that, you know, as well that the city's allocation comes in July. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| looking into the end of June and then this potentially the city's allocation of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| they've been doing, the $1.45 million and whatever that looks like moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| You know, I think again, I think it would be helpful and would be interested on the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| of council's feedback. If, you know, if council passes this tonight, the distribution is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| three months, correct? So it's April, May and June, $200,000 each. And so I think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5162)|
| 1:26:09| be really helpful if you would be able to come back before each of those distributions to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| council an update on, you know, where you are, how, you know, have those loans been realized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5176)|
| 1:26:25| You know, what's the status? And again, looking because we're dealing with so many unknowns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| you know, what is your team? What is the board come up with a long-term or longer term strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5191)|
| 1:26:38| on, you know, how things are starting to shape up and have there been any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| creative solutions or problem solving that you all are thinking about for longer term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5205)|
| 1:26:52| Should this pandemic last longer than any of us certainly hope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| Ms. Snow, did you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Sure, I will be happy to. Well, I wanted to first say I would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| if council would like to hear from me before that distribution every month, I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| happy to give updates. I'll also say that, you know, since we have a new appointment on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| board and Stephanie Welsh, Gwen McKenzie is our city council appointment on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5239)|
| 1:27:27| But when Jen, I'm sorry, Stephanie replaced Jim York. And so her first board meeting hit right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5247)|
| 1:27:36| when the pandemic began. And so she's not yet been on the board. The reason I say that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5256)|
| 1:27:44| again, I'm happy to come to council every month, but the city has representation on our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| Stephanie's first board meeting will be April 15th. Stephanie and I have set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| check-ins on April 10th of every month before any disbursement would go to the zoo. Essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| doing just as you said, Janet, reporting on that. So again, I would be happy to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5285)|
| 1:28:14| to give any kind of input updates, but I do know that vice mayor McKenzie and Stephanie Welsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5294)|
| 1:28:22| are going to be part of that strategic planning, looking at the zoo's future moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| Yeah. I just thought it might be helpful too, for constituents, I think, as they see this from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| a public perspective, you know, again, knowing that there are large dollars that there are a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| of people that are struggling and trying to look at their futures financially, that it might just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| be helpful from a public perspective, you know, for you to be able to kind of share that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| but you all, you know, you do a great job, you know, obviously understand animal welfare and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| it's a lot of work. So, you know, and I know it's hard in the nonprofit world is hard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5339)|
| 1:29:09| Thank you, Mr. Esterman, Mr. Smith. And then, yeah, just one quick question. Was there a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| amount tied to this, the grant request from the state of emergency request from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| Yes, essentially, we ask for a gap to fill, assuming that or hoping that there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5361)|
| 1:29:30| would come through from the city. And we had already accounted for what happened with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| county. So the request to the state is for $868,000. That number would essentially allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| to pay down our line of credit, be able to fund the zoo at the bare bones level for the next three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| months, and then preserve that line of credit liquidity as we move into the rest of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Smith, Ms. Bugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Thank you. I just wanted to say I plan to support this. The zoo is a tremendous asset for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5404)|
| 1:30:13| and it is through no fault of the zoos that they find themselves in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| They're like everybody else. They're trying to cobble together to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| their business model going. The line of credit does have to be paid off. It has to rest for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| days. I feel Ms. New's pain greatly. This is our cookie season. Same thing happens when you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| your cash in March and a pandemic stops your revenue from coming. It's not your fault. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5439)|
| 1:30:47| I'm fine with us asking for reports, but I fully intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5447)|
| 1:30:56| Thank you, Ms. Bugan. Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| Thank you. My comments are more about process than questions for the Knoxville Zoo because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5460)|
| 1:31:11| I obviously love the Knoxville Zoo and have been going there all my life and have all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| lovely pictures of riding elephants at the Knoxville Zoo that I'm fond of and I want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| you know, future generations to have those experiences as well. So I do not want to see us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| lose our zoo in Knoxville. My concern is that we are not getting a full picture of the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5490)|
| 1:31:44| and that full picture is really something that the administration is privy to and it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5504)|
| 1:31:53| under our state of emergency, the administration has the full authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| to make emergency funding allocations. If there is anything that threatens the physical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5519)|
| 1:32:10| economic health of our community, I imagine that that is within the powers of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| And so I was a little concerned with our agenda item that we were being asked whether to allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5538)|
| 1:32:26| this as a part of next year's budget in addition to next year's budget. And, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5546)|
| 1:32:36| difficult for us to be able to make that decision of what we as a city have the capacity to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5556)|
| 1:32:47| because we don't have that overview. And so my recommendation would be for this to be a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5567)|
| 1:32:58| that is left with the mayor so that we can, as a city council, have a more thorough understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| of what budget is about to come before us in two weeks and make decisions based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| of, you know, thorough presentation of where we're at. Because there was another issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| that was previously on this agenda that I was very interested in talking about, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5598)|
| 1:33:25| testing for our first responders and there was an amount budgeted for that. So I didn't know if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| was spending that was continuing, if that was something that the administration is moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| forward without city council vote. Those are my questions about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| Well, I'll speak to that. The $40,000 for testing for our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| was something we moved forward with and I believe we're able to fund with existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| budgetary monies. And also it was, you know, relatively low dollar amount and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5632)|
| 1:34:00| I just went ahead and did that in part because it's such a crucial thing that our first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| be able to get testing and get it done at the center and that sort of thing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| this is, this proposal is amending this year's budget, not next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| So that's why I was bringing it to you. And I think in general, good practice. I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| I do think I have some authority to spend money in an emergency basis, but I still want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| to the council and get, you know, I went ahead and forwarded a hundred thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5667)|
| 1:34:36| you know, and, and if you guys choose not to support this tonight, I'll still, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| keep that going. And I don't know what, you know, I'll decide about the balance of 600,000, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| I think this is a big important part of our economy and also a big ask. And I didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| to do that unilaterally without seeking the support of council because I understand your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| concerns and I share them about why this came up and it's such a big amount and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| So, but I think it's in general, my hope to seek budget work with the, with, with council on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5706)|
| 1:35:15| particularly big budget items. So that's, that's why I brought it to you and it is for this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| year. Ms. Welch, did you have anything you wanted to add? She's been sort of taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| lead on the zoo stuff. If you wanted to speak to address some of those concerns, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| Um, thank you, mayor. And, um, I just want to make sure I understand what concerns I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| addressing. Um, I, what I can tell you is that I'm, I have gone over our contract with the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| very thoroughly. Um, and I, just as a reminder to council, and I know that this was stated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| Ms. New, but, um, the, the city actually owns the property and all of the assets on the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| We're basically contracting with, with, um, the zoo to the nonprofit to manage those assets. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5762)|
| 1:36:12| I don't know that this has been said directly, but, you know, it's in our best interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| not only for the overall, um, it's a, it's a huge regional attraction. This is a world-class zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5777)|
| 1:36:25| that we have in our community. So there's a, there's a big economic development reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| support the zoo. It's an, it's a local attraction for our residents as well. Um, but really when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| comes down to it, the success of the zoo is important so that the city doesn't get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| into the business of being zoo keepers. So I think that we're, um, you know, the zoo has done a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| job of managing the property. And, um, I think according to our, our contracts, we'll, we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5808)|
| 1:36:57| um, continue to, to work with them to make sure that they're doing the things they need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| to move their finances forward as they have been over the past few years. So, um, I, I welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| anybody's, um, input on, you know, the kind of things that you want Ms. New and I to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| touching base about. If we need to bring this back to council, um, for regular updates, we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5834)|
| 1:37:23| we can look, uh, we can look at that as well. But, you know, I think what makes this a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| bit different from many of the other nonprofits in our community, all of which are doing great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| work, some of whom are represented on city council. Um, we actually own the property that the zoo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| sits on. So it's, it's a different relationship we have with the zoo, with the city. I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| mayor, if that answers your question or if any council members have questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| Just to clarify the memo that came from the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| um, the memo says the, uh, the $700,000 request. If we do not approve the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| a hundred thousand will be deducted from next year's fiscal year 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| next year Zoo Knoxville budget. What about the other 600,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| This is Boyd Evans here, the deputy finance director. That is, that is correct. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5896)|
| 1:38:26| in other words, if you all disapprove that, then I think next year FY21, it's supposed to be 1.45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5906)|
| 1:38:35| million that goes to the zoo. We would just be 1.35 million. We would take the, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| they wouldn't get that additional $100,000. This, uh, the balance, the 600K for a total of seven is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5923)|
| 1:38:52| what you're being asked to approve right now. It would come out of this budget, FY20, the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| budget, uh, not, not the upcoming budget. And, uh, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| decision as to whether you approve it or not. Thank you, Mr. Evans. Why don't we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5943)|
| 1:39:11| we'll come back, Ms. Parker, several other council members want to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| and if you come back to, if you still have more questions. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| I'm sorry, did Councilwoman Singh, uh, want to make a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Yeah, but you hadn't gone yet. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. I'll, I'll close it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| Okay. I was just going to say this. I do see this as a couple of different things. One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| it's, it's a, an investment that the city has made. If we don't continue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| we're going to lose a lot. Uh, it, there are also about 150 jobs there during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5979)|
| 1:39:47| Uh, but really what comes to mind is this feels like a puppy that we bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| when times were good. Now times are hard. We still have to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| Thank you, Ms. Singh. And I just have to say again, my question is that this is beyond a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=5996)|
| 1:40:11| You know, even if we look at CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6013)|
| 1:40:34| having a more comprehensive conversation is what makes most sense and seems most fiscally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| responsible and if we're not able to be able to predict what essentially you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| know the mayor is preparing for us it seems like a decision that should sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| with the mayor and then there will be a lower general fund balance that comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| us in the budget proposal. Council Member Ryder I've muted you I think the birds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| were creating some disturbance. Okay thank you Ms. Parker. Ms. Ryder did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| want to speak? Trying to get a word in edgewise over the birds and everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6071)|
| 1:41:24| else and I forgot what I was even gonna say. I like Councilwoman Singh's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| analogy about this being a cute puppy and now we you know times are hard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| we still got to take care of it but I personally am in not a position to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| home an exotic animal and foster it so I I'm gonna support this. I did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| extensive conversation with Ms. New about things that they were doing to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| back. I'm not gonna elaborate it but you know in terms of things they were adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| to future infrastructure they've cut back on some of the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| and I was good I felt good knowing that they've really exhausted I mean they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| backed against the wall as many families and many people are in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| this is unprecedented we have no idea how long it's going to last and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| devastating for our community I mean nightly it's you fight back tears at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| the things that are happening in our community here just here much less the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| world around us what the things that are happening so we are in a position to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| help them figure it out and I think that there's a lot of discussion going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| right now about how they can have a plan in the future to avoid a situation like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| this in case it were to happen again and I appreciate Ms. New's time and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| appreciate her creative analysis her and the board to try and figure out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| to make things work and piece things together and we talked about how to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| them open and what that's going to look like in the future with potential social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6188)|

| 1:43:21| still a hard pill to swallow it's a lot of money so anyway that's just kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| rambling way of saying I'm supporting it and I'm not thrilled about giving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| and we've got to figure out how to solve all these problems it's a difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| thank you miss writer mr. Thomas and then miss Testerman yes this has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| excellent discussion and I commend council for it it is a lot of money I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| just wanted to make a comment about the educational asset that the Jew that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| zoo is it provides a lot of mainly I'm thinking of underprivileged youth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| wouldn't ordinarily have the opportunity to get this experience I know they do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| lot of things for free in the community the public schools are allowed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| field trips to the zoo and allow kids regardless of their economic situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| to be able to be able to have this experience so in some ways it's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| investment in education and it is a lot of money but overall I think it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| it so I'm going to support it as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| thank you mr. Thomas miss Testerman just wanted to add as well I mean to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| insult to injury in this and their largest fundraiser is generally the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| of June and obviously that that is gonna have to be postponed and or canceled I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| don't know what the what the thought is there you know I don't want to make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| mistake that I'm wholeheartedly you know the zoo is an incredible value to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| community and and we all I think we're all on the same page with that so I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| wanted to iterate that and you know I think the recommendation of just you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6311)|
| 1:45:18| know Lisa knew coming back I think just to kind of hear because I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| all invested in it we know that there there is it's a it is a lot of money so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| I think to be able to keep our finger on the pulse just to see what may but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| might be to miss Welch you know or councilwoman McKenzie being able to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| us frequent updates but I think there's a lot of members of the public to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| are invested in this as well and would like to be you know brought up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| and you know as to you know how things are progressing and moving forward thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| you mr. Smith vice-mayor McKenzie you wanted to be the last one to speak is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| that right that's fine mr. Smith I just say this is a really hard decision it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6360)|
| 1:46:10| a lot of money there are a lot of people suffering but what does make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| decision a little easier is the financial stewardship that you've shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| since taking over the zoo just for a rainy day fund to save $200,000 every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| year shows that you're bracing for some amount of emergency this is extraordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| but I commend you for that and I plan to support it as well but I just that makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| it a little easier knowing that the financial stewardship is sound at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| zoo so thank you for that yes go ahead thank you councilman Smith I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6402)|
| 1:46:52| to say I do appreciate recognizing our goal to raise or save a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| in five years and again we were three years in but the zoo has had substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6419)|
| 1:47:06| growth the past several years 15% revenue growth since 2014 and and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6426)|
| 1:47:14| have used those cash reserves not only to improve our reserve but also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6434)|
| 1:47:23| improve the living wage of our employees so a million dollars over the past three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| years we have put into improving the base wages of our most vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| employees so you have college-educated and very skilled craftsmen who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| starting at $8 an hour and that was three years ago they're now at $10.5 an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| hour it's a slow process but again in terms of how did the zoo get to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| point we have invested in in a reserve in our staff and also in maintaining the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| park so you know capital money and maintenance has gone into the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| of Zoo Knoxville to make it a better place for the community and and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6485)|
| 1:48:12| also managed to you know maintain a 3% margin and in our net income over all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6492)|
| 1:48:19| those years so I appreciate that you know there's there are still limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| resources and we have tried to to tackle several several fronts with the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| growth that we've had so thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie. Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6510)|
| 1:48:44| Okay so a lot of good feedback a lot of good comments and Lisa thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| being on the line to address concerns and answer some of the questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| were asked by council. Zoo Knoxville is one of the city's largest tourist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| attractions that brings in and generates tax dollars into the city. In addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| that it also gives back to our Knox County School students annually by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| allowing them to be able to get free admission into the zoo. The executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| board of Zoo Knoxville understands the urgency and is working their strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6559)|
| 1:49:27| plan a long-term strategic plan as Lisa talked about as it relates to reserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| for the zoo. The zoo has grown leaps and bounds in the last 20 years when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| Councilmember Parker talked about riding the elephant you know I think about Big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| Diamond when I was little that was there at the zoo and so when you think back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| where the zoo was when we were younger fast forward to where it is today and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| some of the projects that are going on there at the zoo. We have a world-class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| zoo here in Knoxville Tennessee one that we definitely can be proud of but one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| that I think that most people would agree that the city we do not want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| in the zoo business. Someone asked well what's the flip side if we don't help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6606)|
| 1:50:11| support the zoo and help keep them going during this crisis and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| potentially that they could bankrupt and we would they would default back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| and in our attempts to be able to keep the zoo going have to do additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6620)|
| 1:50:25| contracts that would potentially cost us a lot more money than what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| taking to operate currently and so I'm pleased and I'm satisfied with what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| heard as it relates to their plans going forward what they're doing to tap into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| funding in addition to what they're requesting from the city to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| keep the zoo operations going it does appear that they are down to bare bones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| as it relates to the operations outside of the animal upkeep at this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| point and just the grounds upkeep at this point. Difficult decision that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| have to make today but aside from the zoo I want to ask my colleagues here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| City Council to please keep an open mind because as this global pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| continues and as it drags on we are going to be faced with even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| difficult decisions as it relates to organizations that would need potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| significant assistance to be able to stay open. I'm very interested in making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6684)|
| 1:51:31| sure that we're focusing on our vulnerable population as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| because as this continues to to move forward those their needs will definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| increase and so I just want us to keep that in mind as we move forward so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| will be in support of course of this of providing the funding to the zoo as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| did make the motion to approve it and appreciate all of your comments all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| your concerns and just ask that we all just kind of keep that in mind these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6717)|
| 1:52:02| these you know this is one of very many probably difficult decisions that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| gonna have to make before this thing is is over and I just want to thank thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6725)|

It allocates a thousand. That's why I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6912)|
| 1:55:33| curious what that thousand was for so that we could have a sense of what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| need is because whatever it is we know a thousand ain't covering it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=6940)|

| 2:02:10| thought I'd direct some questions before we get started to Director Green if he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| present. I'm present. Can you hear me? I can hear you Director Green. With regard to the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7335)|
| 2:02:24| use classification table that we find in the appendix B of the packet I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| it's page 219. Is RN 3 included in low-density residential? I'll answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7349)|
| 2:02:38| question and provide some background information. It is provided it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| included in the low-density residential. That's because I'm looking at the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| map there are several existing attached unit developments that are located within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| areas designated on sector plan or one-year plan as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| These are low-density developments that comply with the low-density standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| or the density standards or they'll date the ARIC land use classification but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| they provide a different type of housing and typical single-family provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| options for housing throughout the community and that was the desire here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| not necessarily to to override the density standards of the low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| residential designation to provide opportunities for a variety of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| types. As a townhouse development in the RN 3 a special-use permit is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| That requires approval by the Planning Commission. One of the standards for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| approval of a special use is compliance with adopted plans and policies so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| low-density residential density designations and requirements would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7422)|
| 2:03:49| with the approval of the variety of housing types in this case a townhome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| development. So in that the low-density that's supposed to be limited to less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7433)|
| 2:04:01| than six units per acre? That's correct but it does not limit the type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7441)|
| 2:04:06| housing and what we're trying to do is again comply putting this in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| low-density residential category allow our opportunities for a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| housing type development within the low-density areas for example steeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| slopes property with steeper slopes could be developed with townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| cluster where the townhome development were not permitted they'd have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| divided into lots. Well it's my understanding that plans review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7468)|
| 2:04:34| inspection issues permits based on district dimensional standards not based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| on the one-year plan or sector plans so if RN 3 is included in low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| low-density residential then it would allow a duplex on a minimum lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| size of 7,500 square feet which would be 10 units an acre when the low-density in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7489)|
| 2:04:55| the plan we just talked about has to be less than six is that correct? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| correct. Possibly it's time to review our land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| use density standards because quite honestly six units per acre is far below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| low-density in an urban setting we need to start accepting the fact that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| an urban community and review those I'm not sure what the answer is for terms in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| terms of the maximum density or low density but is six the correct number in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| an urban setting. Okay so there is some conflict there I guess. Correct and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7526)|
| 2:05:35| of that likely is because our plans the land use classification table has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| been thoroughly updated and the land use classifications have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| reviewed thoroughly for years. Okay well I'm council members as you can see by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| what we just talked about you know and I thank Director Green for answering these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| questions I think we've got some substantive changes that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| here that really require robust discussion with public participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7558)|
| 2:06:04| outside of limitations we have during this zoom meeting you know many of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| neighbors don't have access to technology or the internet without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| access to libraries they might be unable to have their voice heard tonight on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| such a substantive change so I'd like to make a three-part motion actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| to remove these substantive changes from the 2020 one-year plan. Earlier this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| afternoon Mr. Johnson had emailed a copy of the land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| that council passed unanimously back in November of 2019 so I make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| we substitute the land use classification table in our packet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| the land use classification table council passed in November of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| Further I make a motion that on page 12 in the low-density residential section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| under item C we remove RN3. Mr. Roberto I think we should entertain one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7610)|
| 2:06:57| motion at a time. Well I was trying to put them all in one but we can do them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| one at a time that's okay. Well you can tell I mean I think it's just gonna be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| little complicated and maybe and I don't the item that you mentioned we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| don't have that you know the substitute document. It was emailed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7631)|
| 2:07:17| council this afternoon so I can start there I'll make the motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| substitute the November 2019 land use chart or table from the one that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7643)|
| 2:07:30| the packet. I'll second that motion. Motion made by Mr. Roberto seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7650)|
| 2:07:39| Councilwoman Ryder. Ms. Ryder did you want to discuss that or you want to I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7659)|
| 2:07:47| a little fuzzy on what it's what the differences are I understand them the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| original agenda item but I don't you know and I think it's consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| our efforts towards affordable housing as well. It is the addition of the RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7676)|
| 2:08:03| in low-density and so when we go back to the this would remove the substance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| change of adding in RN3 during the zoom meeting basically. What would well Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7689)|
| 2:08:19| Ryder or did someone else have Mr. Thomas yes I guess I'm just looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| some clarification right now I heard councilperson Roberto's discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| possibly the need to postpone this and have more discussion on it and then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7710)|
| 2:08:36| sounds like we're supposed to be voting on parts of it in piecemeal so I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| my question is are we gonna postpone it as a whole and then have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| about it at a later date are we going to have votes on part of it in sections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7728)|
| 2:08:55| then postpone the rest of it I guess I'm just not clear on it. We're required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7735)|
| 2:09:03| we're required to pass the one-year plan councilperson Thomas so we can't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| postpone it what what I'm suggesting is that there's a substantive change here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| and that this may not be the appropriate venue or time to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| substantive change so the the most logical thing to do would be to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| to what we passed in November of 2019 you know if this this change is a is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| good idea it'll be a good idea when we can meet in the city county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| I understand thank you so there's a motion to amend one document for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7774)|
| 2:09:45| and I haven't seen the document I don't you didn't you didn't copy me or anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| from the administration I guess so I can't you know I'm not exactly I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| personally don't understand what you're doing but maybe other people do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| councilwoman Tester in Councilman Roberto and I do understand that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| the RN 3 when they're also the addition of RN 5 are you looking at that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| third as a third there's gonna be a three-part motion so yeah that that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7811)|
| 2:10:17| that'll come up next yes I got a woman fuguet so as I understand this it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7817)|
| 2:10:25| basically we're going to put into the one-year plan what council approved four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| months ago unanimously until such time we can talk about these from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=7831)|

| 2:23:12| about the different options which were available for the property in in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| meeting as I summarized the view the view of the neighbors was that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| would prefer nothing to happen to the property but after consideration they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| would agree to four residential lots the issue came up that to obtain the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8606)|
| 2:23:32| residential lots I needed to rezone the property to the r2 zoning I have met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8612)|
| 2:23:39| with the neighbors before I purchased when I had it under contract before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| purchased it I've kept them completely informed all the way through at every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| opportunity with site plans and the look and feel of what we're doing none of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8628)|
| 2:23:54| that is is obligated as they would say mr. Green would say as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| zoning process but it shows the good-faith effort on my part to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| through the needs and the requirements of the neighbors as the way they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| like to see the property develop the issue has come up that I can I need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| have the r2 zoning to be able to come up with the four lot without any variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| and there's a site planning included in your package that I presented to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8659)|
| 2:24:25| that we have a site plan which does allow for four lots which does allow by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| right for single-family houses and we have also worked to keep the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8669)|
| 2:24:36| involved as to the kind of houses we would build in the look and feel of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| that would be so the issue has gotten to be that they're concerned that the r2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| zoning opens up a density greater than what I'm proposing and they're worried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| about the fact that this is what they've expressed to me they may have other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| concerns but their primary concern has been to me that if I lose control of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| property somehow somebody else to come in and propose something that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8698)|
| 2:25:02| wouldn't like there's two issues there the first is that whatever is done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| this property it has to go back to MPC for approval of the concept plan it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8708)|
| 2:25:14| to be done and then separate in addition to that it has to go back for the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8714)|
| 2:25:19| plat approval the issue of the economics of what is going to happen in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| property this is probably if you were putting a bullseye on the most expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8724)|
| 2:25:31| one-mile circle of real estate in the city of Knoxville this is it the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8731)|
| 2:25:37| of anybody acquiring this property to do anything less than something that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| meet the needs of the people who want to live in that community is remote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| additionally to that as I've stated I can never rule out the possibility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| this is not part of the zoning consideration and I recognize that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| it's a direct answer to the neighbors questions the I see no situation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8756)|
| 2:26:03| even in the middle of the COVID crisis that we're having and the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| continuing I see no situation in which my family would not continue to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8766)|
| 2:26:13| control of this property into the distant future it was purchased for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8773)|
| 2:26:17| purpose and plans have already been put in place to make sure that that is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| to continue to happen I I have no way to overcome the fear of somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| doing something else with the property but all I can do is demonstrate a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| history of doing what I say I'm going to do and the fact that I've already spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| thousand and again it's not part of the zoning process but I've demonstrated the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| fact that I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars in engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| architecture fees to keep the neighbors involved of what my go plans are for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| property but I do ask you to support the strong staff recommendation just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8807)|
| 2:26:52| the r2 rezoning and an overwhelming vote at the Planning Commission for the r2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| rezoning to allow me to move forward with the project thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8817)|
| 2:27:04| councilman Roberto Thank You mayor mr. jargon can I ask you a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8824)|
| 2:27:11| following up on your statement it sounds to me from reading your reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8831)|
| 2:27:18| the packet in your email and and I appreciate that and I also appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| you working hard to be communicating with the neighbors in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| that's always a very welcome thing to hear is your plan to have four single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8846)|
| 2:27:34| family homes on that property yes okay thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8854)|
| 2:27:44| any more questions for mr. Jernigan and then you have another person so I'm miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8864)|
| 2:27:49| testament you have to unmute yeah sorry mr. Jernigan I was just gonna ask I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8869)|
| 2:27:58| and again it sounds to me that the concern is that you wouldn't be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8878)|
| 2:28:06| fulfill your obligation and then a potential developer may come in and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| something definitely outside really the scale and scope of the neighborhood but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| it sounds to me and if you could just clarify and verify that you that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| really worked hard to keep with the integrity of the neighborhood the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| integrity of the area that it's in to keep it you know virtually in scale with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8903)|
| 2:28:29| the surrounding houses and neighborhood and I thank you very much for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8909)|
| 2:28:37| question that has been exactly what we've tried made the effort to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| because we I do this and our family views it as a long-term asset for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| family it is in our best interest that we do something which works within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8925)|
| 2:28:52| guidelines of the neighborhood and the scope of the neighborhood and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| which was the reason that I began to get the neighbors involved while I had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8936)|
| 2:28:59| property under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| them involved all the way through the process the when we had the meeting one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| of the decisions that we were making at the time was to develop to create an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| opportunity for diversity of housing in the zip code in this area we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| doing a more intensive development of the property but after meeting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| neighbors seeing and spending some time understanding what was going on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| neighborhood specifically it is just realistic to develop the property as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| four residential houses it works beautifully with all the other houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| that are in the neighborhood it's a these houses will be all in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8980)|
| 2:29:45| 2300 square foot range which is very much in keeping with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| that's there so we're we really I have worked very hard my architect has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8989)|
| 2:29:55| very hard and the engineering firm has worked very hard to create the the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| plan that you have and house plans that you have as our demonstration as to how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| this project is going to move forward and several of the neighbors if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| correct are okay with the four units versus the fear of it could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9008)|
| 2:30:16| be up to eight so but they seem to be on board with the fact that you were you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9016)|
| 2:30:23| were now have scaled it back to four so when I received the email from Elsbeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9023)|
| 2:30:31| about that they were they would accept four residential lots I have moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| forward with four residential lots and no other plan since then and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| demonstrated that that's all that we're planning to do the there is no way for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| me to be able to demonstrate there there's no way to overcome their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9043)|
| 2:30:50| objection about something else happening to the property other than the fact of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| the statements that I'm making right now and the fact that I have demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| the absolute effort to spend the money to prove to them that what I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9057)|
| 2:31:02| for can be done and will be so they haven't really objected to you they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9062)|
| 2:31:07| just there's a fear factor there on on again should something you default or it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9067)|
| 2:31:14| be foreclosed upon that's been what I've understood is their primary objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9074)|
| 2:31:20| exactly thank you thank you mr. Thomas yes mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9080)|
| 2:31:27| as the code is now as the zoning is now how many residences could you build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9087)|
| 2:31:34| technically you can I can build three I can build three with the size of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9094)|
| 2:31:39| property that's there today I can build three residential houses okay thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9099)|
| 2:31:45| any other questions for mr. Jernigan oh sorry thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9105)|
| 2:31:53| hi mr. Jernigan and looking at the site plans it looks like there's almost a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9113)|
| 2:32:02| natural cutoff with the commercial building next door to your property but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9122)|
| 2:32:14| the the changing the zoning of your property extends that you know it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9134)|
| 2:32:23| let me go to the question my question is is there a plan for any sort of buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9143)|
| 2:32:29| to help distinguish one area one zoning area from the r1 residential zoning area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9149)|
| 2:32:39| that is part of the effectively the r2 zoning is a transitional residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9159)|
| 2:32:46| zoning that allows for a greater diversity of housing types in a low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| density residential development a low density residential area the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9171)|
| 2:32:56| that you just on the r3 zoning whether it should be low density or not is clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9176)|
| 2:33:02| that the r2 density by that discussion alone it's clear that the r2 zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9182)|
| 2:33:08| an acceptable zoning for low density residential it just simply allows for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| some flexibility of this the r2 designation allows for flexibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| design and we need that flexibility because of the size of the lot to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9198)|
| 2:33:24| able to get the four residential properties on there and to lay it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| without any need of variances and so the lots that are there are all laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| without any variances being needed for the properties and as you've seen from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9213)|
| 2:33:37| other zoning's that have gone forward being able to make a plan that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| we're going to need variances is a mistake for but would be coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9222)|
| 2:33:48| for a subdivision so we wanted a proof-of-concept site plan which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9228)|
| 2:33:51| what I provided that shows that we we need the r2 zoning to be able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9231)|
| 2:33:56| the four lots that I've said we were going to do I hope that wasn't too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9236)|
| 2:34:00| with an answer I didn't mean to be rambling now and I imagine the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| and the drawings look look lovely and there's there are actually details on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| the house I imagine these are you're planning to sell at market rate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| are there it will be certainly at a it will not be an inexpensive place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9255)|
| 2:34:23| right yeah thank you thank you miss Parker any more questions for mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9263)|

| 2:35:11| you need the address again please okay 810 oak grove Lane and I'm speaking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9311)|
| 2:35:22| behalf of my neighbors Elspeth Freeman and man Johnson Morgan as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9322)|
| 2:35:29| myself I want to first of all I also appreciate as do my neighbors Victor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9329)|
| 2:35:39| Victor Jernigan's reaching out to us about his plans before he burned them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9339)|
| 2:35:47| that said there are a couple of errors I would say in what he said one was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9347)|
| 2:35:58| we never contemplated going outside of an r1 or rm1 zoning the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9358)|
| 2:36:09| when we discussed the when we got together and discussed the options that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9369)|
| 2:36:15| he had he laid out some options that we entertained but then privately talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9375)|
| 2:36:23| no we want to kids stay with the r1 zoning so we came back to him and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9383)|
| 2:36:31| if you can do it with four houses go for it the and the his drawings look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9391)|
| 2:36:38| attractive for sure it appears that but then without telling us he decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9398)|
| 2:36:47| see our two zoning so there was not a discussion at that point what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| subsequently suggested to him was that he could either tear down the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9413)|
| 2:37:00| house which is making it difficult to put the four single-family houses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| or he could instead of having a having three additional single-family houses he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9425)|
| 2:37:15| could have a duplex which he would grant that he would have to get special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9435)|
| 2:37:20| use permission but he would not have to get rezoning and then have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| additional house so we were in turn we responded with flexibility but we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| want to have the lot rezone and it is not simply out of fear the basis for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9453)|
| 2:37:46| concern is well first of all we are in a deep recession so who knows what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9466)|
| 2:37:54| to happen and mr. Jernigan for all of his good intentions and his commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9474)|
| 2:38:05| to this property may or may not be able to continue to carry out the plan as he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9485)|
| 2:38:13| contemplates now at which point he would sell the property and the zoning would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| run with the land I we also have fairly good reason to believe that mr. Jernigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9498)|
| 2:38:29| in the past has had some projects that he's been unable to complete so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| not simply fear-based so where we are headed with this is if he can do it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9514)|
| 2:38:43| our one zoning we're fine with that but we do not want to take on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9523)|
| 2:38:53| that is zoned R2 and then end up having not four houses but eight residences on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9533)|
| 2:39:01| a one acre lot what that would mean in terms of the street let me describe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| street because it's very unusual the street is a total of 700 feet long half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9546)|
| 2:39:14| of that runs on the the nursing home fronts on half of that the remainder as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9554)|
| 2:39:21| you go up a hill which does provide a visual sort of change is the remainder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| of that so 350 feet consists of mr. Jernigan's thought and the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9567)|

| 2:40:31| subdivision of that particular lot it is our concern about how radical changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9631)|
| 2:40:39| would occur to our street I also would like to mention that like that Oak Grove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9639)|

| 2:41:11| to you all today mr. mr. Davis Ron Davis grew up in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9671)|
| 2:41:18| neighborhood in the lines the neighborhood the neighborhood has prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9678)|
| 2:41:24| or I'm not sure if you're keeping time but five minutes has elapsed okay um it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9684)|
| 2:41:31| yeah miss English could you I think some people might have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| for you so all right let's go to questions pause and see if anyone has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| question that sounds good councilmembers any questions for miss English okay miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9699)|
| 2:41:49| English I think I think they have the information they need from you and and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9709)|
| 2:41:55| think they got the emails as well did everybody get the email she spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| okay mr. Roberto Thank You mayor I've got some questions for director green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9719)|
| 2:42:07| the the property in question here is less than an acre and is currently zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9727)|
| 2:42:15| are in one and so what I wanted to ask you is I guess in a theoretical sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9735)|
| 2:42:22| under existing zoning ordinance can up to four single-family homes be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| on a lot that would be a little less than an acre as the minimum lot size is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| 10,000 square feet for each single-family home theoretically there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| would have to be access and public street access and if a new street is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| required there may not be the ability to get four lots from 10,000 40,000 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9761)|
| 2:42:48| feet and then in the same sense if you're instead it's dealing with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9768)|
| 2:42:55| rn2 zone would it be up to eight single-family homes permitted on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| same size lot or up to four duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| again theoretically but the big difference is with four lots a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9786)|
| 2:43:12| public easement which has fewer standards than a public street could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| provided to provide access with us six or more lots a public street is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| and that would take a 50-foot right away property so it's very doubtful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9803)|
| 2:43:31| that eight lots could be developed on a 40,000 square foot property but it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9811)|
| 2:43:38| be maybe as many as six possibly six yes sir in your experience could Oak Grove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9818)|
| 2:43:47| Lane support the potential increased density permitted in rn2 in its current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9827)|
| 2:43:52| condition as to on-street parking or increased traffic in its current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9832)|
| 2:43:58| condition it would be challenging but part of the review process for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| development of this property of the size we're speaking with the rn2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| designation would require review by the City Department of Engineering and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| review would likely require upgrades to Oak Grove Lane to in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| accommodate any traffic generated well considering that the rn1 would at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9857)|
| 2:44:26| a theoretical sense allow for the development that the developers seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| here I'm not in support of the rezoning when you look at the totality of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9870)|
| 2:44:37| situation here the cohesiveness of this neighborhood and the historic nature of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9877)|
| 2:44:42| this neighborhood this is a historically African-American neighborhood that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| really a very special place I've really enjoyed going to neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| there and you know hopefully when we get past these points where we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| zoom meetings I can resume doing that you know I think that this can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9895)|
| 2:45:01| accomplished in rn1 so I'd make a motion to deny the rn2 zoning motion made to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9901)|
| 2:45:11| second by mr. Thomas mayor mr. Jernigan was seeking recognition a minute ago I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9911)|
| 2:45:19| don't know if council wants to call on him first miss Testerman miss Testerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9919)|
| 2:45:29| I can't you got on you thank you all right oh that's what I was gonna ask if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9929)|
| 2:45:36| mr. Jernigan could come back and you know provide feedback to both what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9936)|
| 2:45:43| councilman Roberto and miss English had to say yes thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9943)|
| 2:45:52| thank you for the opportunity and we we have I have looked at my engineers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9952)|
| 2:45:58| looked at these very issues in trying to reach a compromise with miss English in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| some way to look at doing the property the the ability to do more as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9962)|
| 2:46:11| mentioned to you originally in the meeting that we had I've looked at on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9971)|
| 2:46:16| schematically if you laid out eight townhomes and left and built a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| family residence tore down the house that was there and we looked at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| that would the infrastructure that would be required to do that the the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9983)|
| 2:46:28| development that that would entail and so it becomes a situation a councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9988)|
| 2:46:35| Roberto where mathematically it becomes impossible to to do something of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| scale at that intensity on this piece of property and make the math work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| where if you look at a doing the four residential lots and we look at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10007)|
| 2:46:53| long-term asset value with a joint permanent easement everything fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| we're able to design it so that it works on the property and meet all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10017)|
| 2:47:03| needs of what the goal of creating diversity of housing for people because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10023)|
| 2:47:10| we do identify the population of people that will live in this neighborhood as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| people who can't afford to live in the houses which are immediately around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| there but they want to have access they want to have nice housing single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10038)|
| 2:47:22| detached housing close to Lakeshore Park at a price that they can afford and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10042)|
| 2:47:26| so we're able to accomplish that with these design standards the issue of we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10046)|
| 2:47:32| don't physically have enough land to create the three it doesn't appear to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| have the ability to get more than three lots plus the infrastructure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10058)|
| 2:47:43| need on the size property that we have or I would just do the four lots if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10063)|
| 2:47:47| had more land then obviously we wouldn't be having this conversation I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| need the r2 zoning to give the flexibility of design and the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| of greater just don't play out with the way the mathematics of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10076)|
| 2:48:04| would go forward as mr. Green has talked about I hope that there's an answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10084)|
| 2:48:10| that question because we looked at it very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| mr. Srin did you have any other questions for mr. Jernigan no I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10095)|
| 2:48:22| think that said you know I know that mr. Jernigan is has been doing this for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| know several decades and and you know I guess just look going through the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10107)|
| 2:48:33| that we received like a lot of the neighbors were on board with you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10113)|
| 2:48:39| we're okay with the four we're not okay with the eight and it just you know I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10119)|
| 2:48:46| a little perplexed by that that he I feel like he's tried to meet with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| neighbors and he's tried to explain to them exactly what he's taken their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| recommendations and moved from townhomes to single-family and so I feel like he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10135)|
| 2:49:01| tried to comply with all of their wishes based on the emails we've gotten and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| you know the information that he's brought forth so plus to keep in mind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10146)|
| 2:49:11| also has to go back to Planning Commission for approval so you know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10151)|
| 2:49:19| been a great deal of money to ensure that it's within the scale and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10163)|
| 2:49:26| Miss Fugate and then I'll go to Mr. Thomas. Thank you I just have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10166)|
| 2:49:36| question because it's getting a little late and I'm getting a little confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| about land zoning. Am I hearing this correctly that R2 means there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10180)|
| 2:49:50| variance to do four lots but if it stayed R1 someone could go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10190)|
| 2:49:56| Planning Commission and ask for a variance to do four houses? Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10196)|
| 2:50:03| answer that for me. Director Green could you answer that? Okay took a while to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| unmute but I the variance would be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10211)|
| 2:50:16| Planning Commission and the in order to receive a variance a hardship has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10216)|
| 2:50:21| shown and that hardship has to be something other than economic so I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10221)|
| 2:50:27| project whether the Board of Zoning Appeals would grant a variance or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| variance would have to be thank you you answered all four lots on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10230)|
| 2:50:37| is zoned now you answered my question I was trying to figure out why we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| going for R2 because if you if you stayed at R1 you have to get a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10243)|
| 2:50:48| variance which is what we dealt with with the South Knox I'm learning all my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| variances. Okay thank you Mr. Green. Thank you Ms. Fugate. Mr. Thomas. Yeah a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10253)|
| 2:51:00| comment I suppose it seems to be like the real true middle ground here is Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10260)|
| 2:51:06| Jernigan has said that he can build three houses zoned as is and that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10266)|
| 2:51:13| be an increase of density in the neighborhood so that's the main reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10273)|
| 2:51:20| that I'm going to oppose the rezoning. Mr. Jernigan I wanted to applaud him for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10280)|
| 2:51:25| his outreach to the neighbors he's a very experienced developer has done some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10285)|
| 2:51:30| good projects but I guess my suggestion in this case would be keep the zoning as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10290)|
| 2:51:37| is build within the zoning and you will still have the three houses. Thank You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10297)|
| 2:51:44| Mr. Thomas. Any further comments or questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10304)|
| 2:51:51| I'm just curious from Mr. Jernigan if he had already explored that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10311)|
| 2:51:57| option. Mr. Jernigan could you answer if you've explored that option? We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10317)|
| 2:52:06| looked at that option extensively and one of the reasons that we waited for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10326)|
| 2:52:10| the rezoning for the recode process to go into effect and it was a purposeful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| waiting of the rezoning was because the recode process and the City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| the Planning Commission spent two years talking about the ability to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| greater housing diversity opportunities in every zone in Knoxville. We waited and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10345)|
| 2:52:33| I brought the zoning forward after recode had been in place and had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| discussed at two separate City Council meetings so that the goal of creating a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10358)|
| 2:52:45| diversity of housing it's this is single-family detached housing it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10365)|

| 2:52:56| the density of the property. The issue is that with the R2 zoning we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10376)|
| 2:53:03| allowed to get four lots with no need to request variances. I've talked to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10383)|

| 2:53:18| I have right by right to build the houses then I can go back and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| modifying the plan and possibly maybe the mathematics works out and we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| a duplex. But the only way that we know we can really ensure a quality project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10409)|
| 2:53:34| to meet the guidelines of what the City of Knoxville needs as far as diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10414)|

| 2:54:00| diversity of housing not three more McMansions built next to the Veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10440)|

| 2:54:10| chosen to put a plan together that ensures the property will remain an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| asset for my family for decades to come. We've looked at these different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10453)|
| 2:54:18| multiple times and again I ask you to give me the flexibility to design the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10458)|
| 2:54:23| project for four single-family homes in an R2 zone. We've shown the good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| effort that what we're going to do I understand Councilman Roberto's issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| for the for the neighborhood which is the reason that when we stepped back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10473)|
| 2:54:37| looked at it we looked at the neighborhood we've come forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| this design plan and those have known me for a long time know I am looking always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10480)|
| 2:54:47| for a way to keep the neighbors involved and design something that has great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| value into the future and that's what we've done here and I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| understand the concerns of the neighbors but we have done everything to do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10493)|
| 2:54:59| the City of Knoxville has spent years in designing with the recode process what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| came up in this Congress this very council meeting just a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10504)|

| 2:55:15| property and you couldn't have a more perfect transitional piece than this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10515)|
| 2:55:19| to transition from an R6 zone to the R1 zone and again I I do appreciate very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10519)|

| 2:57:54| able to speak to you all as we go through these pandemic times. I've sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10674)|
| 2:57:57| through the entire meeting and I have to commend some things amazingly that last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10677)|
| 2:58:01| one especially Victor Jonaghan is a crook. He is known for profiting off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10681)|
| 2:58:04| poverty and as a veteran letting him build a property next door to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| Veterans Cemetery would definitely be what exactly the thing that he's trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10688)|
| 2:58:12| to speak against because he would definitely price gouge and do the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| thing as the company that wanted to do in the first place. I really did with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| honesty of the company I wanted to do in the first place and somebody's lying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| saying that they won't do it. But moving on I want to first start off by talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| about the coronavirus response and how we have poorly been handling that. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| know I would love to sit there and let y'all congratulate yourselves and pat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| yourselves on the back but let's be honest y'all have not been on ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| zero at all. I know that because myself and NextUp Initiative have been the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10714)|
| 2:58:38| on ground. I would still like to have a response from the police department in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| the matter of who told the police last week to go down there and destroy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| homeless property because as me and Addie Parr both recognized that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| property that y'all destroyed was donated to us through the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| People supported our causes and believed in us and you all went out and destroyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| that property so that's like thousands of dollars of equipment and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| that cost the public money like the tents do cost money, the sleeping bags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10739)|
| 2:59:03| cost money, the personal hygiene products cost money, the clothing cost money, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| shoes cost money and other like the non-personal items cost money. So y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| destroy stuff that the community supported us with and destroyed money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| Somebody said it was okay because they said they used bulldozers and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| have not actually seen the post from the message from a person from the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| who told me the story let me know because I can tell you to it because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| shared it. Additionally the fact there's no excuse to not have the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| outside because we have a whole Easttown mall we just closed that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| boarded up. We could have made that into an emergency shelter and even put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| health care and other resources right there on the spot and quarantine and use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| the space to intake and output people that are healthy versus those who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| ill. It's too big to not use that space or better yet the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| that's public property that's in the city. You talk about the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| versus things but we have property right in the city that we could use easily. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| issue still comes to the fact tax dollars are still not being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| appropriately. Addition to the fact y'all are still not doing what we as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| public asked you to do as our representation. So it comes back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| main problem as I told you before. Coronavirus didn't cause homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| Coronavirus didn't cause poverty. Coronavirus didn't cause loss of income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10803)|
| 3:00:07| and other resources that we have been losing in our communities. It exploited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10807)|
| 3:00:11| it is what it did and the fact that we have watched not only our local state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10811)|
| 3:00:14| and federal governments use this opportunity not to help people but to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| exploit it even farther makes me disgustingly sick as a veteran. I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| believe the things you have been doing. In addition to the fact you want to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10822)|
| 3:00:25| money to the big business, no give it to the grassroots organizations on ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| zero. You talk about us being a factor of spreading, no we've been a factor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| helping. You have done nothing India Kincanning. Where's the food at for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10832)|

| 3:00:38| when they lost their jobs? Y'all talking about suspending pay, no forgive pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| because people lost their jobs in this time. 72 hours after we lift this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10842)|

| 3:01:01| disgusting. I cannot take it anymore. That's why we are moving from political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10861)|

| 3:02:47| me? Yes. Okay, so David Hayes. I'm a member of the Coast Guard. I'm here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10967)|
| 3:02:55| address 1312 Hawthorne Avenue. I just want to share some more concerns in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10975)|
| 3:03:05| community. First off, I do want to give some appreciation to the mayor and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10985)|
| 3:03:10| for taking some action and taking some leadership in this moment. But obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10990)|
| 3:03:18| as Constance said, there's still more that the city can do to step up. But also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=10998)|
| 3:03:23| in contrast, it's unfortunate that the county mayor has taken needed action. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| we haven't seen the urgency around resourcing and coordinating social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| services. And they have a larger budget than the city. So we need to see more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11013)|
| 3:03:38| action from the county. So folks in the community are concerned about the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| of the virus within the jails because of the poor practices that inmates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| reporting. Just so folks know that most folks in jail haven't even been convicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| yet. But regardless, everyone deserves to be safe. So we need to be depopulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11031)|
| 3:03:57| our jail and not just adding a lot more folks to it. So right now, restees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11037)|
| 3:04:03| saying that they have to sign guilty plea deals to get out. And if not, they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| stay in jail. So what's happening is unjust and counterproductive to public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| Also, we wanted to echo what Councilwoman Parker said about resourcing grassroots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11052)|
| 3:04:17| NGOs and nonprofits, not just the ones who are established. So we need to grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11057)|
| 3:04:22| money to folks on the front lines and make it accessible to folks on the front lines and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11062)|
| 3:04:26| connect the United Way and 211 and the Emergency Operations Center with folks on the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| line so we can make sure that everybody is being reached with the resources that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| Also want to say that the guest house for houseless folks that's housing up to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11076)|
| 3:04:41| houseless folks is a good step, but still not enough to what we need to be doing during this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11081)|
| 3:04:45| crisis. Home health care workers, folks who are going in and out of homes are lacking PPE right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| now. So folks think the city should take some leadership in that. This concerns over enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11090)|
| 3:04:57| over executive orders and the state of emergency. So just want to say that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11097)|
| 3:05:03| maintaining public safety, but not, I repeat, not criminalizing communities and not limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| the essential movements of residents around the city. Right now, we're seeing that all public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11108)|
| 3:05:14| and essential workers deserve a living wage inside and outside of this crisis right now. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11114)|
| 3:05:20| many city employees are risking their lives going in and out of people's homes and touching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11120)|
| 3:05:24| all these things and around crowds of people. And it's not just KPD. So all city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11124)|
| 3:05:29| deserve great pay right now. And next, I'm going to highlight some things from the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11129)|
| 3:05:35| movement's petition for demands for local government. I'm just going to highlight a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11135)|
| 3:05:40| things. If you haven't seen it yet, it will be sent to you. Over 600 people have signed on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11140)|
| 3:05:45| this petition. So some highlights are we want the city to actually guarantee paid sick leave to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11145)|
| 3:05:51| city employees, not just the ones who qualify, but all city employees and making sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11151)|
| 3:05:56| finding ways to incentivize private businesses to follow and do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| We want to see no evictions during this crisis. And we're glad to see the moratorium on evictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| by KCDC, but we need to see them forgive the payments so folks aren't just accruing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11166)|
| 3:06:12| more debt and payments right now when they can't even work. And same with KUB. We're glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| they're not shutting people's power off and utilities off, but we need to see them forgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| these payments right now so folks aren't just burying in debt. We need to see more preventative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11180)|
| 3:06:26| measures and sanitation products and free medical testing and free treatment for all houseless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| individuals. So this also backs up what Councilwoman Parker said before about the need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11190)|
| 3:06:35| hand washing stations. So that's just a drop in the bucket as far as what's needed in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11195)|
| 3:06:40| communities. Lastly, I wanted to highlight the point of guaranteeing non-enforcement of warrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11200)|
| 3:06:49| and immigration enforcement. So not enforcing warrants and immigration at homes, supermarkets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| schools, traffic stops, health care sites, and other places where essential services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11214)|
| 3:06:59| are provided. So again, we don't need to be criminalizing folks. We need to be keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11219)|
| 3:07:04| folks safe. And very last thing, I just want to say that poor and working class communities have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11224)|
| 3:07:09| been in a crisis before this pandemic. So folks are going to need even more support after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11229)|
| 3:07:16| So we're going to need to see more support going to housing and social services. And the last thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11236)|
| 3:07:20| we need to do is implement austerity measures. So the more resources that the city can start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11240)|
| 3:07:25| looking to now to make sure that we can have people's back when this is all over and during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11245)|
| 3:07:29| this, the better. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Hayes. That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11249)|
| 3:07:37| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200407?start=11257)|
