| 0:01:26| Thank you for your presence, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Okay, so we have a quorum. The first item on the agenda is the presentation of the fiscal year 23-24 major activities and the financial status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=87)|
| 0:01:37| And Director Brooks, I'll let you take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Thank you, Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| So today I'll be sharing a brief presentation with you all, as I do every year, about what we've been working on over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=102)|
| 0:01:53| The Commission reviewed 524 cases over this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| These numbers are comparable to the cases reviewed last year, though I'm sure it's no surprise to you that this count is up from previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=118)|
| 0:02:08| Just on average, our staff review over 90 different types of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| Obviously, you all only hear about half of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Only half of those go to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| This is just a snapshot of some of the development activity that we have seen throughout the county last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| This topic is reported more extensively in our development activity report, which was recently released and should be available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| And we will do a presentation to you all at your next agenda review meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=155)|
| 0:02:44| I try to keep you all updated on a monthly basis, so some of these project updates will hopefully sound familiar to you, but I'll just briefly go through them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=164)|
| 0:02:55| We've been very busy over the last year, not just processing applications, but working on additional tasks related to significant projects for both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=175)|
| 0:03:06| One was the Missy Middle zoning amendments that we helped draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| And then, of course, Advanced Stocks, which was the county's new comprehensive land use and transportation plan, as well as updates to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=191)|
| 0:03:32| So transportation planning highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| The Roadway Safety Action Plan, we reported on this project last year, but we're happy to report that the TPO Executive Board adopted this plan last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| And so by completing and adopting it, the TPO and local member jurisdictions are now able to apply for federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| Mobility Plan 2050, we kicked that off as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| This plan will examine the current state of transportation in and around the Knoxville region and make recommendations for future investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| The first round of public engagement concluded in February of this year, and the next round is scheduled for the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| The TPO successfully completed the Federal Certification Review of the Metropolitan Transportation Planning and Programming Process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| This happens every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| Staff are very pleased to say that they received praises for the organizational structure that we've set up for the TPO, performance-based planning that they undertake, as well as programming, and then how we manage our transportation improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=259)|
| 0:04:37| Staff from our Information Services Division continue to lend significant expertise to our local partners by providing content, design, and programming support for their websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=277)|
| 0:04:50| We also play an important role in the website support for the Knoxville Chamber, the Industrial Development Board, obviously the TPO, and then projects like Advanced Knox and Breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=290)|
| 0:05:04| The Breathe project is a partnership with the City of Knoxville in planning, and we are partnering on what is called the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant for the Knoxville MSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=304)|
| 0:05:16| We've reported out on this previously, but we worked with them to develop a brand and a website, and we are working on their outreach program that will engage communities within our MSA, and that will result in a comprehensive climate action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=316)|
| 0:05:30| We've also worked closely with the City of Knoxville on their housing strategy. We provided research and data management in support of that new strategy, and we'll continue to support them in their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=330)|
| 0:05:43| Our fees continue to exceed what we have budgeted, as evidenced by your agendas and the length of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| State and federal grants referenced here are administered by our Transportation Planning Group, and the majority of these dollars, I know it encompasses a significant portion of this pie chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=351)|
| 0:06:02| the majority of those dollars are reallocated out to our partners throughout the region, and those are for specific projects as part of the TPO work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=362)|
| 0:06:12| As with most organizations, our employees are our greatest asset, and they are also our largest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| Contracted services, listed up here in the teal blue, light blue, those include legal services, public notices, equipment, data storage, software, licensing, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=378)|
| 0:06:32| Supplies and materials include food, computer equipment, office supplies, our two agency vehicles, and other charges that include space costs, financial and central services that we pay to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=392)|
| 0:06:45| We try to be a good steward of our dollars, and as a result of that we've remained in solid financial standing this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=405)|
| 0:06:54| And with that, that concludes my presentation. If anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=414)|
| 0:07:04| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| We'll move on to item number two, which is the election of the Planning Commission Officers for Chair and Vice Chair, and Commissioner Rich Levison is going to take over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=430)|
| 0:07:23| Presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| I'd like to make a recommendation that Commissioner Hill be Chair for next year, and Commissioner Huber be Vice Chair for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=449)|
| 0:07:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| That's been brought forward, and I don't think we open, or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Well, you can have discussion, and then there should be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Okay. So if there is any other discussion, we can have that now. If there is anybody else that has a substitute motion, I think we would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=475)|
| 0:08:06| Alright. Does nobody else have anything else to discuss? Then we'll allow for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| I move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Motion by Commissioner Levison, seconded by Nathaniel. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=500)|
| 0:08:28| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Seeing none, we will adjourn the annual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=517)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=530)|
| 0:09:06| We will turn it over to Executive Director Brooks for her report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| So now I'm going to jump into this year's work program and budget. It's on your agenda for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| So I'll just take a few more minutes to go over our proposed budget. You have a copy of our work program in front of you, or you should, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=563)|
| 0:09:33| Okay, so for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| So this work program has been reviewed by City Council, the City Administration, as well as Knox County, and it has been recommended for approval by the Executive Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=575)|
| 0:09:47| So we've organized our work program by city, county, and agency, and tasks are organized in the following manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| So we have prescribed and ongoing, and these are items we are obligated to perform on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| And then we have something called prescribed reoccurring, and these items are items that we perform yearly or as needed, such as a one-year plan would be an example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=601)|
| 0:10:11| Actually, I'll run through some of these. So we, you know, serving as an information resource on matters related to zoning, just as a matter of practice, we answer phone calls and emails every day about zoning, long-range planning, as well as other development applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=611)|
| 0:10:27| Reviewing and rezoning subdivision development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Then we provide staff support to you all, as well as the Historic Zoning Commission, the Design Review Board, the TTCDA, and the Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=631)|
| 0:10:43| We provide mapping and website development, as I mentioned just a couple minutes ago, and data analysis and in-kind resources to our partner organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=643)|
| 0:10:51| We also manage various local and regional transportation grants and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| So those are just some of the things that are encompassed in those two areas that I mentioned on our work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| Special projects. These are projects that may be multi-year or shorter-term projects added at the request of the city or the county, and some of these might include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| we are currently working on adding all TTCDA and Historic Zoning Commission and Design Review Board cases to the public-facing map, like we have for Planning Commission cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=673)|
| 0:11:25| We plan to update and modernize downtown design review and infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| We're also working really closely with the city on code reviews, zoning code updates, and trying to make those more timely and efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| Assisting the successful administration and review of the middle housing ordinance amendments and developments that we hope to see come online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| And then providing strategic planning support for projects such as reconnecting communities, the city's attainable housing strategy, CATS implementation of the reimagined routes, and then of course the Breathe project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=707)|
| 0:12:01| So special projects identified for this year in the county are primarily centered around implementation of the new comprehensive land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=721)|
| 0:12:11| These can be found on pages 8 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Those include items such as development of a new zoning code as part of the unified development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| We'll also be looking at the subdivision regulations and making sure that everything aligns with this new plan that we've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| We'll be conducting historic resources and inventory updates, looking at access management standards in partnership with Knox County, and then providing training and technical assistance around implementation measures that have been identified as part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=746)|
| 0:12:39| So again, these are just a sample of things that we'll be working on, specifically in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| So as you all know, our budget is driven by these projects, but also the day-to-day operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| So our revenues and expenditures each total approximately $8.1 million for the upcoming fiscal year, and this is a combination of a number of different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=772)|
| 0:13:05| So local appropriations from the city and county are a very important part of a source of funding for us, and they equal about 31% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| 18% of that comes from the city of Knoxville, and then 13% from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Both the city and county have provided generous increases to us for this upcoming fiscal year, and this is to fulfill our annual obligations, but also in recognition of the growing list of requests that we're receiving from them and the complexity of those requests, as well as the requests that come before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=798)|
| 0:13:39| We estimate that our fee revenue will remain in the 8% range, total agency revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=819)|
| 0:13:46| Again, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, applications have been up over the last year, and we anticipate that this trend will continue, so we'll monitor those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=826)|
| 0:13:57| Grant reimbursements are down a little bit from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| They comprise approximately 51% of our revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Again, as I mentioned, these dollars come from a variety of state and federal sources, and much of the work that we do within the transportation planning group is reimbursable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=844)|
| 0:14:14| But it sounds like a big chunk of our revenues come from this, but approximately of that $4.1 million that we take in, $3.4 million is then going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=854)|
| 0:14:23| Again, we serve as a pass-through agency in support of our local partners, both here in Knox County, but across the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| We do plan to attempt to increase our staff over the next few months to help us execute what I think is a fairly ambitious work program, and then we'll be looking for opportunities as we have been over the last couple of years to grow our staff internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=871)|
| 0:14:45| We want to make sure that we retain talent and institutional knowledge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Does anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=890)|
| 0:14:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Just a couple quick announcements before I turn it over to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| So next month, we would like to have a workshop with you all specifically about the Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| I mentioned this last month, and we'd like to provide some resources for you all to use as you're reviewing cases related to amending that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=912)|
| 0:15:23| You will be seeing the first amendments come forward in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| A couple dates that I'm looking at is Tuesday, July 9th, which is your agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| If we could start a little bit earlier at 10 a.m., or Wednesday, July 17th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| I can send out a larger doodle poll to everybody, but I would like to ask if anybody has any concerns about coming a little bit earlier to agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=935)|
| 0:15:44| I hate to ask you all to come to a third meeting in a month, because I know you're already here twice a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| We'll get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| So now I'm going to turn it over to Michelle to go over 6C.24.0B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| These are amendments to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Staff is proposing amendments to 6C.24.0B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| These are amendments to the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| Staff is proposing amendments to the current version of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| These were most recently adopted in April 2024, but following the adoption of those amendments, we discovered a few inconsistencies that require some correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=983)|
| 0:16:32| Additionally, a few surveyors had questions about some of the intent of some of the sections, and so we've made some modifications to clarify any confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=992)|
| 0:16:41| You do have a list of every amendment within your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| However, today we're just going to provide a brief review of some of the more important amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| If you guys have any questions about any of the other ones, I'm happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| So if you have any questions or want any more in-depth information, the staff memo and the actual track changes version is within the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1013)|
| 0:17:03| Okay, so diving in, item number four on your memo, staff discovered a discrepancy in two sections of the subdivision regulations regarding when access, easement, maintenance agreements must be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1023)|
| 0:17:16| So section 3.03i, which is up on your screen now, requires approval of the agreement document by the law department prior to plat certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1036)|
| 0:17:26| However, when you look at section 2.10c1 regarding incomplete final plats to be reviewed by the planning commission, it currently requires all relevant corrections, certifications, verifications, and approvals to be approved by the appropriate law department prior to the plat being considered by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1046)|
| 0:17:44| And that would include, of course, the law department's approval of the maintenance agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| So to correct this inconsistency, the wording in section 2.10c1g was revised to eliminate the requirement for access, easement, maintenance agreements to be approved prior to plat corrections deadline and instead comply with the legal documentation section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1067)|
| 0:18:06| The next one is item seven on the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| The city of Knoxville has different requirements for when a subdivision must be tied to their survey control system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| This is based on the number of lots in the subdivision and distances from an approved control point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| So there's a phrase in section 2.10f2b that was changed during the last amendments, and it said from shall be required, and then we changed it to may be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1100)|
| 0:18:31| However, this caused some confusion. Multiple surveyors contacted the city about the change, and so we are now revising it back to say shall, unless tied to the system, unless deemed otherwise by the city's department of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1111)|
| 0:18:45| So it still allows them to not require it in certain cases, but that determination will be made by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| Next is item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| So we received a few comments pertaining to the requirements for referencing adjacent landowners on plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| Several surveyors noted the requirements could have unforeseen consequences depending on the number of adjoining owners and additional text needed on the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1140)|
| 0:19:09| So we've revised this section to align with the surveyor's standards of practice, which will simplify the information that's required to be shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1149)|
| 0:19:21| So next, and this one's kind of a big one, this is items number nine, 16 through 21 and 24 on the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| This was a change made to article three, section 3.03 regarding access standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| So this was done in conjunction with the city's engineering department and county's engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| So they're both partnered with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| This amendment proposes to replace the three easement types we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| So we have an exclusive permanent access easement and a shared permanent access easement that both serve residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| and a permanent cross access easement that currently serves commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| So we are proposing to merge all of those together and just basically use the requirements that are found within the shared permanent access easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1198)|
| 0:20:07| but just change that to be just called an access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| So that more generic term will now have the same criteria as the spay or the shared permanent access easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| and it can be used for commercial and residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Like the shared permanent access easement, it could only serve up to five lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Once you hit six lots, you'd have to do a private right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| So as I said, it can be used for both commercial and residential, but with residential, that is for single family homes, duplexes, and townhomes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1228)|
| 0:20:38| And that's up to 10 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| And so we are hoping, as are the city and the county, that the creation of a singular term will be simpler for surveyors and for attorneys preparing legal documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1241)|
| 0:20:52| And with that, we are recommending approval of the proposed amendments with an effective date of June 14th, and I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1252)|
| 0:21:04| I actually do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| And all those changes look great. I think that's a great direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| And this might be a question for Joshua in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| We, I guess over the last six months or so, I was involved in a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| and I don't know if it's addressed in this or in another section of the city code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| specifically with respect to shared access easements of spays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| Joshua, do you remember what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| We had a regular subdivision, and we had a shared access easement that came off of that, that allows for five lots, as we know in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1291)|
| 0:21:41| But there was something buried in the city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I don't know if it was in this document or another city document that required all of the houses that were off, that were accessed off of that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1304)|
| 0:21:56| So if you can imagine a T, here's the main road of the subdivision, and there's a shared access easement that comes off in a 90 degree angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1316)|
| 0:22:05| And it required all of the houses to face the main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| So what we ended up with was five houses off of this shared access easement that were all, you know, stacked sideways, if you will, from it, you know, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1330)|
| 0:22:22| And we worked through it, but it was through an arduous Board of Zoning Appeals, and then had to appeal it again to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| It was just a lot of consternation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| And in looking at it, I think the general feel from the city was, yeah, maybe that was something that kind of slipped through the cracks when we were originally doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1354)|
| 0:22:42| So my ultimate question is, is that addressed here in this document, or is it a different document that forces the city council to do something about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1362)|
| 0:22:52| What forces that to happen in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Right, so I'm familiar with the project that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| That is in the zoning ordinance, the requirement for all houses to face the street, and I think just not anticipating that something like that would be built with that many houses going that deep into a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1377)|
| 0:23:06| So we are working on an ordinance amendment to address when multiple lots use an access easement, so that those houses can face the access easement instead of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1386)|
| 0:23:17| So that's going to be coming. I believe we've postponed it a couple of times now, so it will be on the July agenda, so you all should see that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1397)|
| 0:23:26| Yeah, very good. Thank you for the clarification. I just didn't see anything in there about it. I just wanted to make sure it was being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So now we will turn it over to Samuel for 5K24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| Staff is recommending a density that's lower than what is being requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Excuse me. This partial rezoning is for approximately 86 acres of the 156 acre property along Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1433)|
| 0:24:02| Boneygate Elementary is located less than one mile to the east, and Coffernords on Sevier Highway is located to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| Like Amy mentioned, the applicant requested five dwelling units, although they were later uploaded to the planning website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| They now want four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| The immediate area is predominantly zoned agricultural, although there are several residential developments within two miles with the pier zone close to Boneygate Elementary and South 12th High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1458)|
| 0:24:30| The immediate area is predominantly zoned agricultural, although there are several residential developments within two miles with the pier zone close to Boneygate Elementary and South 12th High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1470)|
| 0:24:48| The subject portion of the parcel is located within the planned growth area boundary, even though the other portion of the parcel that is not part of this rezoning is located to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1488)|
| 0:24:59| While the sector plan was the active plan at the time of the request, the property has the rural conservation place type right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1499)|
| 0:25:11| This allows consideration of the pier zone with a density up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| The general development pattern consists of small lot, detached houses, and single family subdivisions along Tipton Station Road with undeveloped lands further away from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1518)|
| 0:25:33| From the aerial view, you can see that the areas near the school are more developed than the area adjacent to the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1533)|
| 0:25:48| I'll turn on my pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| This is Boneygate Elementary and this is South 12th High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1554)|
| 0:26:03| The portion being rezoned is relatively flat. The portion south of the creek has steep slope, but it's not included in this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1563)|
| 0:26:13| Leaving the rear portion is consistent with the Comprehensive Plans Implementation Policy 7, which encourages development practices that conserve natural features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1573)|
| 0:26:24| Staff recommends approving the pier zone with up to two dwelling units per acre since this would be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1584)|
| 0:26:32| The pier zone is supported by the rural conservation place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| The recommended density of two dwelling units per acre considers the accessibility and surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| Along Tipton Station Road, the nearest property with five dwelling units per acre is next to South 12th High School and that has been developed yielding a density of only 2.56 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1604)|
| 0:27:02| Other nearby properties with pier at three and four dwelling units per acre are closer to those schools and have sidewalk connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1622)|
| 0:27:11| As you can see with the red lines in this map, the property has frontage for only one potential access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1631)|
| 0:27:21| With these considerations, the recommended density of two dwelling units per acre is more appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1641)|
| 0:27:32| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1652)|
| 0:27:41| Okay, looks like there's no questions. We'll move on to agenda item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| Staff is recommending denial of the risk request to go from ag to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| So this property is along Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| Like Amy mentioned, we're recommending denial of the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| The area is predominantly zoned agricultural. There is a series of CA zone properties on the south side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| However, majority of these properties have not been developed as commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| And KGS aerial view indicates that no new commercial development has been added to this area in the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1696)|
| 0:28:26| The property is located in the rural area designation of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| The CA zone is partially related. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Okay, so it has the rural living place type, which leaves the CA zone as partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| Partially related means that the zone can be considered in some locations with the place type, but we think that at this location it is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1724)|
| 0:28:54| In the existing land use map, we can see that most of the commercially zoned properties are developed as residential, even though they're zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1734)|
| 0:29:08| According to the historical images on KGS going back to 20 years, there have not been any substantial changes in the area, which warrants the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1748)|
| 0:29:19| The area remains rural in character. It is primarily composed of houses on larger than half acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1759)|
| 0:29:27| And there are undeveloped forested lands away from the street, as you can see on this map that has remained undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| So we recommend denial because the request does not meet all the conditions of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| The zoning ordinance states that CA zones should generally be located at street intersections and as close to the edge of a neighborhood as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1783)|
| 0:29:54| The property is located neither at an intersection nor at the edge of an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| Furthermore, it can be argued that the area does not have enough residential density to warrant any more commercially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1799)|
| 0:30:10| The East County plan identifies this road as a rural corridor, which recommends limiting infrastructure expansion on this corridor to preserve the rural look and feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1810)|
| 0:30:20| We think that the addition of another commercially zoned parcel road constitutes encroachment into this rural residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| In this street view, we can see that the property has thick vegetation in the front, except for this driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1829)|
| 0:30:40| You cannot really see the entire property from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Yes, Samuel, that string of commercial properties to the south, were you able to find what the history on those were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| Like what, when and why those were done that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| I think I looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| They have been zoned CA for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| If there are no other questions, I will move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| why those were done that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| I think I looked at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| They have been zoned CA for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| I don't think I've seen any rezoning cases for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1874)|
| 0:31:27| If there are no other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| I'll move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| It's going good, the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Next one's a city case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| So item 51 is a city rezoning from IH to CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| The flat plane overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| We are recommending approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| so I'm going to keep the presentation short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| But if you have any questions, we can look at KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| The property has the Gateway Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| misused district land disclassification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| which supports this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| As you're probably familiar with this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| it's north of Fifth Street and west of I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| The entire area is about 11.26 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| The existing IZ zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| is not reflective of the subject properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| current land use that has been vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| for about the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| As for changing condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| the city completed a $5.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| road expansion improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| along the western boundary of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| This include completing Marion Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| from Fifth Avenue to Barnard Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| and then creating a 10-foot greenway from Fifth Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| up to Baxter Avenue and other road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| The property has multiple potential access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| as it fronts on three streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| It is close to other commercial districts in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| The multi-use stadium is less than one mile to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| The former industrial site has brownfield status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Any new development would be required to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| with appropriate TDEC guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| during the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| This is essentially a down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| from the heavy industrial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| which is less likely to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| any negative environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| With all of this context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| staff recommends the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| of the CH-1 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| This would allow reusing this brownfield site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I don't think this case is loading on the website currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2025)|
| 0:33:56| Yeah, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| There's no staff recommendation on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| link to the, link to a staff recommendation on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And it's on the Google Drive you shared yesterday, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| It is, yeah, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Our website went down yesterday, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| It's a rare occurrence for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| So I know there's been some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| there might be some glitches as it gets back online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| I was gonna ask about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| it lists out community mixed use center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| light industrial, general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| office, and MDR, medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| And I know our sector plans are a little bit dated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| in terms of some of the terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| not always lining up perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| with what we adopted with recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| So are we interpreting just the general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| as falling within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| that CH, commercial highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| falls within general commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Yes, that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| As well as the MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| because it does allow residential development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Yeah, I've got some other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| that are more deliberation for Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| you know, how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| how many CH zonings have we seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| like rezone requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| sort of within the sort of central city sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| We don't see many of those, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Do we have any data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| We can look into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| but we don't have that readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2148)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Well, we'll move on to agenda item number 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| That would also be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| And this is my last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| You've given him all the challenging ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| So the request is for a third sign in the CG1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| The subject property is located at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| of Rutledge Pike and Timothy Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Kenzo Markets recently demolished their convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| and gas pump at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| and now they're planning to construct a new gas pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| and a new convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| This would also include a Hardee's restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| As part of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| the applicant would like to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| the two existing pole signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| the tall ones, the tall shell sign one, and this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and replace the third sign that you can see on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| with a new sign for Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| The CG1 district generally allows one detached sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| per street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| up to a maximum of two detached signs per parcel or lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Additional signs may be permitted in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| subject to approval by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| The CN1 zone under which the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| was initially developed also allowed a maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| of two signs with no provision for any exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Even though the number of signs was not in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| with the previous zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| a permit for a third sign was issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| for this property in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| and therefore the third sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| has always been a legal non-conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| Article 17.2.8 says that use of a non-conforming sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| may continue to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| except when the use of the property changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| In this case, since the old structure is demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| and there is going to be new business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| and change in use with the addition of restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| the three pole signs must be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| to the standard of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| And therefore the city's plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| and inspection department has determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| that the third sign requires planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| So the third sign will replace the sign we have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| It will be located in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| It's basically a sign for Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2313)|
| 0:38:44| Is this supposed to be in the same position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| that the current one is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| So the current one does not meet the setback requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| but the proposed one will meet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| So more context on that actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| So this tall sign is over height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| It does not meet the height requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| They pursued a BZA variance, which was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| So now they either have to remove it or change the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| The second one, initially it seemed to be non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| but then the applicant provided new survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| and it looks like that it is conforming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| based on the new survey provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| The third sign is also non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| but with the proposed replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| it would meet the setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| So it won't meet the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| but it is in the same position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| just it'll be closer to the building, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Yeah, it would have more setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| but it would be in the general same location of this sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| And then this will remain as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and the tall one either needs to be replaced or be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| Is the Hardee's, it's a separate building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| It's the same building, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Actually, that's one of our rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| for recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| So the zoning ordinance says that additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| may be approved if the sign is essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| due to multiple structures or uneasable topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| or building location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| So in this case, it's just one single structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| as you can see on this site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| And there are no topographical challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| or building location challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| And we think that the existing signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| can potentially be modified to include a signage for Hardee's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| The other consideration is that this needs to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| The surrounding property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| has multiple commercially zoned properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| even though only a few developed as commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| And no other property says more than two signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| In fact, from street view, from what I gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| no other properties has more than one signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| So both of the other two have to be modified, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| Neither of them are conforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| And so with the new use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| they're both going to have to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| Yes, the tall one needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| With the new survey, this middle shell one can remain as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| Even though it doesn't meet the setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| We initially thought that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| but then the applicant provided a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| to the Plans Review and Inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| and they confirmed that it now meets the setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| And I know you said that most don't have more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| Did I hear you say there is a limitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| to the number of signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Under the current ordinance, it's two per lot maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and Planning Commission may approve additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Under the previous zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| it was two maximum with no exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| but a third permit was still issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| And under this, where would the Hardee sign go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| C to replace this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| so next to their proposed driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| So at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2555)|
| 0:42:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| We will move on to agenda item number 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| wait, 63, 23, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| 6L24RZ, and this request has generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| a lot of public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| The applicant is requesting up to eight dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Turn it over to Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2582)|
| 0:43:10| Yes, so this is approximately a 50-acre property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| located at 11326 San Lee Road in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2594)|

| 0:43:21| The request is to rezone from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| to planned residential with a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| of up to eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| The rear line of this property abuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2608)|

| 0:43:32| middle school, and high school complex to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| San Lee Road is an 18-foot wide major collector street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| that connects to the minor arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2619)|

| 0:48:11| and roadway improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2891)|

| 0:48:49| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| What, I don't know if, Ms. Hillman, if you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| or maybe if engineering knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| so like the process of connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| to that school access road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| I know we've had pedestrian connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| to some school properties in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| but what's the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| because if this piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| connects to that school access road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| that's really where the sidewalk connectivity exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| to get to Steel Road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Without that, they'd have to go all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| around up on Sam Lee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Right, so there's only a minor gap of sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| along Steel here and then here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| But yes, you're right, that there is existing sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| right at the rear of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| and I'm not sure what that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| would look like about school access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Okay, because that would seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| to be a really good connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=2985)|

| 0:56:09| So there's two associated rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| One, the other rezoning is being postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3373)|

| 0:56:20| It's all on the same parcel, so I just wanna point that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| that there's a separate rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3382)|

| 0:56:33| And they're requesting CA zoning general business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Like I said, that'll be, it's being postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| to next month because it requires a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| They had to change their request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| from a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| to a plan amendment based on the new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| So the back, back to this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| they're requesting planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3411)|

| 0:57:25| So that kind of gives a little bit of an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| The intent there is to really try to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| disturbance within the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| of the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| But if there's, but it does give the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| of the Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| alternative land disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Real quickly, just wanted to read through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| the existing land use in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| See it's largely agricultural, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| There is some minor pockets of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| There are a lot of public, quasi-public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| which is the blue, and some industrial off to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Just reference, just in case you're not familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| with the site, this is down in the Seymour area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| so it's really close to Knox County border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| Zoning, again, so in the general areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| mainly agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| There is some strip zoning of CA along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| A lot of that is not used for commercial purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| Like a lot of our older commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| there's got the CA zoning or some commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| X feet off of the roadway, probably like 200 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| 300 feet, just kind of all up and down the stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| So you see a lot of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| but not a lot of it is used for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| The OB you see there is a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| and I think it's, well, it's a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| I think the church is in the agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| so the OB is a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| Just a quick overview of the site, the aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| You see it's largely vegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| And I just want to point out, so this is a different view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| It's kind of a changed view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Chapman Highway is on the lower side here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Just kind of show how steep this property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| and it's got this large ridge feature in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| But these two properties, I just want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| it's not part of this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| They are owned separately, so kind of a donut hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| in the middle of the property owned by Thunder Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| The comprehensive plan designation is primarily TN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| which is the traditional neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| It does have a little bit of town center mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| Or mixed town center mixed use in the western side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3575)|
| 0:59:42| of the corner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| As we discussed before, the traditional neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| land use recommends a mixture of use types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| primarily single family attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| Multi-family is a secondary use, and commercial is secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| It talks about being walkable in areas near other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| like parks and commercial establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| There is a park currently on this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| but in the CA portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| which is Bowers Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| But like I said, that property is under consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| for rezoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| There is a shopping center, a small shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| I do anticipate there was an expansion of CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| again, associated with the same property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| So I would anticipate further commercial sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| in the future, but it's not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| So getting to the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| of two dwellings per acre, this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| does have a lot of topography on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| Majority of the site is within the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| quite steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| As pointed out in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| so like I said, the site is about 103 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| 73, 79 acres is in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| There's another 6.2 acres in the stream protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| Of the acres in the hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| 31.9 acres is 25% to 40% slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| and 25.5 acres is 40% or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| So that's 72%, almost 73% of the hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| is over 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And that's about 44% of the entire site is over 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| So this was a big factor in staff's consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| for the density, as well as the condition to limit disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| and to require development plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| before grading permits are issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| before the site's cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| Just to give a couple ideas on sizes of area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| this is about 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| The hillside protection area, I'm sorry, the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| recommends about 22 acres of disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| within the HP area only, excluding areas like this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| here that's not within the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| So this is about 17 acres less than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| the hillside protection area would allow to be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| So the slope analysis would allow it to be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| And at first glance, that's like the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| that I would assume would be most prime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| for residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| I'm sure there's other little pockets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| but that's what I'm assuming would be most prime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3770)|
| 1:03:00| I'm going to say, with the two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| that's about 202 dwelling units based on the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| If you're familiar with Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| there's improvements going on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| and have been done in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| If you have any questions, I can answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| But the two other side streets that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| are both substandard, and if any significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| of additional trips go along those roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| I'm sure it will require improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3811)|
| 1:03:44| I'm sorry, what happened when they came before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| Where did it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| For this site or for the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| For this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| We never discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| They requested postponement before it even was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Before it came before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| OK, seeing no other questions, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| going to move on to agenda item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Staff is recommending postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| On this one, primarily due to an incomplete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| submittal, county commission, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| sure Mr. Reynolds will cover this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| but county commission did, as a condition of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| of the rezoning, require that a landscape plan be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| And the applicant would like to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| This is a request for 113 detached residential houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| This property was rezoned in March 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| It was previously zoned RAE, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| is an exclusive residential, planned residential, and planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| So it was approved for four dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| Just real quick, the 35-foot peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| has to be maintained along Briar Glen and Suburban Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| The applicant is not requesting peripheral setback reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| on any portion of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| so the 35-foot peripheral stain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| No stub-out connections to Briar Glen or Suburban Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| which is not happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| They are providing two stub-outs to different properties, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| happen to be owned by the same people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| they're purchasing this property from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| but not connecting to the adjacent subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Condition number three is regarding the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| screen required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| So basically, along the Briar Glen subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| which is to the south, an evergreen screen is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| You can read the condition you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| but it's basically one evergreen tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| every 12 feet along that southern boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| is what it falls down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| A traffic study is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| It has been submitted and reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| The entrance will be from Ebenezer Road, which it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| and they are to include a landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| That's the piece that we don't have yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| is the landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| Some other, so there's two alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| that they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Technically, there's more to it, but there's four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Two of them are for the Planning Commission approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| which is to increase the road grades of road B to 13.8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| and road C to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| So road B is this first road that comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| and then road C is this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| The next one, which is an increase of intersection grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| are both engineering related alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| in there to increase the intersection grade of both road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| B and C at road A to 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| With a 2% intersection grade, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| can still install ADA-compliant crosswalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| if sidewalks are installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| This plan does include a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| on the north side of road A to the intersection of road B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| and will also have a sidewalk along its own frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| of Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| That's per the Knox County sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Other road improvements, according to the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| is to lengthen the turn lane on Ebenezer Road at Kingston Pikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| This would be the right turn lane onto Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Kind of hard to see in this image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| but basically there's not a lot of space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| between Kingston Pike and the creek crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| here in this culvert bridge with this guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| So there's discussion of how best to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| They cannot install a turn lane per general engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| standards without really getting into the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| and extending the culvert and everything else, so the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| So the county is working with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| to find out what's the best solution there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| I think they kind of know what's the best solution there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| basically to stay out of the floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| try to keep everything on the north side of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| but that will be worked out in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| during the design plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| So we'll get an extension of the turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| but it may not be to the full engineering standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| that we would get, but it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| everybody's comfortable with where we're going to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| Other considerations, this is not shown on the plan either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| The two circled areas, staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| that instead of a temporary T turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| be provided at the ends of Road A and B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| that a cul-de-sac be provided, temporary cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| be provided, because we've seen that sometimes these roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| don't continue on, either ever or, for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| And having a T turnaround at the end of roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| with these many houses is not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| You think about all the delivery trucks and trash trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| and general vehicles that come down these roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| on a daily basis, weekly basis, a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| is definitely more ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| Unfortunately, the problem with the cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| it does have a 10% grade maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| Even though they're temporary, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| feel that they still should request a variance for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| to lower the, because right now, Road B has a 13 plus percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| grade, and then Road A has a 11.75% grade, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| So they're both above 10, and we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| the Planning Commission should approve a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| or to increase the maximum road grade of a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| from 10% to whatever the road grade is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Their intent is, obviously, for that road to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| We want to make sure that that's still feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| We don't want to make it more challenging by requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| that lower 10% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Other two items, there's two roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| in the Briar Glen subdivision that basically extend out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| into the subject site just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| The one on the east side actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| has a small little turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| We're asking that they provide a little bit of right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| around these road stubs, just to get the public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| into the right-of-way as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| On this eastern one, we need enough right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| so that the county can put a second leg on that T turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| to make that function better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| So in that case, we're just asking for the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| and the county will construct the extra leg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| of that turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| On the other one, it's just really providing the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| Existing land use, if you care to look into this in more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| detail, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Zoning on the property is pretty consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| with surrounding developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| And the place type on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| I just want to point this out real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| So during the rezoning phase, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| this was before the comprehensive plan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| The whole site where the plan for this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| was changed to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| That all happened really close to the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| that the comprehensive plan was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| and did what was planned commercial zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| and I think have the office land use on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| Got flipped to the business park land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| but the whole change of sector plan to comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| just didn't transition properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| So this will be cleaned up soon as a staff process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| But I just wanted to let you know that when I reviewed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I really reviewed it under the suburban residential SR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| land use for the entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| So even though the BP business parks land use or place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| does allow consideration of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| so in reality it's not out of compliance with that place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| type either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| So the suburban residential, the primary use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| is single family, which is being proposed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| with lots smaller than one acre, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| is being proposed, there's really not too much out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| of line with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Does talk about being within close proximity to service uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| and being along arterials for larger, or collectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| for larger subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| As we've already discussed, the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| is to postpone until July because of the lack of meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| all the conditions of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Hey Mike, just so I'm clear, was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| some sort of communication breakdown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| in the preliminary meeting between you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| guys and the applicant about the need for the landscaping plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| Or was it part of the comments that you would generally get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| Or did they think it would be a staff approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| prior to the development plan or the design plan being approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| Do you know what the issue was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| It was part of the staff comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4426)|
| 1:13:54| When I gave staff comments originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| I asked for a landscape plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| was done by a professional landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Further discussions with the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| we decided that it probably wasn't necessary based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| on the explicitness of the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| but we still needed a landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| So we kind of left it up to them to get it submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Just a follow up on that, too, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Because I think you said that on the plan on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| in that 35 foot setback, you're requiring trees every 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| Or is that a class A, B, or C buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| It's closer to class B, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| It doesn't require the staggered trees like a class A would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| I guess that's why I mean to dovetail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| I mean, if we're requiring that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| and it's already defined, why do we need a landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| plan along with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Because it was a condition of approval by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| It's not our requirement that we put on the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| It's that it was a condition of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| And county commission added the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| that it cannot connect to the adjacent subdivisions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| But my question is, if they just say that class B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| buffers are submittal to the landscaping plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| what else would they have to provide from a supplement standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| I guess, was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| I'd say a lot of it has to do with the comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| level of the adjacent property owners knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| what's going to be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Some people are very visual, and they want to see it on plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| I'm not sure if that was the intent of the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| for landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| But I know if I was an adjacent property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| I would like to see what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Even if it is a pretty simple plan, I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| But obviously, staff would not ask for anything more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| than the class B buffer that's spelled out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| in the ordinance or the subregs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| In this kind of condition, I mean, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| rarely would we require a type A landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| screening between two residential detached subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| And also, we would defer to Knox County engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4575)|
| 1:16:22| and to Mr. Elliott's team in terms of making sure that that can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| because they would be the ones that would need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| that that condition was actually met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4588)|
| 1:16:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| We'll move on to, I want to try to get us out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| We have nine more minutes left before 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| We'll try to get you all out at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| And we have two more agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Item number 36 and 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Yeah, I'll make 36 pretty quick in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| So you may be familiar with the Lantern Park subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| on Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| It's closer to the western edge of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| before it turns into Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| It's been through this board or commission two times prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| for concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| There was one in 2021 for 18 lots, another in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| For 26, that was ultimately withdrawn in December 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| The property was, the main portion of the subdivision was platted this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| with, I assume it was 18 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| They're coming back with a request for seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| So 18 lots plus seven lots in this phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| which give them a total of 25 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| The gross density of the site would then be 2.82 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| The property is zoned planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| but three dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| As part of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| they're also modifying the original stormwater plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| So basically, I'll show this in more detail in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| but there was two ponds anticipated for Lantern Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| One, both of them kind of flanked Lantern Park Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| which is the main road coming into Lantern Park subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| one towards the front at Hardin Valley and one towards the back at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| They're proposing to remove the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| or I guess combine the two detention ponds into one along Mission Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Lane towards the northeast part of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| The property at the front of Lantern Park near Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| they're proposing two lots there and then five lots along Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| The Mission Hill Lane lots will have access directly from Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4733)|
| 1:19:01| The other two will have access from their internal road, Lantern Park Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| This is just showing what the phase one was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| It was platted previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| The detention pond in front, detention pond in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| You see in this aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| so that's where the house is currently being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| The new detention pond is back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| We can go through the place type if you care to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| but it's suburban mixed residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| It does allow a substantial amount of density within the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| and I don't really have anything too much to note other than single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| is permissible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| We'll talk about connections for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| multi-modal sidewalk is being proposed on Mission Hill Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| and there is a sidewalk to Lantern Park Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| So the staff recommendation is to approve subject to conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| and then I just wanted to make one note condition as to move mail kiosks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| that are located on Mission Hill Lane to Lantern Park Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| It's kind of a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| We're recommending such a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| but I feel like this is more appropriate along their own subdivision lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4818)|
| 1:20:24| than along the external part of their development on Mission Hill Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| If anybody has any questions, I'd be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| Yeah, hey, Mike, did you consider much about the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| the steep slopes on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| I'm just worried about the density with that disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Well, I'd say there's really not much undisturbed at this point, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| so there's not much we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| In the, because we're talking about the part in blue and green, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| Yeah, so this is the part that's being considered right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| Right, but it looks like there's pretty steep slopes in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| and there was a .54 is the recommended disturbance within that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| So what you're seeing here in these topography lines exist today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| or I imagine they exist today as shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| The property's already been graded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| so there's really nothing to change at this point with the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| It already has been graded, is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| So the diagram in the packet is not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| Yeah, the hillside protection, the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| that was done after the slope analysis was graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| Or the topography that we have in our own system, in our GIS system is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4908)|
| 1:21:59| Just for semantics and just to put it on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| why is this having to come back before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| Did I miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Well, the main, so the only part of this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| that is technically approved for a concept plan right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| is the 18 lots that surround Lantern Park Lane right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| So the five lots along Mission Hill Lane are new to the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| but also a modification of the stormwater plan is a new change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| And that's really, a five-lot subdivision by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| does not require concept plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| but we've had some issues in the past with a change to stormwater plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| that have been pretty significant problems for adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| So we don't want to make too big of a change to a stormwater plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| post-concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4971)|
| 1:23:00| There were some comments about Chancery Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| that this property, that the plan had gone before Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| Is this prior to the development, the first phase development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| That was part of the 2022 concept plan that was ultimately withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| It went to court, came back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| was withdrawn by the applicant at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| So they basically reverted back to the 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| So nothing that's being recommended, or none of this concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| has anything to do with what was originally decided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| In 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| It's similar in design, yes, but it's not related to the 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| That concept plan was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| Okay, any other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| So we have one more agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Like I said, I want to be respectful of everybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| This is a similar use determination for off-road riding, motorized vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| mountain bikes, and the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Do you all want to discuss that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Do you want to stay a couple extra minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| Yes, it actually came before you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| and then it was postponed for staff to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| So that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| I will say I haven't talked to the applicant about the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| recommendations points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| So they may not 100% agree with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| We'll find out on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| But the gist of it is that we are recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| We kind of looked at it a little bit different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| as in like what kind of provisions do other uses that are uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| permitted in the ag zone require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| and how could those be kind of pieced together to create some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| framework for this type of use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| So really some very basic criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5109)|
| 1:25:19| And I'll be happy to go over any of them if anybody wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| but that's how I got to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| I guess we will remain adjourned until Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| and then just obviously making sure everybody shows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| because we've got a tight quorum on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| So don't forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-240611?start=5134)|
