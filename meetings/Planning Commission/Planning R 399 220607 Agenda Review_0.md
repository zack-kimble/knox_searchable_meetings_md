| 0:00:29| Welcome everyone to the June meeting of the Knox, Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| Agenda Review meeting. Looks like we've got a full contingent of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| Good. This time I'll turn the meeting over to Director Brooks and she'll make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| some introductions and go start going through the agenda. Thank you Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:54| Phillips. I'd like to give a couple updates regarding our staff. Many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:01:00| know Sherry McKenzie. I believe I saw her walk in earlier. So Sherry has for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=60)|
| 0:01:09| many years been the first person that you see if you were to come into her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| office and she recently celebrated 34 years with us at the end of May and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| will be retiring in a couple of weeks. She's been with planning long enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| have lost track of the number of co-workers and customers she's come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| across and to have seen many incredible changes to our processes and technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| that we use over the years. She knows the city county building like the back of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| her hand and can direct even the most adrift of customers to the office that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| they need. She also knows her co-workers really well. She's always checking in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| us and our families and asking about our children, keeping track of ages and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| milestones and other important things that keep us going outside of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| Her knowledge of our agency, our customers, our agency history is hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| be and she is going to be missed tremendously. So I would like for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| to please join me in thanking Sherry. Sherry please stand up for her many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| of service to this community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=130)|
| 0:02:22| Okay so we have a new summer intern that has joined us. Ben, he's sitting over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| next to Liz, will be here for the summer. He's one of the summer in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| interns. It's a partnership that we participate in with the city and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| we're very excited that he's here. He's a rising senior at the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Iowa and he's studying economics and is interested in going to grad school for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| planning. Is that right? Oh excellent, we like to hear that. So we also have, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| of you know, that one of our administrative assistants left about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| month ago and so we have a new administrative assistant that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| joining us on June 20th and we will introduce you to her. I'm sure she will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| be training closely with Dory over the next several months. Okay, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| Advanced Knox. So in front of you, you have a copy of the state of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| report for the Advanced Knox project that was recently released. You also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| should have received an electronic link to that. I hope you all have had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| to look at it or we'll reference it and review it over the next month or so. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| report is an overview of the county's current land-use patterns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| transportation systems and the infrastructure that connects them. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| assesses the conditions and trends that affect how Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| live, work, and travel. And now that the report is complete, the project team has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| begun working on scenario planning by analyzing data to help illustrate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| possible strategies that the county might want to use to guide future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| So we're really excited about this next step in the process and we'll keep you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| all updated as we move forward. So now I'd like to introduce Lindsey Crockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| Some of you might remember, I know that Lindsey doesn't typically come to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| meetings, but she's one of our senior staff members. She staffs the Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| Zoning Commission as well as the Design Review Board and she assists in a range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| of other reviews, primarily within the city of Knoxville. So I'm going to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| over to Lindsey and she's going to provide an update on historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| preservation activities within the city of Knoxville over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=272)|
| 0:04:52| Okay, so the city charter requires a report on the state of historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| preservation within the city of Knoxville to be submitted to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| Planning Commission and the mayor. So this is a summary of that report. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| covers two years of preservation activities within the city, 2020 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| 2021. So the annual report typically begins with a discussion of progress on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| preservation initiatives that have been identified in the past years. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| first one I'll touch on relates to a potential new overlay in the Oakwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| neighborhood. The Oakwood, sort of the Oakwood half of Oakwood-Lincoln Park in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| North Knoxville, it was pursuing a historic or neighborhood conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| overlay for several years and one product of that effort that came out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| 2020 was the overlay report that was produced in summer 2020. It's a summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| of the research, the public outreach, and the preservation planning efforts in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| neighborhood. The report summarizes an extensive architectural survey that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| completed in 2019 and it ultimately recommends a neighborhood conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| overlay for Oakwood, which would serve as an incremental approach to preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| It would have less restrictive guidelines than a historic overlay, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| is what the neighborhood was initially driving towards. The neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| conservation doesn't review basic exterior rehabilitation, so we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| that this would be a transition towards a historic overlay. So at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| that's kind of where that overlay is. It's the ball sort of in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| neighborhood's court to initiate further action on that one. Another major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| preservation initiative from 2020 relates to Section 106 review. That's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| federal regulation where local agencies that use federal funding have to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| into account any effect that the project might have on historic properties. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| this is a consultative process between the State Historic Preservation Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| I'll refer to that as the SHPO, the agencies that are receiving federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| funding, and then it must be completed for each property over 45 years old. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| if you can imagine, that's quite a lot within the city of Knoxville. The city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| Office of Housing and Neighborhood Development uses HUD funding to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| hundreds of small rehabilitation projects per year. These are projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| like HVAC replacements, water heater repairs, roof replacements, accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| modifications, and due to the nature of the city's housing stock, many of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| houses are over 45 years old. So as you can imagine, the time that's involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| submitting individual requests over and over to the SHPO could cause major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| delays in these really necessary projects. So in early 2020, planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| staff coordinated a programmatic agreement between the city, the SHPO, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| then a federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| PA streamlines the review process, so it delegates most of those reviews to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Historic Preservation Planner. Those projects can be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| exempt and move forward without further SHPO review. So the chart that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| on the screen, that counts the total reviews, and you can see more than half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| can be determined exempt. These are really simple projects like roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| replacements, again, accessibility modifications. The non-exempt projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| tend to be broader scopes of work, usually lead-based paint remediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| elements that might have some effect on the historic property. Planning also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| provides support for the City Historic Preservation Fund and the City Facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Improvement Grants. So the Historic Preservation Fund is typically funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| between $300,000 and $500,000, and that is significantly more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:30| than the state's Preservation Grant Fund. For comparison, usually the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| receives around $250,000 annually and has to spread that out through projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| throughout the state. So for this, staff tends to assist in evaluating properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| eligibility for the grant, reviewing grant applications, and then on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| back-end offering technical assistance or completing the design review for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| ongoing projects. There was a pause in funding for 2020 and 2021 due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| pandemic, but the grant was funded in 2022 and there are several projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| that are getting underway. So the meat of the City's Historic Preservation work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| is the work of the Historic Zoning Commission. That is a nine-member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| commission appointed by the City Mayor. So on the left you can see a chart of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| the Certificates of Appropriateness issued in the various Historic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| Neighborhood Conservation overlays over 2020 and 2021, and then on the right you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| can see a breakdown of the types of work. So Level 1 projects, which are at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| are typically minor projects involving repair or replacement in kind. Those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| administrative approvals, and then the other three levels go to the Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Zoning Commission. Level 3 is new construction, and then Level 4 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| demolition. One other element that the Historic Zoning Commission completes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| these pre-application workshops that we encourage applicants proposing major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| projects, new construction, etc. to complete with the Commission. So these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| are an informal opportunity for the applicants to gather input from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| Commissioners on the front end before submitting a formal application, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| had 14 of those over the last two years. In the last two years, I would say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| Historic Zoning Commission experienced the same development pressures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| challenges that the Planning Commission has reviewed. Obviously it's on a somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=615)|

| 0:10:29| potential to transform some really significant intersections and corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| in the city. For example, on the left side you can see a site at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| intersection of 17th and Forest Avenue in Fort Sanders. This used to hold a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| wash and a billboard, and soon it will be a new residential duplex, and the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| of that was really guided and shepherded by the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| design review. We also saw many new secondary structures. Folks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=653)|

| 0:11:03| the central city, and you can see one in the middle. I think that was built in Old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| North Knoxville. And then there are also some substantial exterior rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| projects. So at this point, these are really almost outlier houses that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| been deteriorating or vacant for a really long time in neighborhoods which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| are now a lot more desirable to live in. And so it's kind of a process of filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| in the gaps, and we've seen a lot of major exterior rehab projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| The annual report also highlights a bunch of properties which are either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| success stories or opportunities for improvement, and I'm just going to touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| on a couple. Here's South High School. So this is a real, like, completion success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| for 2020. This property was acquired by the city through our demolition by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=703)|

| 0:11:55| very extensive rehabilitation. I'm sure some of y'all have visited this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| by this time, but there are completed photos on the screen now. It was opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| as an assisted living center in July 2020. This is a 1937 Charles Barber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| design, and it's protected by a local historic overlay as well. This is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| unique project. So this is a mid-century automobile showroom that's located on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Old Broadway. Typically your eye would have just gone right over it, but it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| originally the Fountain City branch of the Hull Dobbs Ford dealership. It was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| use until around 2016, but it was substantially deteriorated. It had a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| of non-historic alterations. You can see the shingles covering up the facade here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| and all sorts of materials on the side elevation there. In 2020, a new owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| purchased it, and they placed a landmark historic overlay on the property in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| January. This allowed them to preserve the building and then complete a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| substantial adaptive reuse without making some very costly floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| related updates. So the photo on the right shows the new design. They drew on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| historic photographs of the building to restore original historic features, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| now it's in use as a small event center. So that's a real success. The final sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| of aspect of preservation that I'll highlight is the infill housing overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| and this will provide some context for the Commission for a zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| amendment that we'll discuss shortly. The infill housing overlay is a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| overlay that was established in 2005 and 2007. The intent is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| protect the existing neighborhood character of the three neighborhoods you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| see on your screen, so Lonsdale, Oakwood Lincoln Park, and Edgewood Park. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| examples of Knoxville's older neighborhoods which may not be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| for or even interested in a historic or a neighborhood conservation overlay, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| they do demonstrate consistent housing patterns, lot sizes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| streetscapes, and then they also have a lot of vacant lots. So in 2020, the infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| review moved from a staff-based committee to the design review board, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| in the same year and then in 2021, new construction on these vacant lots just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| exploded. So the DRB reviewed 33 new houses in these overlays in 2021 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| then 26 additional cases. The infill housing overlay is unique, I think, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| state of Tennessee, and I think it's a really good example of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| commitment to supporting historic neighborhoods even on a smaller scale. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| finally, the annual report provides action items for the next year, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| one I'll highlight is an update of the design guidelines for the Edgewood Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| City historic overlay. This is just the existing overlay, we're not speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| about an expansion of the overlay at this time, but as a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| expansion effort, the neighborhood put, you know, years of effort into new design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| guidelines, and so we're trying to get those adopted. We actually held a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| meeting last night, and on your screen you can see there's a website, a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| web page that you can access on Planning's website, which has a summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| of efforts that have been done in the past, the draft guidelines, a forum for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| comments, and so we hope to take these to the Historic Zoning Commission and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| City Council in the fall. In general, the full annual report was emailed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=914)|
| 0:15:22| Planning Commission, I believe last month, and it's available on our website, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| I'm happy to answer any questions you all might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:36| Thank you, Lindsay. We can move on to that first item, number 42. Okay, so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=936)|
| 0:15:51| agenda item number 42. This is an amendment to the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| Zoning Code Article 16.6.E, so that's the infill housing overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| district review. So that map is up there on the screen as a reminder. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| the neighborhoods that are currently covered by the infill housing overlay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| currently the code for the infill overlay doesn't have a process for level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| one approvals. All projects in the purview of the overlay go to the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| review board at a monthly public meeting, and those are listed on your screen. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| in the infill overlay, we review new primary structures, additions visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| from the primary street, changes to porches visible from the primary street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| driveways, parking pads, and secondary structures, and then subdivision plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| Other zoning overlays, like the historic overlay, which I just discussed, those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| subject to historic zoning review, and then downtown Knoxville properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| are reviewed by the DRB. They have existing procedures for staff level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| approvals, so those codes are actually linked in your case file if you'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| to read those. But level one staff level approvals are contingent on the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| project meeting the design guidelines, and then there are guardrails that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| present for both of those. So the applicant or staff can always request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| that the project be reviewed by the full board. If there's a question, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| project meets the design guidelines or not, you know, staff's position is always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| to put it in front of the board or the Commission, and then if the COA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| is denied by staff, the applicant could appeal a staff decision to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| design review board. So there's the text on your screen. The proposed level one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| projects, provided that the work meets the design guidelines, are subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| plots, new accessory structures, new driveways, parking pads, and access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| modifications to existing parking pads, revisions to level one COAs, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| minor modifications to existing porches. These reflect the level one projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| that are already listed on our adopted fee schedule, and then these will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| presented in a report to the DRB at the regular monthly meeting. Allowing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| these approvals will really expedite the review process for contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| developers, and property owners, and it will reduce burdens on staff time. So for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| example, in 2021 there were a total of 59 cases in the infill housing overlay. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| 59 of those had to go to the design review board, and at least 21 of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| could have been approved administratively. The design review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| board has reviewed and approved this proposed code amendment at the May 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| meeting, so the staff recommendation would be to recommend approval of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| amendment to Article 16.6.E. Thank you, Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| When you get staff approval on a level one, does that allow the applicant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:44| start getting their permits faster and not have to wait for the meeting? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| The certificates of appropriateness would be issued and then they could move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| towards permitting. Thank you, Lindsay. If it is okay with the Commission, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:19:07| like to move up the discussion of item number 51, and then we'll pick back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| with item 41 with all the rest of the City of Knoxville zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| amendments. Any objections to that? Thank you. Michelle is going to pull up a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| slides. This is all within your packet of information, but I wanted to put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| up on the screen. I'm just going to walk you through exactly what is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| requested as part of this. This is a request from County Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Planning Commission to weigh in on these two proposed ordinance amendments they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| would like for you all to review, and it'll go back to them next month. So, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| first amendment is to provide for use on review appeals to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Court of Competent Jurisdiction. This is an amendment to Knox County's zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| ordinance section 6.5007 and then 6.6003. And then, as they currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| are, uses on review may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| second amendment would be to repeal in their entirety subsections 6.40.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| 6.40.02, and then 6.40.03. Within the code, there is a grant of authority for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1220)|

| 0:20:31| So, those are the two code sections that they're asking for you to review. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| go to the next slide, Michelle. And Law Director Book is present here, but these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| I just wanted to highlight a few items that were in the Law Director's Analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| which is Exhibit 2 in your packet. So, I think there has been, based on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| analysis, a completion of terms. The use on review and development plan within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| the code. As you all know, the code is very old and dated and hasn't had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| comprehensive update, maybe ever, since it was originally created. BZA is reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| use on reviews and development plans, but the BZA does not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| authority to review development plans. And I won't read you everything on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1276)|

| 0:21:28| 13.7109. This is the title, the section of the code that sets forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1288)|
| 0:21:36| the powers granted to the Board of Zoning Appeals. And those three are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| summarized here. It's just an abbreviated version. You have a link to the full text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1300)|

| 0:21:57| just wanted to lay that out for you all. These are the items for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1317)|

| 0:22:08| Law Director Boock as well. Can you go back to the first slide? So, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:23| Amendment 2, that's not counting, like, County Commission's approval of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| rezonings, additionally, right? That's separate. That's in a separate statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| That's correct. So, Amy, the way I'm understanding this is really semantics on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:43| our part between a use-owner review and a concept plan. Sure. Usually, I talk so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| loud, you can hear me anyway. So, what we're really looking at here is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| difference between a use-owner review and a concept plan, in effect, right, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| PR zone. Is that right, what we're saying? And the way I'm understanding what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| county's position is, is that BZA has the authority to do the zoning, but not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| concept plan. The use-owner review, yes. Yeah, not the use-owner review, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| concept, but not the concept plan, but a use-owner review. Concept plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| appealed to the court. Can we fix this by taking the use-owner review wording out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| of the code? I mean, out of our PR description? Potentially. Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1410)|
| 0:23:38| Boock, did you want to speak to this? I don't want to speak on behalf of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| analysis. We haven't actually done our own, we haven't actually reviewed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| ourselves. That is correct. Mike Moyers, excuse me, is the one that worked on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:52| former law director, former Chancellor Mike Moyers. He drafted this at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| request of the mayor. The mayor is the one that requested this before commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| and commissioned quite properly, and as is required, sends this on to MPC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| their review, your review and recommendation, back to county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| commission. They will then vote on it. I hadn't thought of it in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| you said, if you took that out. The bottom line is it's vague right now. The item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| number three on there is the only way that it can be interpreted that a BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| can review, excuse me, a use-on review from this body. Generally, county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| commission, from having sitting there for the last eight years and as requested by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| the mayor, is that county commission has the expertise on use-on review, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| you've got standards you've got to follow, and to take that and go back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| front of the BZA is a slowing down of the process and getting permits, assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| that this body says that a particular use-on review is allowed. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| expertise that the mayor says we rely on the board, on the MPC, I keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| calling the MPC, I can't help that for all these years, and so he's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| wanting to take that out. The other thing that came up when Mike Moyers was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| looking at this was that the BZA has been hearing these concept plans. Clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| there's no authority for BZA to hear concept plans, so what he has done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| drafting this at the request of the mayor does two things. As Amy pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| it takes care of the problem of the BZA, the ambiguity of the BZA hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| concept plans, and also takes out this item on the BZA hearing what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| decided your body on a use-on review, and I think Mr. Snowden had represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| to Commission that since 2008 there had only been, I think he said, and he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| correct me, 19 appeals to the BZA since 2008 on a use-on review. Six of those had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| withdrawn, so bottom line is, and I stand corrected, Mr. Snowden, was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| there were 13 of them over the past 12 years is all that has come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Commission. I'm not sure that answered your question because I didn't look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| it from looking at it from from the perspective of yours. Am I correct, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| Snowden, or close to being correct? That is correct, and one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| that the mayor also talked about was in that period of 15 years since 2008, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| ones that have been heard as it relates to use-on review, over close to half of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| those have occurred in the last two years, so the trend is that that body is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| becoming more active in the use-on review appeals, and the mayor felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| that that was something that was unnecessarily slowing the process down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:17| I'm not here to advocate one way or the other. I simply was asked by Amy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| Tasha to come here and answer any questions you might have. Alternatively, to get rid of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| ambiguity of whether BZA can hear a development plan, the code could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| just be modified to add that word in as something that could hear then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| I think you might have trouble getting Commission to say that that's my gut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| reaction just sitting there. Yeah, if you amended it and said, yeah, you can hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| concept plans, and that would fall under the third item on the other slide. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:28:03| answer to your question would be yes, if they modified it that way, but that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| before Commission at this point. I have a question. It's really two separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:16| issues. There's the blurring of the concept plan in use-on-review, issue one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:24| and then issue two, the proposal being to bypass BZA and go directly to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| Chancery court for appeals, correct? That's correct. And so this body, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| considering these two separate issues, can respond to those in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1718)|
| 0:28:47| Yeah, on your recommendation and report to Commission, you can say whatever you decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| you're going to say. Presently, concept plans are not reviewable by BZA, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| the BZA has, as pointed out in that slide, it's been conflated, and that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| done. So to answer your question, if you don't have that in there, technically you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| can't do it. But what has been done in this, what Mr. Moyers has done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| drafting this ordinance at the request of the mayor, is to simply take that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| That clears up the ambiguity and vagueness that arises with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| concept plans and does away with the appeal from, of a use-on-review. But they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| are two separate issues. So the proposal is sort of meshing them together, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| they're actually separate. The conflation... Meaning that there is a terminology of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| use-on-review and concept plan which are needing to be clarified, and a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| issue of use-on-review only. Correct. Will that be heard by BZA or will that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| heard by a Chancery court? That's correct. And I would point out that the issue goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Chancery court on what they call a certiorari is, did the body, did this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| if it goes straight out of this body, did this body have sufficient information to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| make the decision, or was the decision arbitrary and capricious or illegal? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| it's a very strong thing to have to overcome, and even if you do a BZA, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| appeal out of BZA goes to... Where does it go? It goes to Chancery court. And what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| the Chancery court going to look at? It's going to look at, well, what did the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| have in front of it? And one of the things the BZA had in front of it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| the expertise of the Planning Commission. So if a judge is going to say, okay, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| you had all this information in front of you, and the expert body, the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| Commission said, okay, this use on review should be approved, that's what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| to happen anyway. Is that making any sense? Okay, good. I think what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| dealing with, most of the projects that we have come in on the planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| district are basically subdivisions. Ward of Zoning Appeals does not have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| authority over subdivision approval process. So I think we can make this a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| lot simpler in terms of amending the ordinance, and just amend the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1887)|
| 0:31:36| Actually, the PR zone, in my opinion, needs to be totally amended, more than just this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| item. But I do agree that we need to clarify that, because going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| BZA is not the appropriate procedure for concept plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1910)|

| 0:32:00| I was just going to give a real-world, recent account of this process, and I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| subdivision that was approved and was appealed to BZA a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1925)|

| 0:32:23| nothing, and then now we're in, now we were taken to court. So, you know, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| end up in court and figure it all out, but it was kind of, I don't want to say it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1949)|

| 0:32:42| Planning Commission meetings. Does BZA have to have a hardship to hear an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| appeal? Okay, so it can just be based off of just an appeal in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=1971)|

| 0:33:33| on something, if someone disagrees with it, they can take it to BZA as an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| and BZA can reinterpret or come up with a different best path forward, but BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:49| isn't really set up for making determinations on those topics. BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| is more based off of hardships related to the zoning code. Generally, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| Generally, it's the, she's got it up here, the special exceptions thing, and within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2042)|

| 0:34:16| really comes down. It's the first part of the three-part section in the state code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| for an administrative official. Let's take, for example, the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| person says, I'm not going to give you a permit to go ahead and start building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| and the developer or the builder says, well, why not? And then guy says, I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| not going to do it. So he can take that to BZA and let BZA determine as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| quasi-judicial body whether he improperly withheld the permit, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| that's the main purpose of the BZA, and the other is hardships, as you point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| out. That's a very big thing. The building inspector says, no, I'm not going to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| you that because your lot's too small or something, and then there's a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| because of the way it's laid out, and that goes to BZA. And that seems like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| both of those seem like very different situations than what we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| here, where we have a body of over a dozen members looking at all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| information and making a decision, and then a body of eight members looking, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2122)|

| 0:35:31| information, but then it's the same information, yes, okay, and then making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2131)|

| 0:35:42| with your real-world example there, let's say BZA had voted the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| then would you guys have been taking it to court? So, really it's going to end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| in court either way. I mean, in my case it did. That's an excellent point. If the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:36:06| developer or the builder gets turned down by BZA on a use-on-review, he's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| a lot at stake, he's going to go on to take it. I think that's what you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| saying, so that's true. It just seems like it's going to end up in court either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| and it's a way to speed up the process if you can bypass the BZA. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| That's part of the mayor's argument. I guess the counter to that would be if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| and I don't know the circumstances of Commissioner Smith's case, but for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2191)|

| 0:36:51| to them and can provide an opportunity to hear that case in a different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| rather than upping the ante and going directly to court, which might be out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2216)|

| 0:37:06| One other question I have. We're talking about concept plans. I'm sorry, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| As it relates to the PR zone, development of a subdivision that is zoned PR three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2232)|

| 0:37:36| The way I see it is you've got certain uses you can do, okay? You can put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| subdivision in with so many per acre. The use on review is based on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| itemized things within the code. They're very limited. You can put a junkyard in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:58| this zone, or you can put this on a review, a use on review. I think they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| two different things. Amy, do you have an opinion on that? Is that appropriate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| PR to consider a subdivision as a use on review? In the code, it specifically says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| that under 5.1302 permitted uses, the following dwelling units are permitted. Housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| attached houses, duplexes, multi-dwelling structures and developments, accessory uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| and it goes on. Then there's another section. Specifically, it's 5.1303,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| talking about uses permitted on review. There's a number of uses listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| I think what the law director's office has pointed out in their memo is there is language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| in this section that probably over time hasn't been properly updated. It's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| confused, the use on review and development plan. A development plan really is the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| itself. My opinion is, as I've stated previously, is that the plan residential zone needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| updated, but there's probably a whole comprehensive overview. I've just completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:10| redo it, but there is possibly some tweaks that we could make to make that language clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:19| I've got another question. I know a lot of things that we vote on then go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| county commission. These items do not. Is that correct? They don't go to county commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| additional vote or a reading? No, if it goes to BZA, then it comes out of BZA and goes to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| So is there a reason why if a community or somebody wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| appeal this, is there a way that they could go through county commission to voice their concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:57| No, it would be strictly right now the way it is in front of the BZA, but there's also a standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| issue that came in, I think in the latest appeal to BZA, and there was a standing issue that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2404)|
| 0:40:13| whole county doesn't have standing to come in and question the use on review. You've got to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| some interest, like you're a neighbor or something like that, and that was what was ruled on by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| BZA, I think, at the most recent meeting of the BZA. So it's not just, as somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| the community as a whole can't come in and doesn't have standing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| contest a use on review before BZA or in court for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| Okay, so I want to go back for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Who, I guess I'm looking for the answer to this question, who at BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:41:00| interpreted the state law to say that the county ordinance allowed them to take on this responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:10| I mean, they've got to have legal counsel that would have said you're not authorized to do this, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| They ruled on that at the last one as a body. They made that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| So they're just making up their own determination of what they can and can't review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| No, I think Mike Moyers was at that meeting, and I think he was giving them law on standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| No, no, I'm sorry. Why are some of these things that BZA should not be reviewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| why are they reviewing them? Where did they get, where did somebody interpret that they could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| If I may, what Director Brooks had mentioned earlier, if you look at in the zoning code 5.13.15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2506)|

| 0:42:30| shall be accompanied by the following information. In my opinion, that is the reason that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| planning staff has been reviewing these as a use permitted on review versus a traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:44| subdivision. So I think just by eliminating that one sentence can clarify, and they can even put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| in there, it's being submitted as a subdivision concept, which we approve all the time on any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| other development. Okay, and again, that's where I think I'm wanting to get to, because again, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| general public, they're going to hear there's a lot of things going on. I really want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| that's expressly clear on Thursday when we go through this discussion, just so that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| get down to the nuts and bolts of the why versus allowing narratives to run rampant in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| based on people's interpretation of what everybody's trying to do. So yeah, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| concern has been are we eliminating use on review to go through the BVA, and that is not the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:34| it's just for the PR projects, correct? Well, we used both terminologies here. We used the use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| review terminology, and then we used the development plan terminology in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| paragraph, basically, in our code. I think that's where people are getting confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:56| because the truth is, the reality is it's not a use on review, it's a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| it's a development plan. But the way it's written in the zoning, it refers to it as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| which probably shouldn't have been done that way, but it is, and I assume that's why staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| reviewing it under that provision. So your options are, as with all applications, and you have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| of zoning ordinance amendments in front of you on this agenda, is to approve, you can deny them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| you can amend them, or you can send them forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| So just keep that in mind as you prepare for Thursday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| Okay, let's go to item number 41. I do not have any slides for these next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| So the next amendments, these are all for the city's zoning ordinance. I would refer to them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| mainly cleanup amendments to our relatively new code. The first one is, staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| the addition of townhouse dwelling type to be permitted in the industrial mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| zoning district. There are a wide range of dwelling types that are allowed in this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| such as multifamily, single-family, two-family. Staff is of the opinion that this is simply an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| oversight, that townhouse was not included in this zone. And so we are proposing to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| the use table specifically to IMU. Does anybody have any questions about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| Amy, will these be on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Amy, will these be on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| It depends. I mean, it depends on, if we receive comments about them, then no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| If you all have objections to them, no. But I feel the reason that these are all on here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| because the zoning ordinance are important, and the amendments are, and so we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| that we review them, even if briefly. So the second one is number 43, 6C-22-0A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2759)|
| 0:46:10| Again, this is another amendment to the use matrix, Article 9.2, to add cultural facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| as a special use in the single-family, general, residential, and multifamily zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| in the city. There are a number of existing uses that would fall under this category of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| cultural facility. Types of uses that might fall under here are museums, cultural or historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| centers, non-commercial galleries, historic societies, and libraries. Existing cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| facilities such as Knox Heritage and the Beck Cultural Center, as well as house museums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| Mabry-Hazen, Crescent Bend, and the Bleak House are all located in the RN-1 zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| and although considered legal uses that they may continue to operate, they are not considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| conforming to the zoning district in which they are located. So if they have any need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| alter or expand the use, they have to go before the city's Board of Zoning Appeals, who must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| review and approve their proposal before a building permit can be issued. And so we are proposing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| cultural facilities be added as a special use in these residential zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| Does anybody have any questions? Amy, would they be, so most of these cases they use like existing houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:25| Yes. Would this be a case where they could go in and remove a house and build up a museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| without approval, or would that come back? No, they'd have to come back before the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| Commission. If they were to modify the existing house, or either way? Either way, yeah, it has to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| as a special use. It will be a use on review in the county. Is that what the equivalent is? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:50| Yeah, okay. So there'll be a public process associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| So the next seven code amendments were introduced by Plans Review and Inspection, so we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| Director Ahrens as well as Deputy Director Berry here to review those with you. So this is 44 through 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| Thank you, Amy. Thank you. I'm Brian Berry with the City of Knoxville Plans Review and Building Inspections Department, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| I'll briefly cover the next seven amendments that are before you. The request for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| amendments stem from largely through the Plans Review and Inspection, the Plans Review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| and have been identified in the zoning code, or they've come through the request of administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| as well as City Council. So we'll start with 6D.22.0A. This one is an amendment to the definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:48| and it goes along with 6F.22.0A, and this amendment is to allow the boarding of animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:57| at facilities within the city to do overnight boarding, where the definitions and the principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:49:05| use standards associated with small animal care facilities currently does not allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| So the definitions in 6D.22.0A that are requested to be amended are the animal care facility for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2950)|
| 0:49:22| small animals. We are removing the during the day, which currently prohibits overnight boarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| of animals and the business models that people would like to do, and we're also proposing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| amend the definition of kennel, which currently has five or more dogs, and we're proposing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:47| change that to animals instead of dogs. This will also be consistent with Chapter 5 of the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| Code of Ordinances with regards to animals and the definitions that are found under there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| as well as what the Animal Control Board and the definitions that they work with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| So I'm happy to answer questions specifically on this one, or we can jump to maybe 6F if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:14| Yes. Question, Mr. Berry. On veterinary clinics where they're doing like surgeries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| or taking care of an animal that's been injured or sick or whatever, they'd be able to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| on the property overnight, correct? Yes, sir. But they couldn't, they wouldn't be allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| a kennel, per se? So the way the definition currently is worded, it does allow for veterinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3032)|
| 0:50:42| offices for the treatment of animals and they can be boarded during convalescence. The way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| definition is, it does not allow boarding except for during the day for any other type of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:51:02| associated with. So if an individual wanted to have a business where they had grooming facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| training facilities associated with animals, and they also wanted to board dogs at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3070)|
| 0:51:19| the definition does not allow that based on the language in there that says during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| So that's what we're requesting to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:34| Well, I have a question, but we may just want to wait until after 6F because I don't have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| with animals, changing the terminology from dogs to animals, but my concern most specifically is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| for allowing this in the CN zone as a permitted right since so many of those CN properties are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| adjacent to residential. I think when we went through this process with RECODE, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| idea of putting the five or more was that it would limit that in so that you wouldn't have a nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3118)|
| 0:52:06| issue with a resident that's adjacent. All the other zones I think it's fine, but I do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| concern about that in CN and wondered if the requests that you've had, if any of those have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| been in the CN zone or if they've only been in the CG zone. As of right now, they've only been in the CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| zone to my knowledge. Is that something that y'all would consider just making it as a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| for the CN? As far as a special use, we could look into that. Certainly good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:53:04| I don't know. Amy, how does that typically get handled? Is that something that the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Commission can make a recommendation? Yes, they can amend the proposal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| send it forward to City Council. I think it makes sense. Unless there's any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:23| questions with 6D, if you want to jump ahead to 6F. 6F220A is the second part to the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3203)|
| 0:53:38| animal care facility. This one is associated with the principal use standards that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| for these types of facilities. The amendment here, again, changes the language from five or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| dogs and cats to animals. It also adds a sentence in that says, boarding facilities must provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| certification of compliance with Chapter 18 noise, Section 18.3. These are standards from the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| of Knoxville Code of Ordinances. This is something that in the plans review process that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| require for this proposed use to provide us something that shows a certification or a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3252)|
| 0:54:21| has been done to show the ordinance with regards to noise would not exceed that for the boarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| of animals as a proposed use there, if that makes sense. All right, we'll go to 6E. This one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:51| simply a clerical error with regards to the rules of measurement for what is allowed for detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:55:03| signs. The current code references a section to the historical districts where the old code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3303)|
| 0:55:14| referenced commercial and industrial zone districts. So we couldn't figure out why that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| changed from the commercial and industrial districts from the prior code to the historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| districts. And it deals specifically with detached signs that share common property line with interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:43| highway or detached signs on property that does not share common property line but are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| within 100 feet of the right-of-way of interstate highway and the highest interstate roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| surface is measured from the sign to the crown of the roadway surface. So the language there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:56:02| seems to be consistent with the commercial and industrial use from the prior code instead of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| historic. We'll move on to 6G. The proposed amendment to this is with regards to principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:28| use standards for drive-through facilities. As we review site plans for proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| within the city, we've had existing drive-through facilities that look to expand and are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| to meet the requirements of this code as well as proposed new drive-through facilities. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| there's a particular standard associated with the principle use that we found with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:57| the commercial highway and the commercial regional zoning districts based on the purpose statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| that we feel is better suited towards the commercial general. And so the specific requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:11| is drive-through windows and lanes may not be placed between the street and the associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| building. The purpose statements for the commercial general zoning district is to promote mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| development in a pedestrian-oriented environment, while the commercial highway and regional are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| zoning districts that the purpose statement is to accommodate higher intensity commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| of a predominantly auto-oriented character. So we feel that the commercial general zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| given the purpose statement associated with it, to promote mixed-use development in a pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| oriented environment makes sense with regards to drive-through windows and lanes not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3473)|
| 0:58:01| placed between the street and associated buildings, while on the highway and regional commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| So is that, are there, where are there drive-throughs where the windows are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| front? Is this happening somewhere? Is that why this is a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| Yes, they've been proposed. It is proposed. So it's not just windows, it's the lanes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| which is usually the difficulty that they try to have to accommodate in site design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| is the lanes are not allowed to be placed between the building and the street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| What about like on a corner lot? I mean, do you make an exception for a corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| The language in the code currently doesn't allow for a corner lot. That's one of the examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| that we run into where they have a hard time trying to design at a corner lot and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:58| run into placing the drive-through windows and lanes between the associated building and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| street. I was just thinking like that, I don't know, it's like the Chick-fil-A there near West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| Town Mall and that drive line goes between the building and I guess it's North Winston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:15| I think, but it doesn't really conflict with the other. I just wonder if there's any allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| on a corner, but currently there's not in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| So then the front of the building would be to the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| It would be facing, not facing the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Only in certain zones, correct, Brian? So it'd be like potentially in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| if this change was to go through, someone could orient the building that way to accommodate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| drive-through lane and window in the commercial, in the highway districts or regional districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| correct? Right. Yeah, potentially. Those are more auto-oriented or meant to be more auto-oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| districts. So I think we talked about that Bojangles, is that one? That's in the, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| that's in the CG district, the one in North Knox, that Gerald used to always mention? Yeah. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| Would this affect car washes? Would that be considered a drive-line? I think car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3608)|
| 1:00:19| is a separate use. Okay. So pretty much just like fast food restaurants? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:30| Yeah, car wash is a separate use in the use matrix. How do we expect to get more Chick-fil-A's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| in the city if they can't wrap the drive-through around the whole building multiple times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| I don't know. Yeah. All right. So we'll move on to 6H-220. I agree. Or OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3639)|
| 1:00:57| The following recommendation is based on through lots. Across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3657)|
| 1:01:14| there are property owners that, in having through lots or double frontages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| have difficulty in trying to use the, I guess, what would be considered a rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3680)|
| 1:01:29| So the code as it is right now for accessory structures largely prohibits any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| accessory structure in a front yard. So the parallel street that is currently not addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:46| or has the front of the house is still considered a frontage. So it has a front yard requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| and the code prohibits accessory structures in there. So it doesn't allow for detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| garages. It doesn't allow for carports. It doesn't allow for a variety of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| in Article 10.3. So what we're proposing here is to add a definition for a through lot rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:12| which would allow for property owners to place accessory structures within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| through lot rear as long as they either met the setback requirements for the district that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3740)|
| 1:02:29| in or met the average of the block face for existing principal buildings that were addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3749)|
| 1:02:40| along that street in which they're looking to place the accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| So I know the language may be a little confusing here and I'm happy to talk through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:56| Can you explain that again? So one of the challenges, and I haven't read this in detail yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| say a swimming pool. Yes. So if you have a through lot, you can't put a swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:11| in what you may consider your backyard because it fronts a street, right? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| And it kind of brings me back also to tie in these drive-thrus. What people are having to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:25| they're having to re-subdivide their property, correct? Correct. And creating a lot, needlessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| creating a lot, and they get to the same result. So they get their swimming pool but they had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| subdivide a small section of their backyard, if you will. Also, we're doing the same thing when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| we abut residential with drive-thrus, if I'm not mistaken. I think I'm one on Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:53| it rings familiar to me, next to the Kroger Shopping Center where I think the solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| because it abutted, it was a through lot, it abutted a residential and in order to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| drive-thru, they had to subdivide a section of their considered rear lot. Is that? We did have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| one that went through on Chapman, I think it was a Checkers? Yes. And they ended up relocating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| I think. But in order to solve that problem, you would have just simply gotten a survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| a re-subdivision, and you'd have gotten to the same result, right? And I think it's an unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| exercise for sure. So in this case here, that through lot, which would be approximately the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| same size as those two interior lots to the left, could have no accessory building but the interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| lot, the two interior lots to the left of it, both could have accessory buildings in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:54| That's the way it is now, correct? I believe so, if I understood you correctly. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3894)|
| 1:05:02| if we look at the through lot image up there, if you look at the word street to the top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3902)|
| 1:05:11| if the home was addressed and the front of the building door was along that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3911)|
| 1:05:21| then the rear of that building on the through lot, everything from the rear of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| to the front of the parallel street would be considered a front yard. Right. So they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| not, they couldn't have an accessory building on that entire lot. That's correct. But the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| lots next to it, each one of them could have an accessory building in the rear of their...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| Right. So what we are proposing is saying that that is a through lot rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3940)|
| 1:05:49| and so it would be required to adhere to, at a minimum, the setback requirements for principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:57| structures in that district. Or if there are existing residences on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3957)|
| 1:06:07| to the bottom of it, then they could not be closer than the average of what those existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| homes are out there right now. So if they wanted to put an accessory structure out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| and there were currently houses on the street that fronted at the bottom of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:26| they wouldn't be allowed to be closer than what the average of those existing homes out there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| in essence, you wouldn't have a pool that's placed in a location that's in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| existing homes that front along that street to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| Wish I had a whiteboard and pen here. Yeah, so I'm trying to figure out why you would go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| and add this additional language about that average of what would be on the street. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| if you've got a front yard setback down through there, presumably it's 35 feet or 25 feet or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| whatever it is, why would, unless there are lots of record or I guess where the houses would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| up on the street and they're rear loaded or something where you get stuff right up on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| sidewalk, is that what it is? Well, so you run across areas in the city where, say, the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:20| front setback requirement is 20 feet and existing homes along that street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| perhaps are at an average of 35 or 40. So what that is saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4047)|
| 1:07:37| those homes that are averaged at 35 or 40, the code is going to allow you to put an accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| structure there, but it can't be closer than that average. Okay, you're going the other way with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| Okay, got it. And it goes both ways because I believe from reading that, if you are in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| area where the houses were five feet off the street, off the front setback, then you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| push it back to where it's with the average of block face, correct? Or no, no, because you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| got the or greater language, so it would have to be that minimum rear setback. Okay. So there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| still a minimum, so if the average is five feet, the pool can't go five feet from the, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| But a structure would go five feet. Not an accessory structure. So wouldn't that be weird| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| if you have a whole block of houses and you build an ADU and the ADU is set back 30 but the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| are five or 10, then that would look out of place, right? I don't know that the code necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4118)|
| 1:08:47| wants an ADU addressing the same frontage as principle single family homes in that manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| at least if you look at the, what the code requires for accessory dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| So there's language in ADU principle standards that says an ADU must be designed so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| appearance of the principle or the primary structure remains that of a house and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| entrance to the ADU must be located in such a manner as to be unobtrusive from the same view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| of the structure that encompasses the entrance to the principle dwelling. So I would make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| case that I don't think the code necessarily wants an ADU fronting along with the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| principle buildings that are single family homes along that. It's not that it's not allowing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| it, it's just saying it's not to be addressed and considered the same as a principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| So the ADU would have to be farther in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| Do you think that if there was a situation where someone was doing an ADU and they were in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| let's say, Oakwood-Lincoln Park or East Knoxville somewhere where all the houses are much closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| and it just would look really bizarre to, if it was setback. I know of one right off in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:06| Oakwood-Lincoln Park where there's this little house in the back of the lot and it looks very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| strange. Do you think there's an opportunity for a variance to look at that front setback if there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| if it is something that, because like you said, the language for the ADU doesn't want it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| appear as a primary structure. However, I mean, part of what we're talking about here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| specifically with through lots where it is a different situation. Do you think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| could be an opportunity for BZA to hear or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| At this point, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Okay. Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| I think you need to also consider that the property is double frontage more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| let's say, a good part of the time, the property could probably be subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| and the other frontage have a primary structure or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| I have one more question about this. In terms of fences, you know, if somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| I don't right off the top of my head know the code related to fencing, but typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| you don't want a, your next door neighbor to have a big privacy fence, you know, in line. Would this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:31| are there regulations with fencing height and front yards? I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| And so, would this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Same would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| It would still apply as a front yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| So, the language in there, again, would refer back to, it has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4303)|
| 1:11:54| either meet the setback requirement for the district or the average. So, anything further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| back than the average or the setback could be greater than, I think it's 42 inches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| but anything forward of that would only be allowed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| 42 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4334)|
| 1:12:23| It's listed in, it says on through lot rear fences are limited to 42 inches when closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| than the front setback for the designated zoning district or the average of block face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| for existing principal buildings numerically addressed along that parallel street, whichever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| So, there's no room for that to be reinterpreted in this change, or is that the existing language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| No, that's the language that we added into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Okay, gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| All right, I'm going to have to get these things wrapping up here. We're quarter to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| one, and we still have a number of items that will be on the agenda for consideration. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Bon, if you want to go ahead and go through what city amendments are real quick, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| we'll move on to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| And in particular, this next one, I know it's very long, and it's a parking section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| A lot of it sounds, it looks like clean up language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Yeah, a lot of it's clean up. The only one that I'll bring to attention is there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| language that we're adding in to clarify DK district bicycle parking requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| and what this is, we're adding a sentence that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| for non-residential uses with adequate site constraints, the required number minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| bicycle parking may be reduced subject to the review and approval of the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| of Engineering. So, what that is doing, in essence, is the code currently doesn't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| for a reduction in bicycle parking requirements downtown. We're finding that as a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| developments take place downtown, it's difficult to ask for them to use square footage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| accommodate bicycle parking within a building that they're trying to use and maximize for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| business purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:15| Commissioner, can you pull your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| What does that mean for the people who have bicycles that are wanting to live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| They have to pick a different place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| So, it's for non-residential uses only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| So, residential has to provide, the language we're adding in there is for non-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| uses downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| So, a restaurant beside the lofts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Exactly. So, we're saying if that restaurant, if it's an existing building and they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| in and renovating that building, and the building is largely, takes up the entire lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| and they're creating a eating and drinking establishment in the floor, we're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| to require them to take up space, retail space that they're looking to lease or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| provide seating for and accommodate four, six, however many bicycle parking spaces there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| This is for non-residential only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Is that because there's an expectation that there would be city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| places provided for those bicycles that are adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| That's part of the reason is currently the city does provide parking, bicycle parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| in and around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| The last one, 6J22OA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Commissioner Mattis, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Yeah. I just have a clarification question on why the lot size was reduced from 100 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| 75 on that circular driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| So, that was for consistency in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| There are two sections where it conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| If you look at, it says in 11.3E2, it says on lots with no carport or garage, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:16:04| is for single family and two family dwellings, it says B, it says for lot frontage greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| than 75 feet, no driveway other than a circular driveway may be constructed in the area between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| the front wall of the principal structure and the front property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| So, there it requires 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| And if you go to what is 11.7, table 11.5, it currently says for a single family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4585)|
| 1:16:35| with lot frontage of 100 feet or more, a circular driveway is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| So, it conflicts with what the language says back in 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| Well, I guess my question is, so they can have like, so how does this affect the corner lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4608)|
| 1:16:58| Because in some instances, you have driveways that come in from some other terminus on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| corner street that might go into the back and they may have a garage in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| So, this is going to allow them to have a circular driveway as well as a driveway in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| the back that may go into a garage that's on a lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| So, a circular driveway is supposed to be along the same street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| So, if you have a corner lot, and Curtis, if you want to add into this as well, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| if you have a corner lot, the frontage along one street that you're looking to do a circular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| driveway on is supposed to accommodate that circular driveway on the one street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| It's not the addition of one street and the other corner side that allows you to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| a circular driveway, nor does it allow you to connect from one street and a circular driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| onto another street at the corner lot, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| Yeah, so they're going to have to enter and exit onto the same street, is what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| saying, not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| So, but this, you're going to allow that in addition to any other driveway, even if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| have a driveway that's in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Or, I mean, could they have a straight driveway and then add a circular driveway as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:22| I think that's going to be site specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| It really just depends on what a frontage is on one street versus another on a corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4709)|
| 1:18:29| So, I think that's just kind of a case by case, but there's nothing that says if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| have a driveway on one street frontage, you can't have a driveway on another street frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| If you can meet the code, you can sometimes have driveways on multiple roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| And you can have an interior lot where you have a straight driveway, and then it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| be a circular as well, where it kind of circles on back out to that same street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:55| I'm not sure I understand the example that you're trying to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| So, if they currently have a driveway that goes to the side, like they have a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| or a carport that's kind of behind the back of their house, and it has a straight driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| that goes to that, they're now going to be allowed to do a circular turn off of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| driveway too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| They meet certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| I think if you look at the code, it allows for a circular driveway, but it also allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| for a branch to like a garage or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| If you go to 11.3E, and it's the, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| So, are you talking about the one on the right where it has the connector that goes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| house, and from the connector, they're creating a circular driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4783)|
| 1:19:43| So, they previously can't do that on 75, but now you're saying for 75 feet, they can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| That's the provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Brian, I don't mean to speak over, but I believe that's the case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| It doesn't add an additional entrance into the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| It's basically using the circular drive's entrance and just having a branch off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| Yeah, it's just a lot of, I mean, it's just a lot of pavement in a small lot, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| have a lot of them in our neighborhood, and I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| I think that was, the intention of the code was to try to get away from having such small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| lots with lots of driveways in the front yard and parking in the front yard, and 100 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| was kind of a nice compromise for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| I think there's also language about setbacks from intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| So, like, if you've got a corner lot, you've got to be a certain distance from that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| before you can have a driveway entrance, so that would also limit some of these specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| situations, probably, with the corner lots, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4848)|
| 1:20:56| Yeah, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Again, it's site-specific, but, you know, to your point, those are currently across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| the city, and they do function and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I think for us, it's just trying to provide consistency in what the code states within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| sections of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| The last one, 6J22OA, again, this is one that is kind of a clerical error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4874)|
| 1:21:26| It's with regards to changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| The language currently in the code reads and has the word to in front of changeable price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| signs are limited to parcels with a minimum of two, 250 feet of frontage on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| And so, based on the old ordinance, the same language was there, but it did not have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| term to in front of the numerical number 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| So, that's what we're requesting to amend and remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| We're running out of time, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Do you all want to stay a little extra long, a little longer, and try to knock these out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| and wait and handle these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| No, let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| And let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| On all of these amendments for the meeting on Thursday, is there any way that those can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4941)|
| 1:22:28| be put on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| The ones that do not have any issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Yes, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| I mean, if there is an issue that one of us wants to hear, we can always pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| You can always pull it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Or anybody can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4959)|
| 1:22:39| Each individual one individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Ms. Portier, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| So, a number of you might be aware that we recently were working on a study for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| Alcoa Highway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| It's the first point of entry for people who are traveling to our area from the airport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| and kind of needs a little bit of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| So, basically for older and underperforming retail corridors, there's some pretty common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| issues that are universal, minimal buffering from adjacent residential uses, minimum outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| equipment storage screening standards, front-loading parking areas, aesthetics that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| reflect character, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Indicators of decline include declining property value, the age and condition of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| structures, vacancy rates, undeveloped parcels surrounded by low property values, and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| other criteria along in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Alcoa Highway has most of those issues, but it also has a lack of population growth when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| compared to the rest of the county, ongoing road construction over the past few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| and a high traffic fatality and serious injury crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| Statistics compared with other similar roadways in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| So, we were asked to develop an approach for managing and envisioning development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| redevelopment along the Alcoa Highway Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| So, to accomplish this objective, we've identified a few goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| The first is to allow a broader array of land use along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| The second is to protect vehicular safety improvements made by TDOT and improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| The third is to create consistency in the physical environment of development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| provide a unique sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| And so, we did a number of different outreach events and research that went into this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| There's more detail on this in the actual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| I'm just going to skirt through these really quickly in the interest of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| But there was a charrette that was done, and it involved a lot of business owners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| residents in the area, and they were a canvas as well that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| And some of the uses that you see here were the ones that were listed as things that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| would want to see in the area, the most desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| Notably, the top six answers were more retail and entertainment related, and the next tier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| I guess, was more service-related uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| These are just more of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| These are the ones that came out of the actual charrette versus the canvassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| And we also held a meeting with developers to kind of see what were some of the factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| that made one particular property more feasible and developed commercially than another, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| learned that certain variables factor into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| They look at the number of dwelling units between one and three mile radius of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| Also look at medium income level of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| And looking at the development pattern of Ocoa Highway, it's mostly single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| This is significant slope in this area here, so there's really not a lot of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| There's not a lot of rooftops is the slang term for the number of dwelling units within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| that one and three mile area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| So there's not really enough here to support commercial development along the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| So we looked at ways to include a variety of housing types, and that could be a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| priority to add dwelling units since the demand is so high right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| So opportunities, typically we want to see commercial development at nodes where you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| got classified streets that are meeting and in between those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| And so right now that's a prime area too because TDOT's added those frontage roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| and that's where a lot of existing infill opportunity exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| And there's also vacant properties, vacant parcels, vacant businesses within strip centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| There's a lot of opportunity in there for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| On the next step, we looked at comparing the cities and the counties at Nornance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| Along Alcoa Highway, one of the other challenges is that the boundary is very erratic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| So you can have a county property surrounded by city property and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| And so in looking at that, we just looked at what uses were allowed in the county, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| uses were allowed in the city, and how could we better align those so that the uses would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| be more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| And so unpacking those goals a little bit and how to add a broader array of land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| along Alcoa Highway, we kind of compared the uses that people said they wanted and looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| at whether they would be allowed in the zones that are existing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| And so some of the recommendations that we have involve adding certain uses both to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| zones and to residential zones to kind of add uses that people wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| And the next set of recommendations under this goal is to extend the mixed-use special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| district land use classification that exists in that area and also to amend it to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| a list of allowed zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| So one of the recommendations that's for the county specifically, and this would be a short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| solution until a new zoning code is adopted that recognizes the use of that zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| and the use of that zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| And so that's one of the recommendations for the county specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Until a new zoning code is adopted, and right now that's kind of on the books for after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| the comprehensive plan is developed, so it's approximately four years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| But it would align the allowed uses within the county with the city more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| The thing is, is anything that we would do to the CA and CB zones would also apply county-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| So we try to take a little bit more of a conservative approach with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| But in adding commercial land uses right now, if you look in the county's code, some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| the zones allow drive-thru facilities specifically, whereas others don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| But they do allow eating and drinking establishments and banks, which would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| And so it's kind of inferred that maybe they just wouldn't be allowed, but they are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| in practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5317)|
| 1:28:37| So if someone was not really communicating with us or with the county and just looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| the zoning ordinance to see whether a drive-thru facility would be allowed, they might walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| away with the impression that it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| So we recommend codifying that to make that a little bit more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| And then also adding arts and fitness studios to the CA and CB zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| As far as residential uses within CA and CB, right now single-family uses, single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| dwellings are allowed and also commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| So it kind of skips over some of these more transitional uses, multifamily, townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| and above-ground level dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| So in order to increase the number of rooftops and provide a variety of housing, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| proposing to add these zones in there to not only add those uses, but also to add them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| as a transition between areas where you might have a house and a commercial business next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| Looking at extending that mixed-use special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| So right now, this is where it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| It's kind of in that central area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| And so we're looking at extending it south along both sides of Alcoa Highway to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| past Maloney Road, one parcel past it, so that both sides of Maloney have the same treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| It would feel the same on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| To the north on the western side of Alcoa Highway, this area is heavily sloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| So we're not recommending to extend that any further north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| On the east side of Alcoa Highway, we are recommending extending it north one parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| to where it hits Mount Vernon Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| Right now, that parcel has got an LDR land-use class, but considering that it is at a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| major thoroughfare junction or Mount Vernon and Alcoa Highway, expecting a low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| residential use right there, I don't think anyone would want to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| So we typically like to see commercial development add these type of nodes as a cap, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| recommending to extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| This is an image from the county sector plan, so you can see here when you look at the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| so there's some extension there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| So in the city, it would also be affected, but these properties, if they did want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| rezone to any of the zones that we're recommending to be a part of the mixed-use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| they would also need a plan amendment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| When you look at the Alcoa Highway small area plan, right now this mixed-use special district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| doesn't have any zoning specifically attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| Right now, it just recommends a variety of uses, commercial, office, and medium to high-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| So in theory, any of the commercial zones could be requested for here, and it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| be supported by this sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| So what we're recommending is for the zones to be a little bit more specific and attach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| zones that are more cohesive with what we're trying to achieve in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| So in the city, that would be CG1 and CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| These are existing in the corridor already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| In the county, existing right now, we have CA, CB, and SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| However, we don't feel like SC really supports the intent or the character that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| for in Alcoa Highway, so we're proposing not to add that as one of the allowed zones, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| add CN instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| So any of the properties that are already SC, I think there's only one or two in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| corridor right now, those would be allowed to continue as non-conforming, but a new property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| wouldn't be able to rezone to SC if this recommendation were adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| One of the other things we were looking at in the city is to add the—I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| why my slide's not advancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| So the second goal is to protect vehicular safety improvements made by TDOT and improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5533)|
| 1:32:23| pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Looking at that, creating standards for vehicular access along frontage roads and connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| within the commercial centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| So that kind of talks about or kind of alludes to limiting curb cuts, and so that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| have a situation where it might be fine right now, but in 20 years, once the corridor has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| a lot more people living in it and there's more commercial areas, how many curb cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| we allow could impact the traffic flow and pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| So kind of being on the forefront of that and thinking ahead and kind of creating those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| curb cuts now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Also adding sidewalks or multi-modal facilities where the space allows to kind of protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| safety for pedestrians and cyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| We heard a lot about greenways, so connecting some of those greenways with commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| and with parks, but also building the missing link of greenway that currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| TDOT's finishing some of those, but there's going to be a link that connects to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| Knox Blount Greenway that's not being built as part of the current construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| The last goal is sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| So looking at creating standards for commercial and multifamily development to create a consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| feel along the corridor, encourage amenities within the corridor, and in cooperation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| TDOT, install local signage along the corridor and frontage roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| And so when you think of sense of place, things like boulevard entries, landscaping, how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| signage could look, the size of it, the type of materials used, those are the kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| things that we heard a lot about when we were doing a lot of public outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| We heard a lot about landscape screening, buffering between dissimilar uses, landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| within developments, within parking areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Lighting was a big concern, but also the opportunity for infill development and how that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| impact parking lot locations and building orientation, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| We heard a lot about amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| So dog parks, greenways, walking trails, open space, boulevards, plazas, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5654)|
| 1:34:22| And then finally, highway signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| So this is different from the type of signage that you would see within the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| or for a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Those would be regulated by code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| The highway signage would be under TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| So the business owners have started working with TDOT on how they could maybe get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| of these more interstate-oriented signs on Alcoa Highway to kind of help people understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| hey, get off here if you want this business, to kind of help with access and with orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| because right now I think it's a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| And so the next steps, if it is approved by you all, would go to Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and city council for their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| And then the next step after that would be maybe minor zoning and land use amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| that we kind of talked about that our staff could do, but anything that would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| a heavier lift, updates to the Knox County Zoning Code process, those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| would come a little bit later as part of that comprehensive plan, part of the research going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| into that, and then afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| So if you guys want more information, we do have a page devoted to this on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| We also have, there's a lot of social demographics and economic demographics there at the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| You can also, there's an interactive dashboard that you can look at on our website if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| interested in seeing anything about the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| And then the different items that kind of went into this report, the research, all that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| available on the website as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| Is there anything in the report that speaks to the idea of there being so much kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| abandoned development right now, that that be preferred to be redeveloped rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5758)|
| 1:36:07| using existing green space for brand new development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Is that discussed at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| It does go into infill development and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| There's not really a lot of green space left over on the section of the corridor that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| looking at in the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Right now, that's kind of that area, let me see if I can get to it on the KGIS, it's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5784)|
| 1:36:33| of that area between, I think it's Skin Farm and Maloney maybe, let's see, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5793)|
| 1:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Mr. Adams, one of the goals of this study was to really have conversations with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5815)|
| 1:37:06| community as Michelle had outlined and expand the types of uses that are allowed to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| align with what they want because when we were looking at the code and recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| there were just a lot of things that just aren't allowed that the community might want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| there and that businesses or business owners might be wanting to locate along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| You guys can't see my screen, I've got it pulled up, now I'm trying to figure out how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| to, okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| So this is kind of the area that we're talking about here so that most of the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| is infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Any of the green space is going to be towards the rear so we've got a lot of images in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| of the existing parking areas along through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| There's a lot of opportunity for smaller infill buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| The charrette went into a lot of detail on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| It was, this area was divided into four different segments and each team came up with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| site plans and that's where a lot of the dog parks, boulevard entries, plazas, that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| of thing was introduced as well as that infill development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| Does the piece of property that we had tabled maybe two months ago, is that included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5894)|
| 1:38:22| the mixed use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| Because it's right on the border, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| Yeah, it's this piece of the property right here is what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| And so this is that one that has that LDR designation that we're recommending the mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| use special district extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| Mixed use special district allows commercial and residential zoning so it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| given that it will turn commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| I think some of the concerns of the neighbors are that that SC zone that is also adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| here, that that would open the window for that to be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| But since the SC zone is not one of the zones that we're recommending be allowed under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| mixed use special district, that zone wouldn't be extended here if it were approved the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| that we're recommending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| So it might be more like a CN zone, maybe a CA zone or maybe a medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Okay, but it is included, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I'm glad you asked that because that is one of the areas that is an existing green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| So why would the recommendation be to move it from an existing green space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| I understand LDR being probably not realistic, but why would it not be a recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| protect that as sort of open space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| It's not typically our policy to recommend someone turn their privately owned land into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| a park or a green space or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| It's not a public parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| It's a privately owned parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| So that's not something that we would recommend that, hey, you need to make your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| So we're trying to work within the confines of the zoning and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| The residents have the option of trying to buy it if they wanted to through their HOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| if they were interested in protecting it, but that's not something we would really get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Cheryl, do you want to move on to item number 39?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| And this item will be, item number 10 will be on the agenda for commission's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:37| or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| I think there is going to be a public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Somebody signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| It will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| So this one came before you guys first as a rezoning and then as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| It is along Kingston Pike at the corner of Winston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| It used to be a muffler shop auto facility and it now is, well, it's under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| I don't believe it's open yet, but there's a Scooters Coffee and a Take Five oil change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| Again, it's that corner of Winston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| West Town Mall is kind of right over in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| And then CG1 is the current zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| It was recently rezoned from CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| And then here's the final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| So the purpose of the plat is to divide the parcel into two separate lots to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| two separate uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| You all remember when it came through for the rezoning, we had recommended denial based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| on the fact that we just didn't think it was the best fit to kind of introduce that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| different zoning into here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| The applicant was warned at that time that two different auto-oriented drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| facilities on such a small piece of property probably wouldn't be the best fit for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| They were told again when they came through the special use process that as part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| development, if you guys do decide that you want to subdivide in the future, you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| wouldn't be able to because you will be required to dedicate right away and to come into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| compliance with the subdivision regulations regarding the turning radius at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| We were told at that time they weren't going to subdivide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| So now they're asking for variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| They are trying to subdivide to separate those two businesses onto their own properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| And so now we're looking at this under a hardship, how it's defined in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| And so looking at each one of these, the first criteria is because of the particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| particular hardship to the owner would result as distinguished from a mere convenience if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| the strict letter of the regulations were adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| And so in looking at that criteria, it's pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| You can see there's the HP map and the FEMA map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| There's no environmental constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| The parcel size, it's pretty similar to the surrounding parcels as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| Looking at the setbacks, it's pretty in line with the same block face on the same side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| So they're proposing setbacks of approximately 60 feet and 54 feet for the two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| And right now you can see anywhere from 48, there's 55, around 40, 55, again 56 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| So they're in line pretty much with everyone else on that same block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| So it's not a hardship born out of the setbacks or how close it is to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| It's pretty comparable to everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| So that's not something that's specific to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| So we don't feel like that criteria is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| Looking at criteria three, not for financial gain as to whether or not this is specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| for financial gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| We'll leave that open to interpretation for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Other considerations, as I stated earlier, the applicants were advised pretty much every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| step of the process that what they were doing wasn't probably not the best use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| Trying to incorporate two different, not necessarily two different buildings, but both are vehicularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Both have drive-thrus which take a lot more of the land, a lot more of the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| And so we feel like trying to grant a variance for something that may not be the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| You were kind of told repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| The CG zone allows for multiple uses on the same property, so the plot's not needed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| the businesses to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| They'd be able to function and be open, remain as is without breaking any zoning violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6273)|
| 1:44:44| Criteria four, the granting of the variance wouldn't be detrimental to the public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| safety, or welfare, or injurious to other property improvements in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| Staff doesn't find that it would be injurious to the public health, safety, or welfare of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| the property, though it could impact development in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| So, again, kind of thinking 20 years into the future what development could look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| if Kingston Pike does need to get expanded and we're looking for, you know, right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| from everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| That's something we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| So, you know, one of the things that was in the applicants' statements recently was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| it's an invisible line of demarcation, but we don't think of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| We think of that right away line as being something that, you know, if the city wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| to eventually expand, what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| So, from our perspective, it doesn't meet the hardship as defined in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| regulations, and so we're recommending denial of the variances for the plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Item 19, Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| Staff, if y'all could kind of be a little more brevity on these so we can get through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6346)|
| 1:46:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| So this is K6822SP6H22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| This property is located on the north side of Barnard Road and west of Sud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| The applicant's requesting a sector plan amendment from LDR and hillside protection to MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| medium-density residential and hillside protection, and a rezoning from agricultural to planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| residential at a density of 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| This is the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| So, as you can see, this is currently part of an agricultural expanse to the west, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| there is PR at a higher density, at an equivalent density to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| However, the way that this Barnard Road operates, this really does operate more as a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6417)|
| 1:47:06| of this neighborhood that is very established as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| This is a sector plan map showing that about a third of the property is in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| protection area, and it is very much low-density residential except for kind of the outliers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6437)|
| 1:47:26| to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| And then for additional context, this is currently a forested parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| You have dense townhomes to the east, but as you pass this forest buffer going west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| of Sued Road, so this is Sued Road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| So, as you're going west, you pass this forest buffer, and you really enter a very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| This area to the west has not changed in 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| It's very established low-density residential and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| This is the slope analysis showing that, as I said, a third of the property is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| hillside protection, and the slope analysis recommends disturbing about half of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| The recommended density is about four units for a total of nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6496)|
| 1:48:23| And this is just some additional commercial access considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| I just looked at, you know, whether this would really bring more traffic into this very narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| local country road of Barnard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| There is a new food line here that is closer than the – that is the closest grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| and so the fastest way to get to your groceries is going through this very narrow 15-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6524)|
| 1:48:53| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| So the rezoning – the recommendation by staff is to deny the MDR sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| because it does not meet the location criteria for MDR, such as being a transitional area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| between commercial development and low-density residential neighborhoods, being a site with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| less than 15 percent slopes, and being along corridors served by – or proposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| served by transit and sidewalks, which this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| And then also – sorry – approving for planned residential but at a density of four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| dwelling units instead of 12 because that is consistent with the sector plan, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| also equivalent to neighboring RA zoning, which would allow up to four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6577)|
| 1:49:46| approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| So Barnard Road is pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| I circled this car here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| I don't know if you can really even see that, but the car has taken up most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| pavement width on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| So they're – this is the most cited concern by opposition to this case is concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| And the proposed density would be out of character with this established low-density neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| that surrounds it, and the slope analysis recommends four dwelling units, and as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| adjacent RA zoning is equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| I'm happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| Thank you, Mr. Newman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| Due to lack of time, I think we're going to skip over the remaining items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| They will be on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6634)|
| 1:50:44| Well, definitely the next one, item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| And, Mike, item number 27 and 28, did you intend to put those on consent or leave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Those will both be off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| So, yes, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| Any other comments before we adjourn this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| See everyone Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220607-agenda-review?start=6673)|
