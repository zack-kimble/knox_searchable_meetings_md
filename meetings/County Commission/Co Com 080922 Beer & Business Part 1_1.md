| 2:22:04| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| And Commissioner Lambert as well, if you were at the sale of the Old South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| we had one potential buyer, and that turned into two, then three, then four, then five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| and then the end result was about five times more than what we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| So you can never tell what's going to happen in a public auction environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| You know, the race don't always go to the swiftest, but that's the way to bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| And I want to place a bet on holding this until the market improves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| All right, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| No, you never know what could happen at an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| We might not get very much offered either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| Talking about the credit, talk about putting it on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| Well, I doubt very seriously it's going to end up on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| Every project that's been done downtown lately has come in here and asked for a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| I suspect whoever buys this property is going to ask for a very large TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:13| And when you start talking about financing and credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| when they come in here they say that they can own these developers, they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| I can only borrow so much money, and in order to do the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| I have to have the TIF financing in order to make the project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8606)|
| 2:23:32| So they're going to be coming back to us asking for the TIF or they can't do the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| Now, maybe when times are better we can get a better price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| when there's not a credit crunch going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| and the majority of what's caused this credit crunch right now has been real estate investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:53| You know, if we're just going to sell this property and give someone a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| we're not doing justice to the people that have been paying the taxes to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:06| We're not going to be doing justice to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| who have been paying for the transportation of these prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| You know, the majority cost of transporting these prisoners, is the sheriff still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| Sheriff, is fuel cost what drives up the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| or is it the personnel that drives up the price of having to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| because we have to have so many guards per prisoner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| and that, if I believe, we need to pay those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| and we have to continue to pay them a salary to do a very difficult job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| So you would expect not only the fuel price to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| but the salaries of these prison guards will be continuing to go up as well, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| And the number of prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| The number of prisoners is going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| As we have to buy or build another pod out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| how much would you expect the cost of a new pod out there now, 16, 17 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| Probably maybe as much as 19 million, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| I'm not saying that we necessarily need to hold it solely for possibly needing an intake center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8713)|
| 2:25:23| possibly needing it to have a downtown detention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| Maybe instead of building a pod out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| we build an intake center in some type of jail or a downtown detention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8731)|
| 2:25:40| larger than what the sheriff is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| so that maybe in the long run we save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| I think it would be short-sighted to sell this property right now with this market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| with the conditions that I think we'd have to place on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| because I would not be in favor of selling this for under what we have in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| and I would not be in favor of placing a TIF on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| because the sole reason that I've heard that it even makes sense is to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| to put it on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| and my bet would be that it would never make it onto the tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| and generate any funds for Knox County other than what little we would get out of the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| But if you would like to talk to someone who has a historic background on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:31| former Commissioner Frank Lutho, my father here, is here to speak on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| and would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| I'd like to ask you a question, Frank, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| Go ahead, Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| You want to tell your name and address is what he's talking about for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| and then I'll ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| Frank Lutho, 812 Naples Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| Frank, were there any bonds voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| I know we had a 55-cent tax increase, but were there any bonds floated for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8815)|
| 2:27:02| Bonds were floated of several million dollars for the purchase of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| the improvement of land, the leveling of land, making it up to a consolidated one that's a clean site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| So the price of the land, and I'm not sure what you have found, but you've had the purchase price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| then you have the cleanup thing of removing those buildings and making it come in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| I do not know what the total, but your figure, maybe six million, might be right for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| but you'd have to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| I would like to answer several things, and several of you have made comments that I fully agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:38| I chaired what was considered the Justice Committee for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| It started with Dwight Kessel and continued under Tommy Shumpert, county executives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| I didn't ask to be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| They asked me to do it, and I said the last thing I want to do is deal with prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| I mean, those are the people I don't like who commit crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| The citizens of this community never come down here and beg you to build a nice prison or jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8876)|
| 2:28:04| That's not something they're going to ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| There are tools, roads, other improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| But the question here is, in your position, it is your duty to provide the facilities in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:18| that is needed to take the people off the streets that need to be taken off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| You've heard some testimony already that our courts and law enforcement are releasing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| that in their judgment should not be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| They are released because they do not want to go over the cap downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| Someday that cap is going to be pushed harder and harder, and we're going to be releasing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| we should not be releasing because it's already the judgment of those people they should not be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| Now, do we need that three acres that was assembled with threat accommodation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:58| There was many property owners that were contacted to assemble that kind of area downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| We looked at many, many different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| I remember one along the river, and somebody called up and says to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| Mr. Leuthold, I don't think prisoners should look across the Tennessee River on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| And I says, where do you think they look today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| He says, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| And I says, they look across the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| So that by itself wasn't really an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| Now, as Sheriff Jones says, if in fact we would build an intake center down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:32| on the so-called green area of this place, that might be the time when we ought to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:38| maybe we don't need that three acres over there because we've made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| But we haven't made that decision yet as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| Building pods out there, yes, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| You borrow the money and you transport them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| And I remember the last thing the consultant for this ever said is every time you move a mile away from downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=8993)|
| 2:30:00| which is pretty much the center of the population, you increase your transportation costs considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9000)|
| 2:30:07| He says keep it to the center basic where the population is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| To address the issues of whether you should sell or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| the decision should be is that you really do want to dispose of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| and you do not want that space to be used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| Another consideration is in fact the market time and timing for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:28| You know, I would agree that if you're going to market something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| if I wanted to sell my home right now, I probably wouldn't want to sell my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| because I wouldn't think it's a good market to sell my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| It is a soft market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| And you do limit the number of people that would go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| And I clearly agree that if it is sold, you can take all the money out of your checking account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| and all the money out of your saving account and put it on a bet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| that the buyers of that will come before this commission and ask for tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:58| In other words, government financing of the project and it will exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| The property will not go on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| It won't add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9065)|
| 2:31:06| Unless you want to go for 20 years and maybe 20 years from now it will be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:10| I think it's a poor decision until it is decided we absolutely do not need this piece of property for the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:18| So if the sheriff comes in and you decide to build in the green area here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| and you do that, that might at that point say we do not need that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| Until that decision is made, I think it would be a very poor decision for this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:35| But I respect commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| I was on this commission for 22 years plus eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| And I respect commissioners making the decisions on the basis of all the input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| But my advice would be this is a poor time and poor decision to try to sell this land for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:54| until you make some other decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| I think Sheriff Jones, I won't speak for him, he's talked about an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| But, Sheriff, that doesn't give us any more bed space downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| And I kind of envision at some point in time a new justice center with the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| and KPD side-by-side maybe in the same building with joint construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9135)|
| 2:32:20| and the city helping some officers work day-to-day side-by-side, you know, out there on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:27| And I know KPD probably built their building in 1960, so it's probably, I'm sure they've outgrown it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:34| I don't know if we could ever put a 3.66-acre track in downtown Knoxville again ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9154)|
| 2:32:43| During committees, Mr. Troyer said, let's go with Commissioner Pinkston's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| And I said, no, what's your numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| You are the finance director for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| Well, let's go with Commissioner Pinkston's number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| And we started asking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| And now we see it's at least 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| And, you know, it was just a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| You want to say something, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:09| In your packet, you may not have noticed, but in your packet we have done some further research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9189)|
| 2:33:13| There's discussion about should we include some demolition costs, should we include some relocation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| And we've provided that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| The purchase of the land was $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| Addition of the property of the parking lot, the asphalt, which may or may not add to the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| was about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| And then there was further some demolition and relocation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9210)|
| 2:33:33| I think Commissioner Pinkston's new numbers, I haven't seen them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| but at least I've heard about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| And from my understanding, they include part of the justice center's project costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| which don't add value to the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| If you have architectural fees on a justice center that doesn't go, that doesn't add to the value of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| Would you agree it's money spent of taxpayer dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| Sure, it's money spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| But it's money spent on a project that the county made the choice not to go forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| Just like if I own a house and I rip the kitchen out and it really didn't need to be ripped out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| because it was very nice with granite countertops and I put granite back in, I've spent the money on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| If I sell it, I'm expecting I'm going to get what I put back in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| not because, well, it had kitchen cabinets and so I have no real value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| If we spend taxpayer dollars, we've got to count that somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| Or if you have a house and you make plans for a pool but never put in the pool, it doesn't add value to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:25| You wouldn't add for the pool, but you'd add for the cost of what you plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| Well, the point of it is you're the finance director and you came down here at committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| and even either unprepared because if you're getting ready to sell something, you would think we would know what we had in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9276)|
| 2:34:43| Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| The numbers, let me just talk about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9284)|
| 2:34:47| But let me just get to my point first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| Purchase price of the land was $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| We added a half a million dollars on the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| And since then there was an additional number, amount of money for demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| relocation of another half a million dollars or so, round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| And in your packet you've got $3.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| And those are what I consider fair numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| The purchase of land by itself was just $2.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| Commissioner Moore, may I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| I'm going to have to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| Mr. Chair, I think you need to acknowledge people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| I mean, they're just blurting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| Commissioner Moore, I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| There's other people talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| You're blurting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| Commissioner Moore, I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| You know, I think with what everyone else has said here today or most of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:41| thinks it's a bad time, it's a bad market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| I think we could never reassemble 3.66 acres in downtown Knoxville again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9343)|
| 2:35:48| We've got $6.4 million in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| We could sell it for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| I don't think that's a good deal for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| At some point in time, I think we're going to do something with it or maybe a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9359)|
| 2:36:00| But we've made a decision for the time being that we're going to turn some people loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| And I think our community is starting to see the benefits, or not the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| but the reactions and the things that are happening in our community because we are letting people go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:14| And so I'm going to be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| And I hope this commission votes to deny this too as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| Because I remember just about two years ago where we gave Blount County $5 million to be a joint business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:28| John, how many checks have we received back off that $5 million that we helped with the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:36| that we were going to get some money back on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| The Blount Business Park is not on the agenda today, but just for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9399)|
| 2:36:44| it was a long-term investment and we're not expecting short-term returns on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| I think the question today is do we want to use this 3.66 acres to build a justice center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| or do we want to or why, eight years after the county made the decision not to pursue the justice center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| do we still own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| Well, I think that gets to my point that we spent $5 million a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| and we've not received anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| We're going to sell this land and, say, put it back on a tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| and it will never be back on a tax roll because no one will do a deal downtown this size without public financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9433)|
| 2:37:21| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| Mr. Troy, I don't know if you have the piece of paper that Commissioner Pinkston has provided us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| I have not seen Commissioner Pinkston's numbers, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| I guess there's some kind of budget code, 9-1-1-0-1, that deals with everything from the State Street property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9456)|
| 2:37:43| and then it goes to Gay Street and then the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| There's one that said for 1.3, I'm guessing, million dollars for architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:52| That's for the justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| That didn't go, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| That was starting the project that didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Okay, so I think we can all agree that 3.1 was probably low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:07| but this 6.4 I'm having issues with as well because I do agree that if you plan a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9487)|
| 2:38:15| if you plan an addition and you hire an architect, that's a shame on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:21| So I think previous commissions made some serious errors in judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9501)|
| 2:38:27| And when I say that, I mean from the public spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:32| And we've all dealt with when the public speaks very loudly, we need to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:39| In that particular case, as we said with Will Tax, they voted for 8 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:46| Doggone it, they said 8 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| They also said no justice center at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9529)|
| 2:38:54| Okay, so we can talk about this, and really this conversation kind of deteriorating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| into the justice center disturbs me because I think the people have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:05| No one was in favor of building the justice center on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| And I know we have to kind of think, well, not necessarily think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| that we have to make tough decisions, but we have to listen to our constituents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| And I don't think we have an uneducated population that we serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| and they have told us they don't want it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| So in my mind, I think we need to keep that not in the back of our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| but at the front of our minds, the fact that the people have spoken and we should move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| Now, as far as TIFs go, I don't know whether one would be requested for this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9576)|
| 2:39:44| but I can state right now that I would not support a TIF at this point, period, not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:51| I would not support a TIF for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| in that we've already done a lot of environmental restoration to that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| It's on clean dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| There's no demolition involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| It will be pretty much a green field that they're looking at, other than some asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| So, you know, I do agree that use of TIFs for a project like this would be very unwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9608)|
| 2:40:17| and I won't be supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| But in terms of the Justice Center being built on this land, again, I'll just end with the people have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9619)|
| 2:40:27| No one wanted it, other than the folks that voted for it on this body, unless if they did, they didn't voice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:33| There was no outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| There was an outcry to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| So I think we need to keep that in the front of our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| It does feel a bit like Commissioner McKenzie was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| It feels kind of like we're going in circles here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| I would like very much to hear from the administration, from Mayor Ragsdale and John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| to talk a little bit about this whole project and the, I think, positive reasons to put this on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9656)|
| 2:41:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| First, the contract, if there is one, the auction bid, if there is one, will come back to you for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| That judgment will fall to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| You can decide if it's a good price or a bad price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| Secondly, Commissioner McKenzie was absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| There was a public outcry saying, don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| We don't want it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| Some mentions about courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| Those were good questions about courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| I dare say, if you walk to our courtrooms right now, that two-thirds of them, if not all of them, are sitting completely empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:37| So you may have to look at going for a different amount of time, night courts and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9697)|
| 2:41:42| You heard some about that from your judge candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| In terms of getting your return on investment, in my opinion, if you want a return on investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9704)|
| 2:41:52| the only way you're going to get it is probably not through your sales price but by getting it back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| and that's getting out from under the debt of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:01| That's the only way it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| This was a very well-intended idea of a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9723)|
| 2:42:10| It was not necessarily, upon reflection, a really good idea, but it was well-intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9730)|
| 2:42:15| The farmer's market was a very well-intended idea, but it too turned out to be a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:25| Look at it, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| It turned into a weed farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| It was a disastrous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| Now what you have is part private sector, part public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:36| You can't hardly go there any time of the day or night that it's not a great success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| What we're saying is why not try and see what you can get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| It doesn't mean you have to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| It just means you're going to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| Nobody approves TIFs but you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| That decision is completely up in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| I do think, quite candidly, that the sheriff has got to have an intake center where you don't put people on a bus and move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9774)|
| 2:43:03| That's the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| Now, granted, it costs more money to take them to Maloneyville Road than it would down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:08| but when you just add Mass General Store, a group of condominiums, a Tennessee theater which you invested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:16| an East Tennessee History Center, do you want a jail sitting adjacent to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| I think that sort of defeats the purpose a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| So what we were trying to do was we've had several developers approach us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| give us a shot at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| Ultimately, you'll decide whether it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| That decision lies in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| But I do think that if anyone believes we're going to recoup all of our money off the sales price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:42| that's just not probably going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| The way you get your return is off tax revenues when it gets on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:49| or if it has some type of draw where it draws sales tax in from outside of the area or creates additional wealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9829)|
| 2:43:55| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| So I would encourage you to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| Commissioner Leuthold and I served together when this was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| Again, it was a very well-intended idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| So you don't have anything to lose by just giving it a try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| And then you can decide if you've got a good price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| You can decide if you've got a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| You can decide if you want to give a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| Those are ultimately all your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| But the community said it didn't want a jail there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| But let me emphasize this point one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| It's incredibly inefficient to have an intake center at Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| It's incredibly inefficient to put people on a bus and transport them anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:29| whether it's State Street or Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| So I think our challenge is if you do something here, how do you do it while preserving green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| the integrity of the buildings, the look of the facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:39| And Sheriff Jones is taking a look at that, as I mentioned to you in my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| He's been cooperative in discussions with me on it, and I think those should continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9882)|
| 2:44:46| But I would give this a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| I'm sure it doesn't hurt anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| Wait just a minute, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| I wasn't quite finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| There is one other item I wanted to mention, and it's been mentioned several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| and the mayor just mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| Our jail overcrowding situation may or may not be strictly up to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:09| I think we all received a report, as I recall, last week or the week before, produced in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:19| at the mayor's request that dealt with this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| John Owings, at our hearing last week when we interviewed the judge candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9922)|
| 2:45:28| talked about this report at some length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| and it offered solutions to the problem that did not entail building more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9932)|
| 2:45:39| So there are some solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| I think we're just dwelling on one possible solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:45| Building more space may or may not be the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| And finally, I would invite everybody here, who I'm sure you've received an invitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| to attend the TIF training session this coming Monday from 9 until 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| I believe it's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| It's a small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| Yes, it's a small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| We clubbed golf courses to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| It took us 25 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| We've been at this for 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| My light's been on since five minutes after four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| We've talked about TIFs, pods, price of gas, schools, library books, debt, market improvement, investment banks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9984)|
| 2:46:38| where to bet your money, market timing, the Justice Center, jail overcrowding most recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:48| And I left one out, and I need to go back and address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10008)|
| 2:46:52| The golf course and the detention facility are not halfway to Marstown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10012)|
| 2:47:00| I have to drive past both of those to get home this evening, and I'd like to do it before midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10020)|
| 2:47:10| This resolution simply stated, after we've simply beat it to death with if, ands, and buts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10030)|
| 2:47:21| has in it that we own some property, and it's surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10041)|
| 2:47:29| And we should sell it at auction if we raise $4.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10049)|
| 2:47:38| And that's all that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| There's not a but in that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| And it's surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Sell it if it raises $4.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| We don't need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Now, do I need to read my list again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| Do we need to talk about these other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| This is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| It's either yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10079)|
| 2:48:02| Commissioner Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| I just wanted to say I don't think the real estate market is going to improve anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10084)|
| 2:48:10| I think it's going to be five more years before we see a good real estate market again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10090)|
| 2:48:16| I also think that development downtown is still going full blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10096)|
| 2:48:21| I think that this property could be a real asset between tying together the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10101)|
| 2:48:28| and Gay Street and Market Square and providing that corridor of activity to keep people moving from one place to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10108)|
| 2:48:36| And if we're concerned about how much we're going to get from it, from doing it at auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10116)|
| 2:48:44| can we not do it by RFP and just see what we get and see if we think that's a good idea or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:53| I mean, I don't think this has to be as complicated as maybe we're making it out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10133)|
| 2:49:00| Our request was to ask the commission for the method of disposal for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:07| and your choices are an auction, a seal bid, which would include RFPs, or a negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10147)|
| 2:49:13| Those are the three different choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| I agree with Deb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| I think this is maybe getting more complicated than it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| And the auction is not absolute auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| It's just a plain auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| It has to bring whatever amount we say or would approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:33| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| Yes, I want to make this completely clear to Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10175)|
| 2:49:40| The figures that Mr. Troy was talking about were all the figures I could have at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| and I stated at the intergovernmental that those figures, I did not know whether they were true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10185)|
| 2:49:51| To give you a little example, if you look on the paper that we have there, the first piece, the money spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10191)|
| 2:49:58| it's got the land acquisition was $2,719,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| I got a letter from PBA that said we had $2,736,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:08| Now, that's not a whole lot of difference, you might say, but yet they're two different figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| So I really don't know what we do have in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| It seems like I can't get straight figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| But I want to ask this to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| Mr. Law Director, I understand that we floated bonds on that, according to Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10221)|
| 2:50:30| Is it legal for us to spend bond money that we bought, that we floated, on a Pacific project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10230)|
| 2:50:42| and not have to reimburse that money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10242)|
| 2:50:47| You can't spend it on operational funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| It depends on the covenants in the bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| and it's my understanding that the general obligation bonds that were issued in anticipation, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10253)|
| 2:51:05| of building a justice center were public improvement bonds, and it was not limited to construction of a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10265)|
| 2:51:13| They were very broadly worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| I have a copy of the closing binder, and it was for virtually any public improvement purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10278)|
| 2:51:28| not operations but public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10292)|
| 2:51:34| I would like to amend this using the figures that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10294)|
| 2:51:41| The figures from the demolition changed from $485,000 to $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10301)|
| 2:51:46| I believe it was $36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| Is that correct to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10308)|
| 2:51:51| $528,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| The relocations there, we've got the relocation money of $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| I would like to amend this if it sells at a minimum of $4.2 million and no TIFs whatsoever on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10320)|
| 2:52:12| We're giving up taxpayers' money that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| There has not been the first project downtown since I've been here that we sell this property and they come right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10335)|
| 2:52:25| well, I can't get the figures right if we don't get a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| Don't buy it if you can't get your figures right is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10348)|
| 2:52:33| I would like to put that we do not give any TIFs on any property like this that we sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| And that's this property right here at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| I would like to amend it $4.2 with no TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10360)|
| 2:52:47| Commissioner Pinkston, your motion was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:50| I know, but I believe that's going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| I didn't get a second on the deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| Yeah, you got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10376)|
| 2:52:57| Well, I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10377)|
| 2:52:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10380)|
| 2:53:06| I'd like to withdraw my motion and put this in there if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10386)|
| 2:53:11| If the second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| I mean, I don't care what he does, but, you know, I want to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| Well, I guess the question is do you second what he's doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10403)|
| 2:53:24| If he wants to, I'll get off with the second if he wants to redo it, but then I'd like the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10404)|
| 2:53:28| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| No, you second it to agree to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| He can get another second for the 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10418)|
| 2:53:41| No, you have to agree to withdraw the 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| I'll agree to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10424)|
| 2:53:45| Okay, now he can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10425)|
| 2:53:46| Now, Commissioner Pinkston, 4.2 with no TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| Several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10435)|
| 2:53:56| Can the question be separated so that we can vote on the TIF part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10436)|
| 2:54:04| and the dollar amount and whether or not to even sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10444)|
| 2:54:10| I would like to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| Commissioner Pinkston, he made the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| Are you putting that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| I'm just asking you as a friendly type of amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10459)|
| 2:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10460)|
| 2:54:22| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| I'd like to make a substitute motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| You know, I just want to say that we've spent $6.4 million of taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| and we're not going to get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| And, you know, I think we need to see what the county or city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| or jointly we could use this land for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| You know, if we sell it, we ought to roll the taxes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| We've done charge the people of Knox County wants to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10493)|
| 2:54:56| and we didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| So if you all decide to sell it and it passes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| I think we ought to roll back the tax rate for the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| because we've not done what we said we were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10504)|
| 2:55:11| You second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10516)|
| 2:55:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| I look forward to the discussion on the criminal justice system here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10519)|
| 2:55:23| I believe it is more than just an intake center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10523)|
| 2:55:26| or whether or not we should have a justice center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10526)|
| 2:55:28| but I believe there are preventative programs we need to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| without going into great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| I just look forward to that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| But, Hugh Holt, to the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:36| We're looking at doing this as a public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| Commissioner Borles brought up the idea of perhaps RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| Is there merit to going with the RFP as opposed to the auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10542)|
| 2:55:46| now that we're at, like, for example, a $4.2 million figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| I would recommend an IFB, which is an invitation for bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| which is just hard priced to, if we're going to go that direction instead of the public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10554)|
| 2:56:01| if you're just testing the waters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| obviously it won't cost you anything other than the administrative costs that my department will incur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| for issuing the solicitation and receiving the bids in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| If you go through the public auction process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| of course you're going to have marketing expenses and other advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| and expenses of that nature, which are real dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| which will be coming out of my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| And I'm sure a commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| Yes, and that was my other part, is the cost involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| Let's say that it is brought back to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| and the body rejects it and says, well, we've taken a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| and this is not an absolute auction, we just don't like the idea here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| There's going to be monies that are going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| What enticement do we have from the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| knowing that if they go through an auction process or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10605)|
| 2:56:49| and they've put together their best bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| and that knowing that it could come back to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| and commission is just not going to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| So that's why I'm asking which is the best way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| because I'm all in favor of just throwing it out there and let's see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10618)|
| 2:57:01| I mean, you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| Based on the conversations that I've heard today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| I think you're going to be better served at this point going with an invitation for bid versus a public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10624)|
| 2:57:10| So the motion on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| We'll have to vote on that first, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10634)|
| 2:57:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| First of all, if I recall right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| it wasn't every citizen of Knox County that came down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| or really even voiced their displeasure with the possibility of a justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| I remember a lot of people that were still in favor of it when the project was killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10652)|
| 2:57:38| Was it well intended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| I think absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| But as we look on the decision now of not doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:46| we're starting to see that maybe that wasn't as good an idea as we thought it was then to not proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10666)|
| 2:57:54| We've just heard how much money we've spent building two pods already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10674)|
| 2:57:58| how much money we're spending annually in transporting these prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10678)|
| 2:58:03| So as we look in our hindsight again as to whether or not it was a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:08| or not a good idea to not build the justice center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10688)|
| 2:58:13| it may not have been the best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| Maybe building it would have been, after all, now that we have a historical look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10695)|
| 2:58:21| But I would think I would be in favor of possibly selling this land once we make the final decision on what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10701)|
| 2:58:31| If it's simply to build an intake center downtown and we have that moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10711)|
| 2:58:39| then maybe it's time to sell this property to pay for that intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:45| And if that, you know, Sheriff Jones, is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10725)|
| 2:58:51| Or I'll tell you what, Chief, maybe you can answer this or the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| Do we have any idea when we might hear or have a plan before us about the intake center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10738)|
| 2:59:05| Are we talking within next year's budget or the year after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10745)|
| 2:59:13| You received the letter I wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| I called the sheriff and asked him about the verbiage I put in there before I sent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10755)|
| 2:59:20| And I said, are you okay with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| He said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| I don't recall verbatim what it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| but I was left with the impression that that doesn't fall within any criminal justice plan that he envisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| or it certainly doesn't fall on any that I envision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| Well, what I'm asking is, is he has brought forth the idea of building an intake center out here on the green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:42| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| We are looking at how it might look and what it might cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10783)|
| 2:59:50| And any idea when a project like that could come before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| So, I mean, are we talking possibly this year or are we talking a little further out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| It could be, well, certainly you're not going to get anything before the end of this fiscal year in terms of a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:07| Sheriff Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| Unless he brings it, you're not going to get it from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| I'm just curious as to, you know, we're talking about a possible solution to save some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| And before we make this decision, I would like to know that, Sheriff Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10819)|
| 3:00:25| when do you think we might see before this commission an intake center project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| I mean, are we talking one year, two years, five years, ten years out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| I think what we had first talked about was probably having something built and in place in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10834)|
| 3:00:42| Right now we're going back to the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10842)|
| 3:00:45| I think Ron Boomers had done some planning on this before, and their next step was to get back with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10845)|
| 3:00:52| take a look at the plans, see what we wanted, bed space, what we agreed to do, and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10852)|
| 3:00:58| until we brought something comprehensive to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| I didn't want to bring you a piece of mail or start talking about stuff and not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10862)|
| 3:01:06| And I appreciate that, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| But I was curious, because, you know, we're trying to make a decision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| And if we sort of had an idea that, hey, within the next year or two, we're going to have this project come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10872)|
| 3:01:20| then maybe that's the time to take a look at selling this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| because you've got the plan in place for what this land was intended was to help relieve the overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10884)|
| 3:01:30| And if this is what we ultimately do, then maybe then we use the money from the sale of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10890)|
| 3:01:38| time it so that it takes care of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| Now, I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| And it might be, you know, if we're talking about holding onto the property for another year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| then hopefully the economy recovers, it's a better market, we get more money for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10909)|
| 3:01:56| and we know the project that the funds are going to go to, instead of there just being this abstract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10916)|
| 3:02:02| maybe we need to hold onto it because we don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| Let me give you just an idea of what I'm talking about at Intake Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| I'm talking about a small building, not something the size of State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10929)|
| 3:02:14| And what I'm saying is if we're going to build that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10934)|
| 3:02:18| and maybe it's comparable in cost to the price that maybe we can sell this for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| and it ends up that we don't have a burden on the taxpayers to pay for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:29| but we've got this land here that we bought for this intention that we then turn around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10949)|
| 3:02:35| we sell it, and it pays for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:38| That makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| Commissioner Chauff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| The numbers that have been put before us by Commissioner Pinkston are very sobering numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10965)|
| 3:02:51| and I agree with the 6.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| I think that's what Commissioner Moore just said, 6.4 million, and the argument for his 6.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10974)|
| 3:03:01| Oh, the 6.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10981)|
| 3:03:02| I'm just looking at the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10982)|
| 3:03:03| The 6.4, but I think Commissioner Pinkston was going to say it's probably closer to 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10983)|
| 3:03:08| Okay, 6.2 then, of which at least two million of it, we see a million eight in architectural fees and consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10988)|
| 3:03:17| That's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| Contracts with government agencies, whoever those people may be, nearly 800,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| and contracts with other entities, 300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| So that's approaching $3 million that's probably irretrievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| But are these, the other column shocks me also, Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11009)|
| 3:03:33| Is that, was there a gay street component to this thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11017)|
| 3:03:38| So can I, am I, is there a gay street piece of property left that can be sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11018)|
| 3:03:44| No, if I'm not mistaken, they traded that to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11024)|
| 3:03:47| Is that not right for the, gave it to them for the transportation deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| I thought that was for the, some of that went for the theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| The theater, and then they traded you both, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:00| Well, then the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11040)|
| 3:04:01| Let Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| Can you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11044)|
| 3:04:05| We traded the gay street site, which is going to be part of the entrance, with the city for the old new Sentinel site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11045)|
| 3:04:12| the old new Sentinel site, which went out for the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:15| Hey, can I add 30 more seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| When we went through this process of looking at the old State Street and the new Sentinel site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11057)|
| 3:04:23| and the new Sentinel site is where the new Sentinel used to occupy, be occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| we had public hearings, discussed both sites, said we're going to try to look at RFPs for both sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11067)|
| 3:04:34| We brought the RFP for the new Sentinel site to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| The commission approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| That was almost two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| That piece of property has finally been closed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| At that time, commission said do not proceed on the RFP for State Street until you hear from developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11084)|
| 3:04:51| When you hear from developers for positive interest, bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| So that's what the process has evolved to the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| We've heard from three different developers, and that's why we brought this piece of property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| It wasn't for any other reason other than we heard from the development community that they had interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11104)|
| 3:05:10| And I think Commissioner Pinkston was the one who said let's keep this piece of property in abeyance until we hear from developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11110)|
| 3:05:16| So that's what led to this being added to the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| Mr. Harms, Mr. Harms, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11123)|
| 3:05:24| Out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11124)|
| 3:05:25| Commissioner Fonda said the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| I was just going to add, so we paid $2.1 million for the Gay Street property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11127)|
| 3:05:35| of which we basically swapped for the Sentinel site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11135)|
| 3:05:39| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:41| Sold for $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11141)|
| 3:05:42| But then we still left $800,000 on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| It went up in smoke basically in consulting fees and this and that fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| So we can add $800,000 at 6.2 and put it well over 7 that's in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11149)|
| 3:05:56| Plus interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| Plus interest of debt service at $280,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| That would be approaching $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| A little over $9 million if we want to put a debt service on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11163)|
| 3:06:06| I just wanted to get that column two out with some public scrutiny to make sure I wasn't missing something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11166)|
| 3:06:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11174)|
| 3:06:15| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11175)|
| 3:06:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11176)|
| 3:06:17| So we beat on boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11177)|
| 3:06:23| That's the last line of the great Gatsby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| And I'm quoting the last line of a book, so maybe we can close the book on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:32| Like Commissioner Wright, I've been amazed at the level of retrospection on past issues and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:41| We have learned almost incidentally along the way that probably the best way to handle this is to put our foot in the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11201)|
| 3:06:48| and do that by an invitation for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| So I think the most logical course of action is simply to defeat this motion to defeat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11211)|
| 3:06:57| and then come back with a motion to approve this as an invitation for bid and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11217)|
| 3:07:05| I hope that's the course of action after all of this that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11225)|
| 3:07:09| Therefore, I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| I hope we defeat the motion to defeat, come back to the original question, make it an invitation for bid, and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11231)|
| 3:07:18| I would second the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11238)|
| 3:07:21| Go ahead in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11241)|
| 3:07:25| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| No, this is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| It's on the call? Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11252)|
| 3:07:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11253)|
| 3:07:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11254)|
| 3:07:35| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11256)|
| 3:07:37| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11257)|
| 3:07:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11260)|

| 3:09:19| Motion fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:20| Five yes, 13 no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11360)|
| 3:09:21| We're back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11361)|
| 3:09:22| Could you restate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| Because I think Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| Was Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| That's your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Could you restate your amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11369)|
| 3:09:30| Well, I asked, Commissioner Pinkston has a motion on the floor, I guess to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:35| Mr. Pinkston. Could you restate your amendment? Well, I ask, Mr. Pinkston has a motion on the floor, I guess, to sell it at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11375)|
| 3:09:46| 4.2. As a minimum bid of 4.2 and that there be no TIF and I ask that the question be divided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11386)|
| 3:09:54| as to whether there would be a denying the TIF or not as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11394)|
| 3:10:03| Mr. Chairman, I make a substitute motion to pass the resolution as written with the blank filled in invitation for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:11| Second. Substitute motion to that effect. Commissioner Lutho. I guess my question would be, Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11411)|
| 3:10:26| as these bids come in, then it would be up to commission as to whether or not we accept whatever the best bid is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11426)|
| 3:10:35| That's correct, sir. Okay. And we don't have any idea what they're going to be. Now, it'll be out there and it'll be a sealed bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:43| That's correct and we can put a minimum on it. We can put a minimum on it? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:50| Commissioner Mark Harmon, would you be willing to put a minimum? 8.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11450)|
| 3:10:58| Give me a reasonable figure and I'll be happy to add it. 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:02| I think the 4.2 is reasonable if you want to think of a different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| Well, now, does the 4.2 include the contracts with government agency and the contracts with other entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11467)|
| 3:11:17| As well as the consultant? Well, I guess you'd have to ask Commissioner Pinkston. That was his number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11477)|
| 3:11:22| Yeah, did you use those to get at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| No, the way I arrived at the 4.2 is, taking the figures that they gave us, we've got about three point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11484)|
| 3:11:34| well, we had $3,221,000. We had, you know, the demolition money went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:45| The relocation fee, that put us up close to 3.8, I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| And this has to be worth a little bit more money now, 10 or 11 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11508)|
| 3:11:52| So you're not talking about that much more money. And I just think the 4.2 is a good, reasonable figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11512)|
| 3:12:00| I can't tell you that my figures are correct, Mr. McKenzie. Like I say, I can even get different figures on what we paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:09| I'm sorry. So you have 3.8 in what you can best cobble together as fairly hard numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11529)|
| 3:12:15| A little over 3.8. And so we're adding roughly about $300,000 to it, is all, for the time we've held it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11535)|
| 3:12:24| I can live with that as a friendly amendment. IFB with a minimum bid of 4.2. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11544)|
| 3:12:36| And did you want to add anything as far as TIFs? Because I've heard several commissioners here talk about they expect us to be on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:43| And if we have a TIF involved in this, then we've defeated the purpose of trying to add this back into the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11563)|
| 3:12:51| I believe your initial idea that that should be voted on separately is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| Okay. Well, I guess, would you like to have that? Would you accept that as a friendly amendment to add that on as a separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11574)|
| 3:13:03| If you want to move that after this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| Well, it would have to be part of your substitute motion, but we would divide your substitute motion into two parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11586)|
| 3:13:12| Okay. Divide the substitute motion into two parts. First, we would vote on the IFB 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11592)|
| 3:13:17| No, I guess the best way to do it would be to vote on whether or not we deny or make it impossible to have a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11597)|
| 3:13:26| Vote on that first, and then we would vote on whether to do the rest of it, which would be the RFP with a minimum bid of 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11606)|
| 3:13:35| Okay. I will amend my motion as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| First, we vote on a 4.2 IFB, minimum bid IFB, 4.2 mil, then a vote to follow on whether we want to at this moment specifically rule out a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11618)|
| 3:13:53| Well, see, I would ask that it be reversed because it would influence how I would vote on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11633)|
| 3:14:00| Well, now, could...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11640)|
| 3:14:01| Well, it's up to you. How do you vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| But since you're the maker of the motion...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| I'm the maker of the motion. I prefer deciding what to do before you decide on how to limit it. So I want to stick with my order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:13| See, now, I'm...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| Does the second agree? I think it's a legitimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11662)|
| 3:14:28| Well, all the lights turned out. Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| I still just want to speak against that. Everybody sitting here acting like we're getting a great deal at 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11671)|
| 3:14:36| We've got almost $10 million in this piece of property, and we think we're going to give the citizens such a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11676)|
| 3:14:41| We're selling it for 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| We've done give away $5 million to Blount County, and we heard about the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| What did we have in the farmer's market from the beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| Commissioner Moore, what can we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| Well, I mean, you want to talk about this, but you have to talk about the past to get...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| You know, they are the ones that brought up the farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| We sold it for, what, $12 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| And I don't think we had, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| We're here today to talk about states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| Forget I even asked. I mean, you're never going to get nothing from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11708)|
| 3:15:13| It is crazy for the taxpayers to be charged $6 million, and we think we're giving them a great deal, and this is a great deal for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11713)|
| 3:15:21| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| If we vote to have an amendment on here or whatever where we will not put a TIF on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11723)|
| 3:15:29| what does that do, let's say, five or ten years now to a future commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| This is really a question I'm directing to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11733)|
| 3:15:37| If there is a project that someone brings here that really looks good, that the citizens want, that the commission wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11737)|
| 3:15:43| but we have this prohibition against a TIF, what bearing does that have on it legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11743)|
| 3:15:52| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| If you vote today to limit placing a TIF on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11754)|
| 3:16:05| and you also vote to allow an invitation for proposals or an invitation for bids limited to $4.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11765)|
| 3:16:15| that doesn't bind a future commission to come back within a prescribed period of time and change its mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11775)|
| 3:16:25| And that commission would be able to, with a motion duly made and seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:34| say we have changed our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| So I guess in reality what I'm asking, even if we say we don't want to give a TIF now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11796)|
| 3:16:41| we could come back in six months and say it's okay to give a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11805)|
| 3:16:49| I think it sends a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| Yeah, this is getting awfully confusing, but could we divide this question three ways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11813)|
| 3:17:04| Because for one thing, if the no TIF passes, I don't know that we should set a minimum bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:13| because most of the projects in the downtown area have been done with a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11833)|
| 3:17:18| and I'm thinking that there may be someone that would be willing to bid, say, $3 million for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11838)|
| 3:17:26| and then do a project that would not require a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11846)|
| 3:17:31| and then there would be someone else that may give $5 million for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| but would require a TIF that would wind up costing us a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:39| So, I mean, it would really affect how I would vote on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| if we decided the minimum bid separately and the TIF issue separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080922beerbusinesspart1?start=11864)|
