| 0:00:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=5)|
| 0:00:06| We'll go ahead and start the agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=6)|
| 0:00:08| If I can take just a second for personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| Yesterday in the election we've seen there are going to be many changes in Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| And to be fair with my fellow commissioners and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| I'm going to step down as chairman of the Knox County Commission effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=20)|
| 0:00:27| I want to thank the commissioners that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| It's been a privilege and an honor to serve as your chairman over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=28)|
| 0:00:38| But it may be time for someone else to lead the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=38)|
| 0:00:41| So I'm going to turn it over to the best vice chairman in the state of Tennessee, my friend Tank Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=41)|
| 0:00:50| And I'm going to walk over here and sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=50)|
| 0:00:56| You could have told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=56)|
| 0:01:04| Well, this is going to be the short-lived chairman I resign to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| You've got to have somebody to run the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| You could have told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| Well, I guess I'll call to order the agenda meeting for the month of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=77)|
| 0:01:26| I think most of you have a copy of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| Are there any additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| I'd like to add that based on Chairman Moore's resignation that we, how would we put this on the agenda to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:46| officially make you the chairman for going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| Well, I think it would have to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| I mean, just put on the agenda that we should vote for that in the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=116)|
| 0:02:04| When will we vote on the chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Probably the next full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Yeah, we would like to add a consideration of a resolution for an operational audit of the medical examiner's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| with CPA firm Lewis H. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Are you going to sign a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| Here's Jolene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Is that who you live with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| I haven't given a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| They'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Yeah, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Is there anything else, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| I have one, the Responsible Vendors Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| There will be a resolution in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| The beer board voted on this and I want to add that to the agenda also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| Are there any other additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Yeah, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| I'm not sure how we would do this, but I'd like to make the proposal that we have our zoning meeting on a different day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| based on the new political realities of strict adherence to the sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| There's a lot more discussion than we've had in the past, and we've had several very, very long meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| and I think it might be beneficial if we separated and had the zoning meetings on a separate day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| from the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| You know, seven hours is just an awful long time to sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| and I don't think that we should cut our discussion short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| I think that we should continue to openly debate everything that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| I think that that's been as rocky as it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| I think that in the end it's going to be good for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| but I think it would also be good if we switched the zonings and the meetings to separate days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| so we don't have these long marathon meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Commissioner Lappert, I think that's something that will have to go to the rules committee for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| and I think Ivan has a meeting, I believe, this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Because we want to talk about changing the schedule of everything, so it will be in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Are there any deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| Is there anything that any commissioner wants to specifically talk about on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| Seeing nothing, this meeting is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080206agendameeting?start=272)|
