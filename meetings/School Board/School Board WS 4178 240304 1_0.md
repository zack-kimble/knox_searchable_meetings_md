| 0:02:36| business meeting to discuss items that come before us for consideration, so we would just ask you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=156)|

| 0:03:05| members of the board. This evening, I'd like to focus on some very encouraging news that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| received from the state. As you know, the Department of Education last month released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| district and school designations based on data from the 22-23 school year, and I'm proud to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| report that KCS made strong gains. 24 of our schools were honored with the reward school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| designation. This is the state's highest designation and recognizes schools that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| making gains in achievement and growth for all students across all student groups. That number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| reflects a significant increase up from only nine schools last year that earned that reward status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| The district's overall designation was satisfactory, reflecting significant progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| compared to the ranking of in need of improvement that we received last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| As I've said before, KCS will never be satisfied with being satisfactory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| but this is a huge step in the right direction for us. It's a statement to the hard work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| our teachers, our principals, and students over the last year, and I'm incredibly proud of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| efforts. These milestones are particularly exciting because they reflect a trend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| we're seeing in other data as well. For example, our TCAP scores released in 2023 for KCS showed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| gain of nearly five percent in third grade reading proficiency, reaching the highest level in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| district's history. The same assessment math proficiency grades six through eight rose by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| four percent. These scores serve as a powerful affirmation of our four priorities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| guiding our district's work, excellence in foundational skills, great educators in every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| school, career empowerment and preparation, and success for every student. I'm confident that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| this roadmap will continue to serve us well and help us stay focused on what's truly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| Also, I'd like to recognize that our growth is not possible on our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| and I'm grateful the way our entire community has joined forces to make those results possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| At our news conference two weeks ago, we were joined by some of our non-profit partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| including Boys and Girls Club, United Way, and YMCA. See my friend Matt Ryerson in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| crowd from United Way. Good to see you. I want to thank those organizations and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| countless other partners who have walked alongside us over the last year. Their engagement has had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| powerful impact, and I'm grateful for them. And again, I want to congratulate those 24 schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| and give our teachers, staff, principals, and students, thank them for their belief in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| direction and where we're headed. At this time, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Andrew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| Brown, who's joining us as the interim assistant superintendent of success. He's been on the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| for two weeks, and I would like to give him a few minutes to talk about his journey and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| important work to get here. Thank you, Dr. Roswick, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| To say that I was surprised when Dr. Roswick approached me a couple weeks ago would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| understatement. After spending 17 years at the school level as a principal, I didn't expect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| have a new job in eight months. However, as I've had time to reflect and really think about over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| the weekend, the new position that I had been placed in, I realized that those 17 years really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| served to prepare me for this role. As an educator, I always tried to focus on ways to break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| down barriers, and as I look at the work of the student success division, I believe that's exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| what we're here for. So I'm super excited to be a part of this work and to get to work with a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| group of people. And I've already hit the ground running. So in my first week, I met with all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| the important groups. I've met with the special ed council. I had great conversation in getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| to know them. I met with the region five principals. I've met with all of our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| within the division and all of our groups, and so really got off in a way that's helped me to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=398)|
| 0:06:46| successful throughout my career, and that's getting to know the people and build relationships to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| start doing the right work. So very excited about being a part of the student success division and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| getting to lead these great people. I will plan to share a bigger update on things going on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| our division later on this spring, but for today, I did want to share just really quickly an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| on one of the contracts that you all recently approved, which is our partnership with ESS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| for staffing in our special education division. We currently have staff in 44 schools. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| 84 active employees through ESS. We have 187 applicants that are in the hiring pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| ready to go, and with that current number, it takes approximately one week to fill a vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| once the request is received. So thank you all for the work that you've done in approving that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| and it is paying dividends for our students. So thank you, Dr. Eiswig. Thank you, Dr. Brown. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| just want to say, you know, he was shocked the day we talked about it. I think he was the only guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| who didn't know. We kind of talked about it as a team. I can remember in the conference room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| we were talking, and he got off the elevator smiling, and we could see him through the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| and I said, boy, his world's getting ready to change, but no, I do. I mean, it has been great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| for me. I've known Andrew for a long time as a principal, and the work he's done there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| transforming every school he's been at, if it was South Oil Middle School or if it was at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Central High School, and being able to work with him day by day over day for the last eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| and just him really getting a good taste for the work that we're doing and leading that forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| and to see him a very capable leader. We're excited for him to step in because he's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| stepping into two of our two of our big initiatives we have going on with our special education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| audit and deep dive and also our Region 5 plan, so looking for good things out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Madam Chair, with that concludes my report for the evening. Thank you, Dr. Reiswick. Dr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| I'm so excited for your new role in leadership. I've already heard good things from community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| folks out there, so welcome to this new role. You're going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| Oh, I'm sorry, Daniel. Thanks, Steve. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Dr. Reiswick. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| Dr. Brown. Congratulations. So this question is not reflective about you stepping into this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| but I know when it was first presented to the board it was an interim position. Dr. Reiswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| can you talk about any plans to whether or not you think you'll end up hiring that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| more permanently, and if so, I don't know policy procedure. I don't even know if Dr. Brown would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| be interested in it or not, but more curious to the long-term plan. I understand with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| short-term plan and I appreciate you stepping into it, so. Thank you, Mr. Watson. So maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| this is your public interview. No, I'm just kidding. No. I think kind of where Andrew and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| were with that, I mean, I always want to make sure that I'm making the right decision for the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| fit. Again, Andrew has those leadership qualities, and a lot of that gives us some time to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| see kind of if it's the right fit for him, the right fit for us, and the plans that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| going forward. And I would just say I'm very encouraged by what we've seen in the first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| weeks. I think his knowledge base of understanding where we're trying to go and what we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| do has been really evident. You know, I know even talking to his folks, I think he's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| found some things that he wants to try to improve on, and that, again, is the kind of leader that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| he is. So our work will stay the same. I'm hoping to make a decision, you know, fairly soon once I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| certain that that's the right way to go, if it's him or if we'd advertise it. Of course, that leaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| my position in my office vacant right now, so. Sure. Yeah, I'd like to hire that at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| too, so. Well, thank you for that point of clarification. I think that shows a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| wisdom. I always hate it when there's interim positions when there's no intention of keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| that person long term. To me, it's like, why did they step into it in the first place? And so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| idea of an interim really being a, hey, let's try this thing on, I think makes a lot of sense. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| who knows what goes on in the future, but I appreciate you being willing to step in and try it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| on, so. Okay, didn't want to miss anybody else. All right, Ms. Himmelgarn, I think you were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| to give us an update on the salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=646)|
| 0:10:57| Madam Chair, members of the Board, I am, but you are not only going to hear from me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| We have Evergreen Solutions here to present an overview of the salary study and initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| recommendations. I didn't turn it on. But I just want to reshare a few slides and then a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=669)|
| 0:11:20| of new ones from the quarterly work session. So we're very excited. I know that you all are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=680)|
| 0:11:28| We've been talking about the salary study, the compensation and classification study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| for a long time now, and we are almost done and almost ready to implement recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| I want to thank the Board again for allowing us the capacity and the budget to do this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| We did this study for several reasons. We entered into the contract with Evergreen for several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| reasons. Our people are our greatest asset. We wanted to identify best practices that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| leverage our compensation strategies to enhance recruitment and retention, create consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| in our job classifications and compensation throughout the district, determine market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| for our various jobs and where we compare to those, and then simplify our existing salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| structure for several reasons, primarily transparency to our current and potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| future employees. So as a reminder, we're doing that through the budget. We are doing priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| budgeting and aligning those with outcomes. As you all know, one of our four priorities is great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| educators in every school, and our intent is that the budget that we propose to you all in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| reflects that, that great educators are a priority. So before Evergreen comes up, I just want to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| an overview of what you'll hear from Evergreen today and then what you won't hear quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| So you will hear an overview of the compensation and classification study. You'll hear recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| regarding compensation and classification and an estimated cost of incorporating those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| recommendations. What you won't hear, what you won't receive today is the full proposed salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| schedule and where specific people and positions fall on that proposed salary schedule. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| we go over the next steps, that salary schedule will be coming at the April board meeting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| the board to approve. And the reason that it's not here quite yet is because we're still doing a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| of work in the budget to make room for that. So when we talked to you in January, we said that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| may be a phased in approach. Our intent is to incorporate all recommendations in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| That is the priority for us, and we are doing a lot of work as we talked about last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=822)|
| 0:13:50| to the budget to make sure that we can do that. So we will bring a proposed salary schedule to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| April board meeting, and then the results of that proposed salary schedule will be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| in the proposed budget that will be brought to the special called meeting at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| April. But then, of course, you all will have in your individual budget meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| If both are approved by the board, so the budget and the salary schedule, then the new schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| would be implemented beginning July 1, and then human resources will update all job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| as a result of that. We don't anticipate that the job descriptions could all be updated as of July 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| but all job descriptions will be updated as a result of the salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| So that's an overview. I will turn it over to Kristen Fitzpatrick with Evergreen Solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=875)|
| 0:14:43| to give her overview, and then we'll do questions at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| Welcome. Good evening. Thank you all for having me tonight. I'm excited to present this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| We've done a lot of work on this study, and it's kind of sad seeing it come to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| But my name is Kristen Fitzpatrick. I'm a senior consultant with Evergreen Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| and today I'd like to give you guys just an overview of our study, our study goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| what they were, the different phases of our project, as well as our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| So in looking at our study goals, we start by reviewing the current classification and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| compensation system in order to ensure that there's an appropriate alignment of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| internal positions. Then we also survey peer organizations to ensure market competitiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| with the end goal being to be able to provide you guys with some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| that do include that updated compensation and classification system in order to assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| in the recruitment and retention of employees. So our study actually kicked off in April of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| so we're almost a year into this. It actually, initially, if you'll remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| we started out as just being a compensation-only study, so there was no class piece involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| After we did the data collection, which included an employee database, salary schedule, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| benefits, job descriptions, org charts, policies, all of the good things, we quickly realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| we may need a little bit more to make this 100% successful. So when looking at the different phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=980)|
| 0:16:29| we start with that assessment of current conditions, and it was after that assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| of current conditions when we realized you guys may need some work on your classification system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| so let's talk about that. So thank you for allowing the district to also do that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| I think that is going to be so important moving forward. Once we did the assessment of current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| conditions, and I'm going to talk about these more in depth, we move into the market survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| We also released what we call our job assessment tool, and then we did an employee outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| So the job assessment tool and the employee outreach were part of our internal review of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| organization. The market survey was part of that external review. And then, of course, we provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| you guys with some recommendations. So in our assessment of current conditions, this is where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| are looking at all of the data that was submitted to us, so all of the employee data, the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| descriptions, the salary schedules, everything. So what we found were a couple of, we'll call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:31| pink flags, I won't call them red flags just yet, but we did see that you guys had multiple pay plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| You had 11 plans that were organized by classifications, and then six that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| organized by grades with the classifications assigned to each grade. So when I say classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| I'm talking job titles. We also noticed that amongst those plans were some varying, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| very narrow range spread at the grade and or classification level. Now, best practice is a range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| spread between 50 to 70 percent, and when I say range spread, I mean that's your earning potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| That is that percentage increase from the minimum of the scale to the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| So like I said, best practice, 50 to 70 percent. Some of your skills, like I said, were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| less than that, much less than that. We also noted some potential compression, and when I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| compression, I'm really talking about salaries that are a little bit too close for comfort, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| that is amongst your new versus your tenured employees, or between employees and their supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| So going back to the employees, the new versus tenured employees, when we're looking at that, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| can see that sometimes some newer employees were hired in or brought in at a higher rate than some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| of your long-term employees. Now, what's wrong with that? Well, it tends to increase, you know, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| cause morale issues, which can lead to retention issues. And then moving to more of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| supervisor versus employee role or part, best practices. You typically want, you know, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| employee not to be earning more than 80 percent of the supervisor's salary. So if you can see on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| the slide here, you had 30 percent of employees who were receiving an administrative supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| that were earning more than that 80 percent mark. 17 of those employees were earning more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| their supervisor. So these were some of the things that, as we were looking at the data, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| knew that we wanted to try to address. And also, going back to the new versus tenured employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:42| throughout the salary quartiles, as you know, when we break those up into four pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| we typically expect for the tenure to increase as the quartile increases. And overall, that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| taking place. However, it wasn't always the case at the individual grade or classification level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| So we could see areas of compression in certain places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| So since this started out as a compensation-only study, we moved into beginning the market survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:14| Now, you'll notice that there are going to be, I have some dates in here, and some things overlap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| and that's because we're like, well, we need to, we need some more information there. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| beginning the market survey, we have on the, as you can see on the presentation, there are 20 peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1223)|
| 0:20:30| there. And these are the peers that we contacted for your salary and benefits survey. So 20 peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| that's what we recommend. In order for us to be able to use the data that is collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| there needs to be at least five data points per benchmark. So that 20 number allows us wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| Like I said, 20 peers is what's recommended there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Going into the actual market survey, the classifications that we used as benchmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| we had 108 on our list. Now, you guys have way more than 108 different classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| but what we tried to do in this case is to just use positions as benchmarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| meaning we're not going to include every single position due to the fact that every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| district does not have positions that would translate over into yours. So we tried to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| the ones that we knew that we'd be able to get the best matches for. We don't match on title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| we match on job descriptions. So where I have the title, you guys had some titles that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| kind of generic, so it's like, well, we need to narrow that down. So we had 108 on the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:44| We were able to collect 895 data points, and we refinalized these results in December of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| Now, when we are looking at the market information, we are talking about salary ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| not individual employees' salaries, so just the salary ranges, the minimum to the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| So as you can see, on average, the district was 8.9% below the market minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| 7.7% below the market midpoint, and 7.6% below the market maximum. Some of your peers had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:20| different range spreads, so they may have had wider range spreads than you, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| kind of throws that 8.9%. It's kind of different from the midpoint and the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| It could be also that your peers are updating their minimum as they update their max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:41| So there's a few different reasons for that varying number. Now, whenever I refer to market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| from this point on, I am referring to the midpoint because we consider midpoints to be market due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| those varying range spreads that your peers do have. We want to know what is that middle number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| that people are really focused on in the different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| So while we also collected salary information, we are also collecting information on your benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| So the major findings of the benefits survey, you guys were on par with peers when we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| benefits as a percentage of total compensation. So your percentage of total compensation was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| 25%, peers was approximately 24.8%. When it comes to health insurance, it was noted that the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:34| was covering a lower portion of employee-only and employee plus child premiums. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| you guys were covering a higher percentage of the employee plus spouse and family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| premiums than the peers. So you can see those numbers on the screen and those are respective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| So 77.5 would be employee-only for Knox, 68.8 would be employee plus child, so on and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| and that's how it is for peers. As far as your contribution towards retirement, you guys did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| have a higher overall contribution. Keep in mind that we used peers from different states as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| that were similar to Knox County, so that's why you can sometimes see that varying percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| point as well. As far as the sick leave and personally, that was pretty comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Small, small, small difference like 0.2. The big thing was the annual and vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| leave was higher than the peers, so the minimum accrual for annual and vacation leave for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| County was 8, whereas peers was 6.6 hours per month, and then the maximum accrual was 13.36| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| for Knox County schools, whereas peers was 7.8. So kudos to you guys for offering more leave time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| that is always important to educators, especially speaking as a former educator myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| The next portion of our, our next phase of our study was the job assessment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| So we released this in September of 2023. We encouraged employees to provide input on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| various roles and responsibilities within the organization. This is really how we are able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| determine where that position should fall on a salary scale. There were select employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| received the assessment tool, and that was just based on, you know, the positions that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| more information on. Your employee completion rate, we actually had, our goal is 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| completion for every single district. We only, we want 50 percent completion. You guys exceeded that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| by 57, you guys had 57 percent completion, and that represented almost 62 percent of all of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| classification. So that was, we were very happy with that number as well. After the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| portion and supervisor review portion of these assessments, that's where our part kind of came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| and so we analyzed each submission to determine if a reclassification was needed, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| that internal alignment amongst those positions. So we wanted to make sure that positions that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| performing had similar roles, responsibilities, those level of risk, that they were, they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| compensated similarly. So after the job assessment tool, or while that was actually going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:30| that is where my colleague and I actually got to come up and meet with some of your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| and discuss some of their concerns. So we held on-site focus groups and interviews mid-October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| that included a cross-section of your employee classifications, and we had 22 total sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Now we also released an outreach survey to all of your employees. This was, like I said, sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| to everyone. They had a week or two to, you know, take the survey. It was anonymous, just to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| us some additional feedback. We like to give everyone the opportunity to be part of the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| you know, while they can't maybe attend a focus group due to scheduling, you know, we want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| to have that opportunity. We got over 3,000 survey responses, so that's about 50 percent participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| there, which is amazing. Like I said, in any district we want, whether it's the job assessment tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| whether it's a survey, anything, we want about 50 percent participation, so we were very happy with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| that. We got a lot of really good information from them. One of the first things that we ask in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| focus groups or even on the survey is, why come work for Knox County Schools? What is it about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| district? Why choose this district? Why not go to somewhere else? Many of them cited the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:45| their relationships with co-workers, the students and community, and their impact on the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| they have is why they stay here, why they came here and why they stay here. Now these next slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| I just do want to reiterate that these are perceptions of the employees and not evergreen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| so just make that clear. We asked them about classification concerns. So one of the main things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| that we heard was that the job titles and descriptions do not accurately reflect their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| roles and responsibilities, and a lot of that was due to the fact that you guys had some pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| generic titles across different departments. So you may have the same title, but they do very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| very, very different things depending on that department that they are in. We also heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| there was limited opportunities for career advancement. You know, these are things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| are not uncommon to hear, but that is, those were the two main things as far as classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| You know, everyone's favorite topic is always compensation. So, you know, on that survey there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| a lot of questions about compensation, and of course that's what a lot of our conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| and focus group revolve around. So on the survey there was a question that asked, you know, on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| scale of one to ten, how would you rate your satisfaction with your overall compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Employees on average gave it a 3.9. So below average. In focus groups it was repeated over and over that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:14| compensation was not keeping up with the cost of living in Knox County, and also retention issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| were brought up time and time again, and employees felt that that was due to the low compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| Many of your employees are having to work multiple jobs because they cannot afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| to survive on just the salary they receive currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| We also ask employees about benefits in these groups. On a scale of one to ten, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| their overall satisfaction was a five, so right there in the middle. The largest area of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| was the medical insurance costs in relation to the low salaries. So it wasn't necessarily that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| you know, that it just was outrageous cost. It was, compared to what they are bringing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| it was too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| The last question in the survey asked, what are the employees' top priorities for this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:12| As you can see here, of the 3,000 responses that we had, 2,442 said competitive compensation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| market peers. They also said adjusting compensation to account for the high cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| And then 1,046 said adjusting the benefits offered to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| So after all of this information is gathered, we've had a chance to do our internal as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| as external review. That's where we want to start thinking about, okay, what are our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| recommendations going to be? When we build out this new system, what are some things that we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| consider? One of those being that we wanted to base the plan being competitive at the market average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| We wanted you guys to have the best chance of recruiting and retaining your employees as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| possible. The other thing we wanted to consider was to condense that number of scales for consistency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| transparency, and ease of management. Another thing that was mentioned over and over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| in focus groups was that employees had no idea how salaries were compensated, how salaries were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| determined, how it was determined what scale you were on, why am I on this scale versus this scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| whenever I do this job and it falls under this. So we wanted to kind of just simplify things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| So I have for you two proposed salary plans. The first we're going to talk about is your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| certified plan. You can see here there are now two grades instead of, I believe you had five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| So we have condensed this down into one for a bachelor's degree and one for a master's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| You'll also notice that the proposed minimum is a little over 47,000. So this is putting you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| track to be at the 50,000 by the 26-27 school year. All previous grades, your master's plus 30, EDS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:08| PhD, they were eliminated. Those employees were placed on CERT-2 and they would receive an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| education supplement. So I also have on this slide those supplement amounts. So we wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| sure that no one would be losing money. So this does take into account how you were going from five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:32| grades down to two. We also built in a retention increase or a retention strategy within the steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:42| So every 5, 10, at steps 5, 10, 15, and 20, that employee would receive a larger step increase as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| a retention strategy. So you will see whenever you guys do see the full plan, you will notice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| that is a large jump at those steps. Like I said, that is built in as a retention strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1976)|
| 0:33:10| So what about all the other employees? So we are going from, what was that, 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| scales down to two. Everyone else would be on this, what we are calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| just a general plan. So this is all employees other than your teachers, your librarians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| your counselors. So there are 40 grades. There are 21 steps. Same as the teacher scale, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| are 21 steps on that as well. This is going to provide a flat rate between the steps instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| a percentage increase. This is going to give employees a more consistent increase rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| the smaller increases on the front end and larger on the back end. So they are able to progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| through that range more appropriately. So your midpoint is not being pushed out to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| 16. It is literally step 10 on this one. This does include a 4% increase in between each grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2036)|
| 0:34:05| In the report that will be coming, you will see that referred to as the midpoint progression. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| in between each of these grades is 4% between the midpoints. So from one grade to the other, it is 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| This will eliminate your administrative supplement scale. That was a big one in focus groups. People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| did not understand that scale. The math behind it. I joke that I will have a PhD in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:29| school salary schedules by the end of this. So this goes away. The administrative supplement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| scale, all of that is built into this new scale. Positions that were previously based off of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| certified scale would now receive that education stipend for any degree above a master's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| And this is going to provide you plenty of room for growth in order to avoid the compression that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| you guys are currently facing and that you may face as the district grows. So on this, you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| see we go to grade 140. However, grades 136 through 140 are currently unoccupied by any positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| So as you do need to slot in more classifications or you need to move positions around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| you have that room to do so. So once we had determined how we wanted to structure the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:25| built out the plan, the next step was to determine some implementation options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| And this is going to be based off of after seeing the data, after talking to employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| what did we think was going to be best? Going back to speaking about the compression that your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| employees faced outside of your teacher scale, outside of those folks, we knew that we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| to provide an implementation that would address those things. So class year parity, this option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| is going to look at how long your employee has been in their current position and place them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| on the scale appropriately. So this is going to help alleve some of that compression between your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| new and tenured employees as well as help with your employee to supervisor compression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| which is also addressed in how this grades are set up. So class year parity is based on a 20-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:26| career trajectory. If you have an employee with 10 years of experience, they would be placed at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| the midpoint, which is around grade 10. And if you had an employee with 20 or more years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| experience, they would be placed at the max. Your employee, that salary is configured and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| employee is moved to the next closest step that matches that because we know that numbers never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| are completely aligned and we're not going to recommend decreasing anyone's pay. Employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| that were earning more than what we would project were just moved to the next closest step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| And then the other option that we threw out there for your certified staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| was the current step plus one based on state requirements. So they are placed on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| current step and then we just add a step to them so that they are still falling in line with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| state guidelines. So the price tag. You will see that we have this broken down into three groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:24| and we have our reasoning. So keep in mind administrative is included on the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| but we did break that out separately. So you're looking at around 39 million and that does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| include benefits. I believe we said that with benefits it would be somewhere around 41, 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| something like that. So for your certified teachers, obviously we're recommending step plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| one. That's the goal is based on their experience or overall experience that's coming in at 28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| million. And then your general and administrative is coming in around 11 million. And we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| class year parity for those to address the compression that is taking place in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| employees. Our other recommendations, obviously going in and implementing those two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:16| We've already slotted the classifications into the plan based on that. So if you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| do approve it, that's already done for you. We've already transitioned the employee salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| onto those plans. So our recommendations outside of doing that, moving forward, we would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| that you all conduct some small scale salary surveys as needed to address that market competitiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| for positions that you're having a hard time recruiting and retaining. And make those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| to the pay grade assignments as necessary. The file that we've handed over to HR, it's very user,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| I say very user friendly. It's got things that have a handle on it. But that is something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| do recommend as you are having those problems. We do recommend conducting another one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| studies or a study like this every three to five years just because of how quickly the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| changes. Review and revise as appropriate your existing pay practice guidelines for how you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:15| determining salaries, how you're moving, promoting, transferring. And then of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| reviewing and revising your job descriptions to include those updated classification information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| And we do have that information that we are providing to you all from the job assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| tool that will help you update those descriptions. We also recommend updating or reviewing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:37| annually and updating as needed. Questions? Anyone have any questions? Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you so much. This is very, very beneficial. So one question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| we've heard in the past, and you probably addressed it, although I'm just not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| is the current salary scale goes up to 20 years for employees. So there wasn't an increase to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| their base salary after that. Is the recommendation that we, does this take into account that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| So that's one of our recommendations going back to that last one, or sorry, the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| the review and revise as appropriate your existing pay practice guidelines. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| something that you guys would need to discuss. Do you want to include some sort of longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| incentive for those that do reach the max? Now when we were looking at your market peers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| on average folks had about 20 steps. So that is becoming the new trend is decreasing the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| of steps instead of increasing for folks to continue getting that step increase. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| Okay. Thank you. Is that the same question? Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| several questions. One is, will we receive both presentations? I don't think we received either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:07| Miss Himmelgarn's or Evergreen's. There was a lot to chew on. Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| Okay. That would be great. And then I know in general, you know, we don't anticipate anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| having pay decreased. Is there a chance that an individual is going to have reduced pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| No. Okay. So it will not affect any individual negatively? It will not. Everyone at the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| least will be moved to the next closest step. So the next highest step. So they may receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| three dollars, but we're not going to decrease them down to a lower pay at all. Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Good. Thank you. I'm sure people would appreciate hearing that. Oh, absolutely. So that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| So you spoke a lot about the market study and then the impacts of that related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| step increases and the 20 classes. I didn't hear much about, was there anything in the market study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| related to COLA increases and what is seen out in the market in terms of how people do that? And is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| there any recommendations for us to consider? I know one of my concerns over time is just doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| flat percentage rate increases all the time. All it does is create a larger and larger spread from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| your lower employees to your highest paid employees. Is there any recommendations coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| out of your work around COLA? So there will be in the final report and that kind of goes back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| your existing pay practice guidelines and we'll give you some further insight on that. But typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| whenever you do provide a COLA, you want to provide it to the range. So people are automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| getting that COLA and then whenever you move them to the next step, they're getting that little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| extra because you don't ever want to give just a COLA and nothing else because folks would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| never move through the range. Right. There would be no salary progression through the range and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| that is not best practice. You want to continue moving them through the range. So if you're only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| giving three, four percent COLA, you would still want to continue moving folks through the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Right, thank you. And then I think my next two questions are actually for Ms. Simmelgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| I don't know if you want to get up there or talk from there, wherever. I mean I'm sure other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| have questions for you as well. But you mentioned that we will be asked to approve the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| schedule ahead of the budget. So to me, I mean they have to do significantly with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| and the thought of approving a salary schedule that has significant impact on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| when you just told us that you all are having to do a lot of work to see how do we even fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| this thing in. I don't know necessarily a better way to do it, but I feel a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| I don't feel like it's, I'm curious what's behind that decision to ask us to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| because it seems like we could get into a situation where we pass a salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| and then somehow regret it. Not that we've done the thing with the salary schedule, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| we didn't know what impact it was going to have yet. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| It does, Mr. Watson. And we had that same conversation, kind of like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| the fund balance conversation we had several weeks ago. Where does it fall on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| What happens first? We would not, and the reason we don't have the proposed salary schedule today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| the reason that it would be in April, is that we would not bring that unless we felt comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| that in the proposed budget we could incorporate the salary schedule. So if the board prefers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:30| we could do those closer in time than meeting and special called meeting. I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| salary schedule would need to come before budget. I agree, because if you approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| then you, in effect, you've approved the salary schedule. I agree with that in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| needs to come first. I think some of it is the timing. I guess my question is when it comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| April, how much information will you all be able to share in terms of its impact on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| in its entirety? I know we're not being necessarily asked to approve a budget at the exact same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| but I do want to know the implications of it. Right, so when we when we bring the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| salary schedule, that would be where specific positions fall, and this $39 million would become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| a specific number, not an estimate, that it would be about that much. But we won't necessarily in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| that April meeting understand, I mean, the pot's not going to grow, right? The recommended or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| the forecasted amount of how much money we're going to have is not going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| whether or not we do the salary schedule or not, right? We're still going to have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| dollar amount. Correct. And so if we approve this, we know it costs $39. I guess what I'm asking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| in April, are we going to have some idea of what we're not going to spend $39 on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| Right, because you have to, I mean, unless I'm wrong, it's a trade-off is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| Yes. Probably a good one, I would assume, I just don't know yet. And quite honestly, we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| we are working, this has become a priority for us. We think that this is a huge opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| for the district, for the board to show our employees the value that we place on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| So we have to start, if this is going to happen by July 1, we do have to start moving in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| direction yesterday to make sure that that pay is as close to accurate as possible for that July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| paycheck. I will say that if we move in that direction, there probably will be some growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| pains in that July month because it's a huge undertaking to move 9,000 people to a new salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| schedule. But yes, yes, the answer is yes. If we have made room for it in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:45| then we should, we would know when we've made room for it, where that money's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| like where. But will we know how we're going to make room for it at the same time we're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| asked to approve the salary schedule? That's my real, do you see what I'm saying? Like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| and I'm not trying to be nitpicky, I'm just saying like that's a critical point of decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| for me as a board member at least to know what I'm giving up in doing it. My guess is I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| to want to. I don't know, I mean I've been very for the study and I think we need to do all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| things. That's just to me a big decision to make when I don't understand the implications of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| decision when I'm being asked to make it. That's where I'm kind of like getting tripped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| Right, and it's a very, it's a very valid question, very valid point. We will have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| individual board meetings, budget meetings. Prior to the April meeting, salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| meeting? I believe that the tentative schedule is the first week in April, so I believe. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| so at least as an individual board member, I'm going to have a conversation about the larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| budget. Right. Okay, that helps a lot. Yep, thank you. So here's my last question for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| Ms. Imelgarn. To me this is paradigm shifting. Absolutely. I could be wrong, maybe I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| overstating it, and to me it's probably one of the most consequential decisions I'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| had the privilege of helping make in my four-year tenure on the board. I don't feel like I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| nearly enough information and I'm not faulting anybody, like I get all the things. What I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| asking for is, is there a way for us, I don't know who all on the board be interested in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| to do a deeper dive on this between now and April, outside of me just coming to your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| and sitting down and you like taking me through it. Is there a way for us to get a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| detailed, and I think you did a fantastic job, I'm not saying that you didn't, I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| to me, there's a lot of levers here and I just would want to know if you all thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| is there any kind of opportunity to, whether it's a special call meeting or not, I'm not sure how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| the rest of the board is feeling, but I mean this impacts every single one of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| and not just now, but for a long term. When's the last time we made a significant adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| to the salary schedule? Right. 20-something years, right? This is probably a 20-year decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| is my point, so is there any thought about that? We would, yeah, I mean, yes, I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| we have anything planned. Right, yeah, I'm not suggesting we do, I'm just saying I personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| as an individual board member, would love to figure out a way to do a little bit of a deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| dive and if that's just me, that's fine, but my guess is there might be more of us who would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| to try to figure that out. Okay. So, thank you. Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Could you help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:33| me understand how the administrative supplement scale is going away and are all supplement scales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| going away? Yes, almost. I'll take your first question first. So, right now, we have, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| take a sample employee, so a principal, we have a teacher base and then a supplement, so there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| would, we wouldn't look at two different scales to come up with that principal pay, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| just be on the second example, if we can go back to, on the second example of the grades 101 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:08| 140, principal would fall in line on just one of those grade bands and Kristen is much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| better one to explain this. So, it's actually going to be on this one. So, I would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| go back and actually look at the file to tell you which grade, because it's going to depend on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| it's an elementary school, is it a middle school, is it a high school principal, but what we did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| we wanted to, one, make sure that we're, obviously, we're not decreasing anyone's pay, but whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:40| you, in order to get the the true minimum to max of what a principal can make, we had to combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| those two scales anyway. So, essentially, what we did was we combined it to determine what is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| true minimum, what is that true max, and then obviously looking at the market, looking at job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| assess, like all the things, we slotted them in appropriately on this scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| So, we merged the two where you had the certified and you had the administrative supplement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| we merged those together and that is where you get just the one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:19| Yeah, absolutely. I'll add a piece on your second question. Will this eliminate all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| our supplements? I think the answer to that is no. If it is not a duty for a full contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| link, we would still have supplements. So, our athletic supplements, for example, would still exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| separate from this. Okay, my next question would be, when you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:49| an employee whose pay might be higher than a supervisor, will that still occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| So, the way that the plan is set right now, there should be enough room in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:05| whenever we're doing our career progression. So, whenever we're looking at the career progression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| we made sure that there was enough room in the scale to account so that that would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| necessarily take place. Now, if the employee is earning overtime, can I definitively say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| that absolutely will not happen? No, because we don't know how much overtime they're going to earn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| things like that. So, let's say that we are looking at an administrator who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| maybe at step 10 and an employee at step 20 with a doctorate and a supplement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:41| then I would expect that person to be making higher than the administrator. Will that still happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| That would, we would have to do a further analysis to definitively determine that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| but once again, the way that the schedule is placed is that there should be enough room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| so that that does not happen, or at least it eases some of that that is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| Thank you. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to dig into that question a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:15| you mentioned that there were 17, I think, individuals who are currently in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| I'm sure it's probably different for those 17, but is some of that being caused by what Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| just articulated, that some of them it's because of their educational level and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| or is it the way I first heard you say it, I thought, oh, that means some of our supervisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| are not being paid nearly enough. A little bit of both. So, it's a little bit of both, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| But in theory, I mean, I know you have to do further analysis. There is a chance that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| probably have some employees, potentially. This doesn't eliminate the fact that you could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| some additional compensation because of education and other things like that, correct? Right. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| does this plan to completely eliminate all of your compression? I would feel comfortable saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| not 100% of it, but we are going to be able to move away from the majority of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| Yeah. And then, Ms. Semelgaard, you had mentioned that when you spoke to us earlier in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| that you had talked about probably phasing this in, but then at the beginning of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| talked about wanting to try to get this all done in one. Is that because the financial impact isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| as great as maybe we thought? We think, man, we can really do it? Or is there other strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| reasons why we feel like we want to try to knock it out in one swing? So, $40 million is a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:44| money, so I will not say that it was not. It's a lot to me. Yes, it is. But. It is not that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| saw that number and thought that we have that capacity currently in the budget without doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| a lot of work. We saw that the budget team did a great job last year of strategically budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3297)|
| 0:55:06| some large amounts of money in non-recurring costs, and we saw how close we were with some more work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:16| to doing this for all of our employees, to showing all of our employees that they are the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| Our people are who carry out our mission every day, and so being able, being very close to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| able to do this for all employees at the same time, once we realized that it was within sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| it became a priority, and our departments are going back and revisiting budgets. Maybe because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| of my question earlier, I'm kind of putting the cart before the horse a little bit, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| you know, we've already had some conversation in our preliminary budget talks about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| the percentage from TISA is going to be significantly less the increase year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| Even if we think we can get this in this year, and I know you all are working really hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| make that happen, is there anything right now that causes any kind of pause or concern for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| I mean, adding salaries is one of the hardest things to do, because you got to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| adding employees, but also increasing salaries, because you got to continue to maintain that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| right? And again, don't hear me wrong. I'm not advocating. I'm not advocating against this. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| just trying to, I think it's an important question, is as you all are thinking and forecasting out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| do we see any potential pitfalls in future years? I don't know that I would call them pitfalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3384)|
| 0:56:32| but the answer is yes. This doesn't just impact next year. It impacts future years, and it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| the increases that we have traditionally given in the past, it makes those significantly more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| expensive to do on an ongoing basis. So this isn't just a commitment for next year. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| multi-year commitment and a multi-year commitment in the budget process to making this a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| So the answer is I don't know that I would call them pitfalls. Mr. McPherson may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| expand on that. It's not a good accounting term. Right. It does create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| a larger commitment for us in the future to give increases. Yes. But I think that's a good word. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| mean, if we do this, it's a commitment, right? Right. And in lots of different connotations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| it's a commitment, and I think that's an important message. So, yeah. And to add to that, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| like to say in my past experience with multi-year implementation, they often find themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| districts often find themselves, by the end of that three-year period, having to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| redo the whole thing because now you're behind the market. Oh, I like one year a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| Yeah, absolutely. I commend you all. Way, way better. Way better. Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:50| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to just throw something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Around 2011-2012, this board and the administration discussed asking County Commission for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3475)|
| 0:58:05| additional $35 million. And at that time, we didn't have a lot of community support for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| because the reasoning was very unclear. I think this is very clear reasoning that the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:20| could get behind. So, I'd like to just throw that out there that maybe that's something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| want to think about before we look at cutting things. Maybe we need to look at asking for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| amount. Thank you. Do we have any other questions or discussion? Thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:43| It's very beneficial, much needed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Hummelgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:53| All right, next on our agenda, Ms. Lautner. I think you're up next to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| Oh, and Dr. Wysak, are you going to take the podium as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:17| All right, Madam Chair, members of the board. Last month, if you recall, we had a pretty good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| discussion around data usage in the district and some very specific conversations around how are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| we using our data? What are we using our data to help inform? And specifically, what are we looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:40| at as it relates to discipline data? And so, this evening, in response to some of the requests that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| we received last month, we'd like to do three things with you all. First, take a look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| data points that are available in the district, how we are using those data points to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| student outcomes, and finally, spend some time contextualizing the discipline data that's at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| our disposal and how we are using that on a regular basis as well. And so, with that in mind, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| start by talking a little bit about what we monitor and what we report on. There's some crossover here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| but there is some difference. So, what we're monitoring on a regular basis at the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| level are what we can call indicators of success. So, these are metrics that are used to predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| outcomes or assess the impact our strategies or initiatives are having on the learning taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| place in the classroom. Now, the crosswalk there is that we're predicting the outcomes we plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| report on as a result of the objectives that we've set for ourselves in our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| So, some examples of those indicators of success could include anything from benchmark data. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| those are some of those predictive assessments our students are taking over the course of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| year. We're looking at whether or not students are on track for proficiency in ELA and math and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| science and all of those testable areas. We're looking at walkthrough data. What are we seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| in our classrooms? Are we seeing what we expect? If we're not, are we deploying supports to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| ourselves back on track so that we can see what we expect to see or what we would like to see in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| those classroom areas? We're looking at behavior. What's happening in our students' lives? What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| trends are we seeing and are we intervening appropriately to make sure that students have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| every opportunity to remain in the classroom and to continue to reap the benefit of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| instruction that's taking place in that space? And so, as we are monitoring, we're monitoring with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| the intention of meeting some very specific objectives. We've established those objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| for ourself through the annual action plan that board adopted document at the beginning of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| year. And so, we use that annual action plan to define what at the district level we need and want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| to be true to continue to move forward, to continue to improve outcomes for our students. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:54| that's what we're reporting on an annual basis. And you'll hear in just a moment that beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| this year, we'd actually like to begin reporting on our progress made around that document on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| biannual basis. So, you'll actually start hearing more from us beginning this year in regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| those measurable and milestone objectives that we've established for ourselves. Before we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| I want to ask a big question. And I feel like this should be kind of obvious, but when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| talking about data, an obvious question to ask is why monitor data, right? The easy answer is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| we have to. There are multiple state and federal grants and laws that require ongoing and regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| data monitoring and reporting on metrics that include anything from chronic absenteeism to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| third grade ELA proficiency to our participation rate in the ACT to our graduation rates throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| the district. That's the we have to answer. And that's a valid answer. But more deeply than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| we're monitoring data on a regular basis because we want to. So, at KCS, we want to monitor data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| because we're using those data points to drive real-time decisions in our classroom, in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| district, in our schools to help meet our established objectives and to make sure that students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| learning and they're meeting their own goals that they've established for themselves. All right. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| big question. How do we use data to improve student outcomes? First and foremost, as with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| everything else that we do, this should look really familiar by now, we are using our data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:24| that we have at our disposal through the lens of our four priorities. We're making sure that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| monitoring those indicators of success as they relate to excellence and foundational skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| to great educators in every school, to career empowerment and preparation, and for success for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| every student so that we can make sure that we are on track to meet our goal of graduating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| every student in the district ready to succeed in the future of their choosing, be that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| enrollment in a post-secondary institution, enlistment in the military, or employment in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| high-wage, high-demand career field. At Knox County Schools, I will say that we are uniquely fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| to exist in such a data-rich environment. So, we have a pretty vast data ecosystem. We have a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| of data points at our disposal, and we have a lot of data users throughout the district. So, on a daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| basis, anyone from our superintendent of schools, Dr. Reiswick, to our district leadership team, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| our regional directors and supervisors, to our principals and their school teams, to our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| in the classroom and our students in their desk, are using data on a regular basis to identify goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| for themselves, track whether or not they're en route to meet those goals, and then reflect on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| whether or not they met those goals and how or why. So, when we exist in such a data-rich environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| one thing we have to consider is that there's also this potential for noise. And so, data without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| context, it's just a dot, right? It's just noise. So, one of the goals of both the strategy division and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| also one of our goals here today is to connect those dots, to make sure that we are putting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| most actionable, most relevant data points in front of the most appropriate users to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| are moving the needle to meet those established goals. It starts to sound really nebulous without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| examples, so we're going to get into some examples. Speaking of, we're really looking at connecting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| dots, connecting our data users to data points at three levels throughout the district. So, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| talking about the district level, we're talking about the school level, but we're also talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| about what's happening at the student level. So, if we start at the district level first, our primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| data users are probably our superintendent of schools, Dr. Reiswick, and our district leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| team. Our district leadership team consists of the five assistant superintendents and all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| direct reports. So, on a regular basis, we are looking at some pretty high-level data points to assess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| kind of the overall health and well-being and status of the district. That could be anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| from staffing data. Where are vacancies? Are we seeing hot spots? Are we seeing areas that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| difficult to fill? If we are, are retention and recruitment efforts working? Once we fill vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| is that fill rate sustaining? So, what are we seeing in that staffing data space? We're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| student outcomes data. So, are the initiatives that we're funding, are the strategies that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:31| leveraging meeting the goals they were intended to make or to meet? We're also looking at facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=3991)|

| 1:06:56| data that we're looking at at the district level, but it does give you kind of a snapshot and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| example of the type of data points that we're looking at at the district level with a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| specific intent of driving our budgeting and resourcing decisions. That's a very relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4025)|

| 1:07:25| students. If we drill down a level deeper to our school data, we're talking about data users at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4045)|

| 1:07:49| schools. We're talking about our principals and they're looking at, on a regular basis, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| from benchmark data, those predictive assessments. Are students on track? Are we seeing the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| rate of skill acquisition to put students on a path toward proficiency in a given content area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| We're looking at that walkthrough data. Are we seeing the materials usage that we would anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| in the classroom? Are we hearing the types of questions that we want to hear in the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| Are we seeing the level of engagement we want to see in the classroom? We're looking at discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| data, you know, so what's happening at a school level? Are there areas of concern? Do we see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| whole lot of concern in a cafeteria in a given school? And if so, have we moved staff to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| area to help supervise that space? So we're looking at these very, I wouldn't say high level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| data points, but higher level data points than what you're going to see at the classroom level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| to diagnose what's happening at the school level. Is every school in the best possible position to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| meet their established goals to drive support and intervention? Do we need to deploy some district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4125)|

| 1:08:56| supports to specific classrooms? What are we doing in the intervention space? Are there scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| decisions that need to be made? If we see an uptick in need for some RTI time in a classroom, if we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| a lot of students in need of some small group intervention, do we need to make some changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| the master schedule next year to allow for more capacity to provide for that intervention time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| So all of these school level decisions are again, and this is the constant theme, being made to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:27| and improve student outcomes. And we can drill even deeper. So if we go one level deeper, we land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4167)|
| 1:09:35| at the student level data. And this is really where we see the most room for impact, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| This is, these are data users consisting of our school teams. So that's everything from our PLCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4181)|

| 1:10:12| and just needs a, you know, a little word of support? These are our whole child support teams. You're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| going to hear a lot about those in just a moment, who are looking at, are there barriers to learning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| What obstacles or challenges are our students facing that we can help mitigate, that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| help bridge the gap for so that students are ready and able to learn when they walk into the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| We're talking about our teachers. We're talking about our students also looking at data in real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| time in the classroom to make some very real, very tangible, very relevant decisions around their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| own instruction and their own learning in the classroom. So the types of data points they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| using are everything from grades on pop quizzes, informal assessments, tests, to behavior trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| Is someone just having a really rough week and maybe do they need a little extra support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| or, you know, an opportunity to kind of just unpack with somebody outside of the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| space? They're looking at attendance data. Do we have a student that maybe has missed the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| same block of instruction for two weeks in a row now? And what are we doing to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| we can bridge that gap to get that student back in front of the instruction and the learning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| we want to be taking place, that we want that student to have access to? So we're using all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| of that student-level data to drive a lot of the same things but in a very specific way at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| school and the classroom level in particular, to drive instruction, to drive support and intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| specifically for our individual students. And we're looking at that classroom and student-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| decision making to, once again and most relevantly here, drive and impact student outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| So that's a very, very quick sprint through the various layers of data that we are using on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:59| regular basis and who's engaging with those data points on a regular basis. I could start putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| a lot of bar graphs up on the screen but we'd be here for a very long time. We're going to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| some very specific data points here in just a minute. But before we do that, I do just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| come back to reporting on our progress because we've been, we've at least tried to be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| intentional in what it is we're reporting on and when we're reporting on that progress. So some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| these needles don't move as quickly as others. When we're talking about benchmark data, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| talking about academic learning, you may see some changes on a quarterly basis but you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| necessarily seeing changes that are comparable from one quarter to the next. So when we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| talking about reporting on results, the best cadence we've been able to land on is a semesterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| reporting structure. So beginning last year, early this year actually, we published our very first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| annual report. So this was our report out on those milestone and measurable objectives that we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| for ourselves in the annual that you all approved for us. In the annual action plan this year, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| would like to report out at a slightly more frequent cadence. So in addition to publishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| an annual report on our results in October, next month we would like to bring you a progress report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| on the strategies that we are using on whether or not, you know, we're on track in all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| established goals, whether or not we're a little bit off track and if we are, what are we doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| about it right now. And so you all can be on the lookout for that first progress report from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| next month. And then we will follow with our second edition of the KCS annual report in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:41| And part of what inspired, I believe, this conversation last month was this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| around discipline data. What do we have? What are we using? How does it fit into how we're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| the needle and supporting the learning that's taking place in our classrooms? And so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| not a very quick answer to unpack, but it is an answer that we wanted to tackle here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| So I'm briefly going to turn it back over to Dr. Reiswick to talk a little bit about his philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| as it relates to discipline. Thank you, ma'am. It's different from this seat. I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| is it weird for you? I know it is, and I'm like, now I have to click and everything on my own. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| no, I just want to say, your conversations about discipline, they're not new to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| You know, as a lifelong educator in the classroom, I know everybody thinks I've been a superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| working in the district office forever, but I know, John, your kids were at school at Austin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4466)|

| 1:14:38| and all of that shaped who I am today. All that shaped how I now as the CEO running from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| superintendent way I think about things. So it's very important to me, and so discipline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| something that I care a lot about. And just kind of looking through the story, some people may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| know this. So I was the principal at Fulton in 2006. You know, we had a lot of work to do when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| I got there. I was an assistant principal, moved into quickly in the first year and a half to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| head principal spot when our principal took a medical leave of absence. And what you see under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| the 2006 slide is what I inherited. So we had a 43.6% graduation rate, almost 1,100 suspensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| at that point, and we're facing state takeover. That's where we were. The state had given us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| few choices on what we could do. The district made the choice to go through a reconstitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| at that point. That was one of the two choices that were, I think, three choices that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| So through 2006 to 2011, we did a lot of work. We did a lot of work as a staff. I can still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| remember even as an assistant principal there. We were able to set up these kind of vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| committees, and everybody was on one. What are we going to do to try to solve this thing? How are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| we going to do better for kids and look through those processes? So one thing that we went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| is we went to small learning communities. We tried to make big small. This probably sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| familiar. I told you everything we do is informed by my past and looking at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| And it's not just, you know, a guess or a trial or a pilot. Like, I know this works, okay? Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| I've done it. I've walked it. I've lived it. And so we went through that, raised expectations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| kids. We also went through having teaming, kind of what you're seeing now in the 865 academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| and we're going to talk about in the whole child supports now. We went to that. We had teams of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| teachers teaching kids. We didn't teach subjects. We taught kids, right? We went around and looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| at the data. We had small SLC meetings where they talked about the best strategy, who had the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| relationship, where do we need to challenge kids more. Over that span of time in those five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| we actually worked with Stanford University. They didn't bring us any strategies. That's not what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| they were doing. Their job was to come on the ground and kind of do a case study of what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| were doing as we started seeing movement. I still remember every time they would come in, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| do a focus group with different kids. We didn't know who it was going to be. They'd ask us before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| they flew in. In one year, they said, we're going to talk to your junior AP English class. I had one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| of them. I'm like, okay, so we'll do it. So the kids went in there, you know, and we're expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| all this different kind of information. What they came out with, and they debriefed us afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| were we can do more. We've not been held to high expectations. Our teachers could actually ask us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| to do more, which was great for us. These are AP kids, right, in our school. So what I realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| through that whole process, kind of end of the stories, fast forward to 2011, our grad rate was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| almost 82% higher than the state average. But notice that bottom number. Our suspension rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| over 50% improvement on our suspension rate, right? What we saw was more kids graduating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| more kids engaged, and the lesson for me in those five years were things like behavior do increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| when kids are engaged and kids are being successful. That's extremely important for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| that. They're bought in. They have hope. I can remember as an AP at Fulton sitting and talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| to a student who was a freshman that I called in the hallway and brought into my office, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| what are you doing? And he pulled up his grades, had all the conversation with him, and he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| zero credits in the second semester. And he said, well, my goal is to get my... I said, what's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| goal? He said, I want to get my GED. That's what my cousin did. And I said, that's not a future for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| you. And so we, you know, worked with the guy, got him in with some other teachers. I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| calling Tim Irwin and saying, I'm not giving GEDs anymore. And he's like, what are you doing? He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| like, you can't do that. And I'm like, I have to. I have to shut the door for anything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| distracting these kids, but for the future that we're trying to build for him. He was supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| after a little while, but we got to that. So again, we saw the increase in achievement. We saw the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| increase in engagement. And we also saw behaviors get better, right? That's our goal for every kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| We saw it happen. So you go, okay, I'm an old guy now. That's 15 years ago. And I'm looking and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| saying, but I'm still encouraged because I see the same thing now. We were at Central High School a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| couple weeks ago and we took the 865 CEO Champions. We had all the CEOs go there to hear their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| And I was amazed. I didn't know these numbers, but when I heard Colin, their principal, stand up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| year two of what they're doing, here's what he tells me. They're seeing a 24% decrease in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| discipline referrals in their freshman academy. I go, why? They're all together. They have a common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| expectation. They all put their cell phones away. Everybody has the same thing. Hall passes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| lanyards that match if you're a freshman. There's nowhere to get away except for the high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| expectations teachers keep putting. There are teams of teachers meet every other week to talk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| every kid on their list for whatever reason that is. If their grades start dropping, they talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| about it. And there's always a story behind the kids. And those team of teachers who are in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| hallway together talk through that. And then they make interventions for those students. It may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| they need to see the counselor. It may be that they need some more study time. Maybe we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| call home to those parents and connect with them, but they own and know their kids. And that's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| making a difference. So 24% decrease in discipline referrals. Their attendance is up 2.5% among their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| freshmen. Their failure rate in Algebra 1 is down 25% in the first two years of their freshman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| academy. And it's not just happening at Central. When we go see other schools, South Bowl, Dr. Carr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| is reporting the same information, same kind of trends he's seen in his freshman academy. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| you have freshmen who are successful, guess what? You have sophomores who are successful. And now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| they can see the end and they move toward that and you stretch them. When I was at Fulton, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| introduced dual enrollment classes. That was kind of new. But I said, well, your kids don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| ACT to make it. I said, give me some. Talked to Anthony Wise. We started Pellissippi. We started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| courses there. Courses, the first one is just to get their feet wet. Hold them to higher expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| Next thing you know, these sophomores and juniors are saying, I can do college, right? Like that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| what we're doing. That's what we're trying to do across the board in every school. So I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| say I've lived it and there is a connection to that, for sure, that we need to make sure we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| doing what we do to get our kids academically engaged, holding to the high expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| behaviorally and academic. I don't hide from either one of those. And I expect every principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| who works for us to do the same thing. So some of these concepts of what we learned and what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| believe in from Fulton, every student's capable of success. I believe that in my heart. Every student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| we have, despite the background they're from, despite the times they've fallen behind, despite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| the times they've gotten off track, we have a way to get them there. I believe that happens by setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| and maintaining high expectations. And I believe that's how we prove we love kids. I remember when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| we were in the middle of this Fulton experience, we used to have people like Leadership Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| come and they would talk. And I sat with our then superintendent and I would tell the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| And I said, we love them so much we got to kick their butts every day. And he said, man, I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| you wouldn't say that. And I said, but it's true. Because if we don't, no one cares at the end. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| one cares. I always said it. No one cares if your diploma says Fulton or Farragut. In the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| UT is looking for the same kids. They're looking for the kids who can perform and get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| And I think when we set a low bar, we don't love our kids well. When we think they can't, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| the message we send them. When we say you can, you can behave like this. These are the actions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| will get you further. You can achieve in these classrooms. Because these are the things we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| will make you successful. And when we say they can't and we make excuses, that's not the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| to love them well. I believe that very much in my heart. And I also think this. When students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| achieve hard things, they buy in. Think about your own sake. When you set a goal and you hit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| like there's a level of confidence that comes with that. Kind of a local one because Mark's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| Madness is getting ready to start. I was reading through Dalton Connect's story. If you're a UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4924)|

| 1:22:21| And then he grew to be 6'6. He's at Northern Colorado. His goal, his dad says, from when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| was 10 was to play in the NBA. He's like, that's probably not going to happen at 6'3, right? But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| he kept working at it. Grew to 6'6. You know, was a pretty good player. And then had anywhere he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| wanted to go with the new transfer policy. He says he knew his weakness was that he was not a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| enough defender to play in the NBA. And he only wanted to talk to coaches that had a defensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4960)|

| 1:22:49| NBA. Came to Coach Barnes because of his reputation. Because he says, I wanted to be coached hard to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| ready, right? That's extremely important. And now he's going to be a national player of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| Probably first round of the draft is what people are saying. So I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| And I still will say this, last sentence on here. When students are bought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| engagement increases, behavior improves, and learning accelerates. I really believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| So I want to get into a little bit of our philosophy. How does this work? What does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| play out in every classroom? My expectation is playing out in every school this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| The first is we have to set and maintain high expectations, okay? Like this is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| A lot of parents in the room, you've gone through this process with your kids too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| We have to have those high expectations. Not because we're being mean, but because we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| what it takes to be successful at the next level. That is part of our job. To teach them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| academically, but also teach them right for wrong and how to do that. That doesn't just have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| that doesn't just happen. Kids come from all different backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| We have to do that through practice and for reinforcing those behaviors over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| And in my schools, when we go there, I was at Austin East for half a day on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| I saw that happening. When I go visit schools, I was at ball camp last week, I see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| We can't just assume everybody knows the right thing. So we have to show them that. We have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| practice that. We have to get in the line. We have to hand out papers. Those are expectations of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| we want it done. Not because we're trying to lord over anybody, but we're going to say these are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| efficient ways that are going to make you successful in the next thing. Once we've established those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| and once kids have learned that, we have to hold them to those expectations. They have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| accountable for those things that happen. And I believe this one is not always popular, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| issue consequences when they're needed. That's part of the learning process. You know, I drove a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| little fast in college till I got my first ticket. That is part of the process. And once I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| consequence with that, it changed my behavior, right? We're always trying to align behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:35| to what will make people successful on the other end. Now we need to make sure those are fair. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| have a whole system in place at Knox County Schools for that. Brian Hartzel and the work that he does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| there to lead that. We send, as Corey said, and she's going to go into more detail in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5084)|

| 1:24:52| If there's an error, if there's something that's off in the school, we spend time talking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| with them as well. So it's a consequence is not meant to be mean. A consequence is sometimes how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| we learn too. But I think the more important is the fourth bullet on here. We don't stop believing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| in any student. We do believe in meaningfully restoring every student back. Not if it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| one time, two times, three times. We believe in grace. I'll say that. I believe in that as a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| And I think none of us are perfect, and we have to learn those, right? So we restore you back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| because in the end, all 60,000 of these kids we believe are going to make it and need to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| That's very important for me that we don't skip any of those. Like these aren't any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| there's no part of this process we can skip, and students are not widgets, right? Some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| learn just if you practice on the first time. Some are going to have a consequence. Some are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| have two consequences. Some are going to be moved by the fact that they're accepted back in after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| they have a consequence, right? We don't know when they're going to learn that, but all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| are important for that to happen. Corey's talked about this. I think our most effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| strategy we have right now is that whole child is adults coming around students, looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| story, looking at what worked, looking at what didn't work, looking at what's going on in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| student's life and making decisions. So all of those pieces fit into our philosophy around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| discipline. And I just want to end with this, just to show my ongoing support of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| In 2019, School Culture Department was created. That was created in my division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| in Curriculum and Instruction. I'm so happy that I got to be the first person to hire who I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| is a rock star, not just here in the district in the work that she does and has led and has grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| the department, but Janice Cook was the first director of School Culture. That was a department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| that we created intentionally to address any barriers to learning that happen with students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| to really look at situations, look at how we could overcome those things. And I can't imagine our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| district without it now. I can't imagine without Janice's continued support and focus on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| I see things like de-escalation taught in classrooms. I see things like PBIS being put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| in the classrooms. I see things like restorative practices being experienced at Solos at Austin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| East when I was there on Friday as we practiced those things. This is really complex. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| not easy work. And again, kids are not widgets. So it's important for us, the ultimate goal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| academic outcomes because that's their future. And within that, we have to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| teaching right behaviors and addressing those and not skipping any of those parts. And I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| to say again before I hand this back to Corey, that I really appreciate Janice's heart and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| direction. She walks that line so well. I know a lot of you have experience with her. She is a lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| who believes in all three of those stages for students to be successful, has a heart for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| like we all do in that process, and really does a great job between those. So I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| that. I wanted to go on record of just kind of explaining discipline philosophy and how we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| it ties into our academics. And I'll turn back over to Corey to finish up. All right. And so as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:55| think about how that philosophy and how our school culture team, how our whole child support teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| really are leveraging, once again, the data at our disposal. So there is a very rich set of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| that we are positioning very specifically with our whole child support teams and with the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| that they are working with to ensure that every child has every opportunity to access the learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:19| environment for the maximum extent of time possible. And so I'm going to talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| about how we do that. But before I switch to the next slide, I do want to go back to that annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| action plan and what the crosswalk from our annual action plan is to this work. So for the past two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| years, we have had an objective centered on whole child support teams in the annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| Last year, our goal was to establish a whole child support team at every single school. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| entirely sure that Janice and her team thought they could do it, but they did. So they worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| hard. They worked with every single school to make sure that they had this system, they had this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| structure in place to identify, mitigate, and address barriers or obstacles to learning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:07| make sure that if students did experience a consequence, they were meaningfully restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| to the learning environment. This year, they went a step further. And so this year, the area of focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| they've really drilled down deep on is establishing a process to leverage those whole child support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| teams specifically to use the data at their disposal to identify trends and deploy school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| specific supports. And so that looks like that data package comes in the form of a monthly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| So on a monthly basis, our REA team is sending out a very rich data package. It is many, many pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| long to every single school. So every school principal receives this package of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| Their regional directors and supervisors receive the same package of information. And our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| culture department also receives that packet. I would love to put that in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| That would get very, very close to student identifiable information. And so while I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| show you the reports themselves, what I can do is tell you what's in those reports. So in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| monthly reports, you see a breakdown of incidents of behavior, behavior incidents in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| broken down by frequency within given locations in the school. Are we seeing a lot of trouble in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| a specific hallway in the school? If so, have we concentrated supervision in that hallway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| We're looking at time of day and week. Are Friday mornings rough? Probably. And so what are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| we doing? How are we adjusting our day in the classroom to accommodate for that if that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| trend that we're seeing? We're looking at student demographics. We're looking at problem behavior. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| the team is doing that with the intent of identifying those trends so they can deploy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| proactive supports and interventions so that we can intercede before behavior becomes a discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| That's the goal, right? So those monthly discipline reports are being used by those whole child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| support teams, again, to identify trends, to deploy supports and interventions, and most specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| to mitigate those barriers or obstacles to learning and maximize students' access to the learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| environment. What I will say, again, unfortunately I can't show you those reports. They would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| blank and so they wouldn't be super meaningful. But at our last board meeting, there was a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| made for a package of data that has been distributed in the past. And so we did run that report between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| last month and this month. This isn't super actionable data for us at the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| simply because we have more nimble data at our disposal. We are able to look at those trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| and dig into what we're seeing at a student level, at a school level. But if we take a step back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| we look at what's happening at a district level, board members, you have a full packet of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| in front of you. And for the community that's listening and following, we will make that packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| of data available. We'll be attaching that to the board agenda this afternoon so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:10| all of the data that's contained within that package is available. It is multiple pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| But this is a snapshot of overall out-of-school suspensions throughout the district broken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| by student subgroup. And so this is a risk ratio. These aren't percentages. And so just to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:26| recalibrate around what a risk ratio is, what it is we're really looking at on this screen, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| looking really for the numbers that are getting you close to one. So the closer a number, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| see kind of at the tail end of all of those bar graphs, the numbers that are getting the closest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| to one are illustrating incidents of out-of-school suspension that are getting pretty close to parity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| that are on par with the proportion of students in a given subgroup compared to their overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| percentage within the entire student population. So another way of saying that is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| numbers that are less than one illustrate incidents of out-of-school suspension that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| are proportionately less in a given subgroup compared to the overall student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| The flip side of that is that numbers that exceed one are proportionately greater. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| illustrating a proportionately greater percent of out-of-school suspensions within a given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| student subgroup compared to that student subgroup in the overall student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| That is the risk ratio. And again, this is probably the best way we can illustrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| what's happening in the discipline space at the district level. We do prefer to dig into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| very specific incidents because what we can't do in looking at this graph is say, you know, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| going on here. We'd be taking some wild guesses. And so I'm hesitant to do that. But what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| when we drill down a little bit deeper and we look at the school level is deploy very school-specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| supports to make sure that, again, we are intervening ideally proactively and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| we're restoring responsibly when incidents of out-of-school suspension or other consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| are given. I would also be remiss if we didn't briefly refocus around kind of these major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| academic milestones that you've heard us talk about before that are really kind of our major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| indicators of success in the academic space. And so you hear us talk all the time about third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| ELA proficiency, about eighth grade math proficiency, about our ready graduate rate throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| district. And so because we were already looking at student subgroup, I also wanted to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| quick look at these major milestones by student subgroup as well. As you can see, our third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| ELA proficiency overall in the district, 43.5 percent. It's a number that we're proud of. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| jumped almost five percentage points. It's unheard of throughout the district. We're still below 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| percent, right? And if you look at those individual student subgroups, we start to fall even lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| than that. And this becomes incredibly important when you think back to Dr. Ricewick and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| philosophy that he laid out. If we think about those high expectations and achievement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| classroom, engagement in the classroom as being that driving force and everything else following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| engagement in the classroom, behavior incidents falling as I become more engaged, as I begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| see a future for myself in and beyond the classroom, this is incredibly important. So you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| that again in eighth grade math, we're at 21.6 percent proficiency at the district level and even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| lower than that in a lot of student subgroup areas. Ready graduate rate, you see numbers that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| pretty reflective of our third grade ELA proficiency rate. And so what does all of this mean? At the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| of the day, it just means we have work to do. We have a lot of work to do at the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| And we know that across those last few slides we've illustrated that we have work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| And we believe that we're going to give students the best possible chance for success. And we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| going to continue to do this work in a deep and meaningful way by connecting the dots, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| connecting our students and our staff members with the most relevant, most actionable data points to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| them to be able to make real-time decisions to meet their established goals at the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| at the school level, and at the student level. So with that in mind, are there any questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| how we use data at the district level or throughout the district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:19| That was great. Thank you, Corey. Reverend Butler. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Corey and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| Superintendent Razek for the presentation and for all the work that is being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:34| in this area. And that is one of the reasons why I really, let me say, I just really love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:44| this presentation because it does do a good job of letting us know what we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| and letting our shareholders, which I call those, since we're the board, we must have shareholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:57| And those, that's the community because community members pay into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5817)|
| 1:37:04| public schools. So they need to understand what they're getting. And this was an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| presentation, Dr. Razek. I really could relate to your slides, especially the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:18| because my family and I came to Knoxville in 2007, and we had a foster child that went to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:27| she was in her senior year at Austin East, and my son was an eighth grader at Vine. We chose those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:37| schools to go to because they were in the community in which I served as a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| And I always said that I will serve and try to live in the community that I live in or live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:51| the community I serve in and support that community. And so my most valuable commodities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| was going to those schools, and so I really wanted to see them turn around. And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| Austin East did the same. They came off the list and their graduation rate grew greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| And I know Project Grad had a hand in that, and they, that was one of the reasons why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| really enjoyed Austin East was because of what they offered us through Project Grad as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| all of the other things. Benny Perry was our principal, and I think he, you and he collaborated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| and talked about a lot, and that both of them came the same way. Unfortunately, we're back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| we're back there again. And so we have to do something, and we're doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:40| I really want to say and instead of but. I've learned that whatever you say before the but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:48| is contradicted after the but. But a and means that you're adding to it. And I really believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| that you had the district-level data, the school-level data, the student-level data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5936)|
| 1:39:04| and I think you need to have a community-level data. I think the community has a right and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| have a responsibility to communicate how we're doing. I do believe you showed us tonight, Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| Razzie, that there is a correlation between behavior and student success. I think the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| that we saw at the end shows that as well. And I think that there is a disparity in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| outcome in Knox County schools. Somebody wrote an OCR complaint about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:42| and it's in the same range it was then. That was 2014. So 10 years later, we're still in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:52| place. And I know for a fact all the work that Knox County schools have done to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| but it still hasn't made a difference. And I think we have to keep the numbers in our face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| to know we still have work to do. And I think once again the community has a right to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| this data. It doesn't mean that we're not doing our job. It just means that we still have a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| to do. I also wanted to lift up the whole child support teams. And I will admit I'm a little biased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:35| because I learned and continue to keep abreast of what is going on in that area simply because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:42| my daughter works in that area. And I'm working on a PhD in that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| And so I really think that that is a major contributor to us resolving these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| I understand the data that we receive, and I want the community to understand the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| to receive does not tell the whole story. We still see the disparity. And I'm not going to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:09| on my soapbox or climb into the pulpit tonight, but I will say that that disparity we see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| consistent with what we see in our community as a whole. And what we see in terms of socioeconomic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| standards, the rate of pay, where we live, and all of that. So our schools are pretty much a mirror| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| of our community, our society. So I just want us to make sure that we're not going to beat up more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:37| Knox County schools because of the data, but we do need to receive the data. And that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| things that I think that I hear a lot of people saying, and I know that was one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| that we were saying at the time when I was just on the outside as an advocate, but still feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| part of the solution. And I think that we definitely have to continue to do the things we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| doing because there have been some improvements in our feeder schools in District 1. We saw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:12| third grade level promotion data and other things. But once again, thank you for the work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| being done. I think we're on the right track, we're in the right path, but we have to keep on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| looking at the scoreboard so we know that how we're doing. And I think we can't be afraid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| sharing the data because hopefully, five years from now, we'll see data similar at Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| where we saw at Fulton or any other school that is being challenged right now to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you, Reverend Butler. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I don't mean this sarcastically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:55| that was worth the price of admission. I would have come to the meeting just for that. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| kidding. I think it was one of the better presentations that I've heard in four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| between the two of you because it really gets at the heart of what we do and why we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| and also understanding how we make decisions about what we do and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| Corey, that was one of the best presentations on data I've ever heard and I've sat in a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| I'm serious. The only thing that I would add to it, if I dare try to, is that you spoke a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:27| how those indicators of success and a lot of the work that we're doing kind of push towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| student outcomes. The other thing that I've learned, though, as I've had to analyze data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| is that outcomes also inform backward and they also need to inform what you do. Because at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| end of the day, when you're confronted with a list of outcomes, you have a choice to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| You can first say, are we measuring the wrong thing? Right? That's a choice you get to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| You also get to make the choice of, maybe we're measuring the right thing, but we're not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| the right result, and then you have to make the choice, well, why? Why am I not getting the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| result? Is it because we're doing the wrong thing? That might be one thing that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| I don't think that's probably the case with what we've just heard. It's also to the quality in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| which we're doing it and the output in which we're doing it. How much of it are we doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| right? You can do the right thing but not do enough of it, or you can do it with poor fidelity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| correct? And that's why outcomes go, you need to look from the outcome backward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| right? And that's the only way you can make shifts, especially when you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| larger systems like this. And Dr. Roswick, if I dare say this, we're cut a little bit from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| same cloth. We, the reason why Restoration House has been able to work with low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6276)|

| 1:44:47| and 100% of our moms who go back to school go back to school getting bachelor's and master's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6287)|

| 1:44:55| you know, the people you'd be typecast as. They're the ones that are living off the system and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| all that. Or moms who are buying first homes coming out of Restoration House. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| previously formerly homeless. It's for the two reasons you just said. High expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:11| them absolutely believing I'm not a statistic, right? That I can do this thing. And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:18| we mentioned a lot about whole child support here. I would say we do whole family support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| We work around the whole family, top-down, two-generational. And, you know, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| things we do a lot of is therapeutic supports. And it's hard to kind of speak to the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| of that, but it impacts everything else, right? And the only reason I'm saying this is not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| make a case for Restoration House, although if you want to check it out, it's because what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| describing is not true just in education, right? It's true in so many facets of our community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| the way in which we work. I mean, one of the things that I heard that I've never forgot 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| years ago was the Pygmalion effect, which is exactly what you described, right? You hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| people to high expectations. And so, I really appreciate your impassioned comments around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6355)|

| 1:46:13| I've done it, right? And I appreciate that. And I would hope that anybody who's listening to tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| would, their confidence would increase. And not just you, but the team that is also supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| that philosophy and that work. Reverend Butler, the comments that you made to me were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:35| I was trying to think, how do I get to the real crux of the issue that I keep hearing brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| Because we talked around a lot about the issue in the presentation, and I don't fault the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| presentation. I mean, the presentation was great. But what you said about also community-level data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| to me, that's the question that has yet to be answered. Is what data is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| for the community to have access to, and for the right reasons? One of the things that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| mentioned was the annual report several times. And 11A on that annual report talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| whole child supports. To me, an indicator of success is discipline data related to whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:16| child supports, right? You would have some indication of if that's successful if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| seeing a decrease in discipline. But to me, the discipline data is not what the overarching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| concern of the community has been for the last 10 or 15 years. It's not discipline data by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| It is exactly what Reverend Butler said. It is the persistent, pervasive disparities around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| discipline and academic data. And let me say this. That's not just true in Knoxville. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| you study any major city in our country, you're going to see very similar disparities in data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:52| And those are for historical reasons. There is a history that has got us to where we are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| right, with that. And nobody believes it's going to be a quick fix. Nobody believes that it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| to be something that one administration is going to do. But I think all I've heard in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| four years since I've been on the board from several segments of our community is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| we want to keep understanding that data so we can understand if that needle is moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| that very particular needle, which all the other things you all addressed tonight is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| right? And we need to be investing deeply at a student level and at a school level and at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| district level. But there are people in our community who are concerned, and I think rightfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| so, about those disparities that you're never going to understand the impact and whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| they're changing, actually, if you just look at some of the other lower levels of data. I get why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| discipline data is by far most useful at a school level. Totally understand that. But that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| going to help you understand if as a system we are, the effects of everything that we do, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| not one thing. Nobody's going to come up with one implementation, one strategy, one program that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| says, nope, that's going to completely eliminate our disparities, right? It's the whole of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| we do. And that's the argument that you're making. It's the whole of what we do. But an indicator to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| understand whether or not the whole of what we do is affecting that. I think I said this in a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| a couple years ago. I will tell you, if Knox County Schools is able to address that metric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| the historical disparity metric related to academics and discipline and R, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| I will promise you there's going to be communities all across this country who come to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:36| help us figure that one out, right? Because that's been the challenge. And then, Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| man, I'm giving lots of props tonight. The other word that you mentioned is fear. And I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| the bottom line. I think the reason why some people don't want to talk about that data is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| there's a fear of the perception of that data and what it says about us as a community and our past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| and all those types of things. And to me, it's like most of us, all of us in this room, were not a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:09| of the direct violation of people's rights and oppression that got us to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:16| But we are where we are today. And we are asked to steward where we are today, right? So nobody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:24| trying to, like, point the finger and blame anybody at this room or anybody in this district about why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| we are where we are. But we are where we are. And so there's a need to address that explicitly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:36| And I think that's what I'm hearing in the community. Dr. Eiswick, I believe 100% in my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| that you care about that issue. And I also believe that you feel like the philosophy that you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:48| unpacked for us tonight will address that. I completely believe that you believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| I actually have a lot of confidence in that, too. I think that the district, I mean, the people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| the community are just saying, will you show us the data to help us understand that one particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| thing, whether or not we're, the disparities that we see in academic and disciplined data are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| actually changing. I think that's all they're asking. And I think, I do think a major factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| not from any one individual in this group, but culturally, the reason why we're not more willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| to share that when we're willing to share a lot of other data is because of the fear and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| perception and the belief of, I don't want to own that story. I could be wrong. But I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:34| end where I started. Props. Seriously. Best presentation in four years. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:44| Ms. Christie. Yeah, just to reiterate on that, that was an amazing presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:53| I do love the comment that, you know, without context, it's just a dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6713)|
| 1:52:04| And also, just to speak to a little bit of what you had said, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| I kind of pushed back on sharing this last month. And now that I see it, I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| I think, it wasn't fear. It's just what I hear around discipline is probably very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:22| from what you hear from my community. I mean, I do hear from a lot of parents and staff that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:29| would argue that there's not enough discipline in schools. And, and when you share this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| and when you share this, and the conversation in the public becomes a big debate on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:44| there's too much or not enough, right? We kind of lose focus of all this great stuff that can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:52| Right? The why behind it. It does become just about discipline when you bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6772)|
| 1:53:01| groups with very different viewpoints of it. So I do think we have to be careful about that. And I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| I think we do offer a lot of supports and alternative pathways. I noticed, shout out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:17| Dr. Wilson and Dr. Faulkner at Paul Kelly, where I forget how many of their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:25| um, 13 students earned a national industry certification from TCAT in machining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:33| this month. And that's 13 kids that weren't even on a path to graduate last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| So, so I do think that it's important that, you know, like I said, it's not necessarily fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| It's more of it being a dot without having the whole story behind it, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| where I'm coming from and what I hear from people in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6832)|
| 1:54:01| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| Madam Chair, thank you, Ms. Christie. I just want to echo what you said. I agree. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:10| there's lots of data that we can show in isolation that would tell not the right story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| Um, and I think that's one of the problems KCS has had and, and, um, over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| and not necessarily with this administration, but, um, acquiescing to request for data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| without having the context to tell the whole story. And to me, Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| may I come back at you? It's the and thing. To me, it's both, right? Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:42| to also remove that data tells a story, right? And that's the story that I think some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| are hearing and asking why. What's, what is the reason if, if it's not in isolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| but we're asking for it in context, why not do that? Um, and to me, that, to me, it's like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| both and. Like, you need the whole story. I mean, I remember the first two years that I was on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| board. I mean, and I was working with the Disparities in Educational Outcomes Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and every meeting I was in with Bob, it was like, got to focus on academics, got, we've been focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| on discipline too much, got to focus on academics. And I wasn't there for that journey leading up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| that, but I was like, yeah, you're right. So, I mean, and, and I think there was an acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:25| of that, but it's not a, and only talk about one and don't talk about the other. And I think that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| I think that's part of the challenge that some people are having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:37| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Um, just thinking about data that is personally identifiable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:47| I'd like to remind our board that while that can't be shared in a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| we can certainly see that and we can certainly reach out and ask for explanations of how that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| being used very specifically. So, I think it would behoove us to do that and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| we understand exactly how it's being used in any place that we have a concern. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6965)|
| 1:56:14| Thank you. Any other questions, discussions? I have to say that was, I agree with Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| that was the best presentation I've seen in my four years on the board. Thank you for sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| that with us tonight. Would y'all be okay if we take a break? A good 10-minute break? Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:34| Moving on, we are still on our work session agenda. Moving on, we will now move to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| Strategic Plan Committee update. Ms. Christie, do you have an update for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:47| I have to say I am enjoying that committee. Yeah, me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| Well, this will be a much shorter and lighter presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| Just saying, hopefully a more pleasant one for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| So, just to give an update, we did have two meetings. We were a little bit behind what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:09| originally had planned because of the weather in January, but we did manage to squeeze into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| in February, and the committee itself approved a timeline and framework to present to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:24| We do have a couple of proposals that we would like to ask the board to consider. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7044)|
| 1:57:32| had a discussion about that, and of course anything that we do ask would have to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| come back later to the board as a contract, but we would like to get the board's blessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| or at least their thoughts on some discussions we had around outside vendors before we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:51| with that. And the fabulous Ms. Lautner, who's really good at these presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:58| actually put together some notes from our meeting, and I'm just going to kind of kick it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| Cori, if that's okay. It's like the Ms. Lautner show tonight. I know, right? You're doing such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| great job. Y'all are going to get really tired of me. So, I will make this quick because some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| this you all have seen before. So, these first few slides are a rehash of a previous presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| I had done, just kind of walking us through what strategic plans for Knox County Schools had looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| like in the past as some initial context leading into our strategic planning work for this upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| cycle. And so, the real takeaway from this slide is that strategic planning has been done a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| of different ways over the course of the last, you know, 15 or so years, and it has produced a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:45| number of different types of plans over the last 15 or so years. And so, we have, as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:53| leveraged everything from staff to board to some external support to develop our strategic plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| that we have published for the district. The establishment of those strategic plans has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| consisted of everything from major goal establishment to establishing some very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| granular performance objectives to revising and reframing mission and vision statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:18| The breadth of those documents has spanned from 12 pages in our current iteration to 103 pages if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| you go back to 2009. And so, there's a lot of flexibility in what a strategic plan can consist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:30| of. And so, we have a lot of opportunity to decide what it is we want this next iteration to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| and contain for Knox County Schools. As a reminder, the last time we discussed strategic planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:45| we laid out a very high-level roadmap. So, we're actually going to take this roadmap a step further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| in just a moment. So, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on this slide. What I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| is that the board did choose to form a strategic planning committee. You heard Ms. Christy say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| we've met twice. Ms. Christy is our chair. We are also joined by Ms. Henderson, Reverend Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| Steve Rutter, our director of REA, and myself. And so, we've had a lot of fun together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| And over the past few meetings, we've had an opportunity to put a lot of dots on a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| And this is the timeline that we are proposing to the board as the strategic planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| What you see on the screen outlines proposed committee work and proposed board action. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| can see there's a lot of back and forth that we're proposing here. And that's intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| That's the committee really wanting to do this work in coordination with the larger board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| make sure that we're checking in every step of the way. And that first check-in is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| taking place this week in the form of a proposed vote on Thursday. So, the strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| framework and the timeline that we are proposing began in February with us just looking over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| you know, what is our timeline? What's our proposed framework for engagement going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| We've moved forward into March. And what we've determined is that we would like to propose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| the full board the use of external contractors for two elements of this work. And we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| to talk about that in just a moment. But we're really talking about two separate potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| external contractors. One to help us with stakeholder engagement and to begin a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:30| quickly than the other. The other to really focus on strategic planning. And we're making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| request for a couple of different reasons. One, because we do think that there are two very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| different skill sets between stakeholder engagement and doing that in a deep and meaningful fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| compared to strategic planning and doing that in a deep and meaningful fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| And also because time is of the essence here. And so, we can move a lot more quickly on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| contracts than we can move on one large contract that would have to go through the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7313)|
| 2:02:00| So, if the board were to give its approval for the use of two independent external contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| our timeline would look something like this. We would ask for that vote on Thursday. Following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| the results of that vote, we would begin the process of identifying a vendor specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| for stakeholder engagement later this month. We would then transition in April into bringing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:25| contract to the board to consider and hopefully approve for stakeholder engagement. Following that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| we would ideally begin stakeholder engagement. We'll talk a little bit in just a minute about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| what all that will consist of. We'd run stakeholder engagement from April through May. And we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| also simultaneously be thinking about a strategic planning contract as well. So, we are anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| the need for that contract to go through the RFP process. And so, that is why you see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:53| potentially initiating a little bit later in this timeline. So, ideally, we'd be able to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| a contract to the board for consideration for strategic planning in June, which would allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| to then hopefully begin the real work of strategic planning in July and August. That work would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| consist of synthesizing findings from the stakeholder engagement process and also looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| our major initiatives at the district level, our existing initiative plans, our annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| engaging with the board, and doing a lot of synthesis around what we want to be true in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| five years in backward mapping, how we can benchmark ourselves to that goal. In the July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| workshop, we would also then ideally have a report out from our stakeholder engagement vendors. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| is where those two worlds start to collide. So, remember, we've got two separate vendors. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| kind of moving on two separate planes right now. And the board is engaging ideally with both of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| them. So, in July, you would hear that report on stakeholder engagement that would be ideally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| handed then to your strategic planners for that synthesis process. Moving into September, a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7436)|
| 2:04:03| of things potentially happen in September. With the board itself, ideally, you have the stakeholder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| sorry, the strategic planning vendor engaging with the board. The committee has proposed at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| board annual workshop around some organizational visioning. So, that's that opportunity to then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| take the proposal from the strategic planners and identify, you know, what's an appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:25| mission and vision that really captures and frames the heart of that work and the spirit behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| In September, we would also ideally, and I think this is a really important step, and it's one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| is often missed in the strategic planning process. We talked a lot about it at the committee level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| I think the entire committee felt very strongly about doing this. We would also take that initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| proposal from the strategic planners back for another round of stakeholder engagement. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| that would be kind of our validation process. Is the plan that we are proposing, does it resemble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7493)|
| 2:05:00| what we heard from the community? Does the community recognize and see their input in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| proposed plan? Is the language that we're using accessible? Does it resonate with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| or do we need to try to do some redrafting, some reframing, and go back to the drawing board? So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| depending on how well that validation process goes, we would be doing potentially some synthesis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:24| and some finalization through the month of October with those strategic planners in the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| committee to prepare to bring an initial plan to the full board for consideration and for a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| in November. We've also built in some time for some potential revisioning and reframing again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| following that conversation just to give us a little bit of padding and a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| opportunity to do one last pass at finalizing that five-year strategic plan with the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:52| bringing it ideally for a final vote if necessary in December, which would allow us to begin our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| new five-year plan in January of 2025, which seems wild. So, what you all will be asked to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:13| what the board will be asked to consider on Thursday, again, is the use. So, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| contracts yet, and this is kind of an odd request, and we talked a lot with Mr. Dupler about how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:25| potentially navigate this. We are asking that the board consider approving the use of two external| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7585)|
| 2:06:32| contractors for this work, and that is because if the board does not have an appetite for that, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:37| the board would like for us to proceed in a different direction, we just need that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| sooner rather than later so we can go back to committee and we can do some revisioning early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7601)|
| 2:06:47| and some planning around how we want to revise that strategic planning framework to either do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| the work internally or do the work as a board committee. So, if the board were to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7612)|
| 2:07:00| the use of two external vendors, we're really looking at two separate procurement processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| based on what we anticipate the potential cost for these two contracts to be. We imagine that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| cost for stakeholder engagement would be a little bit less than the cost for strategic planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| so we're anticipating stakeholder engagement falling somewhere in the range of $25,000 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:20| $50,000. That would put us in informal bid territory, so really all we would need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:27| is requisition three quotes, and I can turn it over to Ms. Christie here in just a moment. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| going to talk through a little bit more of what the committee was anticipating in terms of how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| go about that process and vetting those prospective contracts and vendors. For the strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:44| contract, we are anticipating that might crest the $50,000 threshold. If it does, we will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| to have gone through RFP, so we would like to go ahead and just put that proposal out on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| street to be on the safe side, and so that would be a contract proposal that we would need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7675)|
| 2:08:01| ahead and send to procurement sooner rather than later to make sure that they are ready and able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:06| to move on that process. So, to kind of frame what we're talking about, and also I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:12| those colors were not as bright on my computer. I apologize. That's very bright. So, if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| ignore the color scheme, stakeholder engagement, again, we're looking at an informal bid for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| process. You can kind of see where the stakeholder engagement elements of the timeline. We've pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| those down into this box, so those are kind of your primary touches where stakeholder engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| specifically is concerned, and we would be looking for a facilitator who could facilitate and conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:40| multilingual, multimodal engagement with a large number of stakeholders and a very diverse number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:47| of stakeholders, and so when we say multimodal, we mean everything from surveys to focus groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| in English, Spanish, Kurundi, Swahili. You know, we have a lot of languages that are spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| throughout the district, and we want to be responsive to that and engage our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| in the language that is most comfortable for them. We have asked that we would ask that a stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| engagement vendor would then compile and report on the results of their findings to the full board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| and also provide that report to a strategic planning consultant along with all of their raw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:22| data as well. For strategic planning, again, we are anticipating needing to go through the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| process for this, and really what we would be asking of a strategic planning vendor would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| to analyze that feedback, to also look at our priorities as a district, to look at what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| board wants to be true, what is the board's five-year vision for success, look at all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| existing initiatives with everything from our Region 5 strategic plan to our 865 academies work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:52| to all of our other sort of mini initiatives that are currently in operation throughout the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| and make sure that there's a coherent line of forward momentum and we're not stutter-stepping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| with any of our existing work to accommodate for a five-year strategic plan. We are also asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| that vendor generate a comprehensive, easily digestible, this was very important to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:14| committee at large, that this be an easily digestible document, five-year framework to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| deliver on ambitious but ultimately achievable long-term goals, and we are asking that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:26| particular contract is the one that include that organizational visioning, so that's where the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| would kind of huddle up and go through the process of establishing potentially a new mission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| vision statement for the district. You can see the timeline that is relevant to strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| also laid out at the bottom of that box. Oh, and I am finished and turning it over to Ms. Chrissy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:51| All right, and Mr. Dupler, you might want to add something or Reverend Butler or Ms. Henderson if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| you want to add to it, but one of the biggest things was, you know, when talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| informal bid, those, once we get those quotes, that would still have to come back to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:10| but the thought behind that was we would like to gauge, you know, how the board feels about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| before we go out and solicit quotes or put out an RFP, because if you do that and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| you know, you come back in April and it gets voted down, then you, you know, wasted two months, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| certainly don't want to be in that position, and I don't know if Ms. Henderson, Dr. Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7888)|
| 2:11:36| is there anything we missed here? I don't think so. All right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7896)|
| 2:11:48| There was one last slide. Did you want to cover this one? Sorry, I sat down too soon. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:55| so the stakeholder engagement, that would be, that was the email we discussed people could send input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7915)|
| 2:12:03| to, right, and then for the strategic planning, if the board is agreeable, we would put out an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:12| for that, and we talked a little bit about, like the work Katamba did creating the Region 5 way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:22| and their work, I mean, that was, I mean, they're not a local organization, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| just in terms of what we're looking for. And I would say this slide probably should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:34| labeled a little differently, and that was on me. This was just, I think Reverend Butler, you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| have raised this point, wanting to ask the question that if the board does vote to approve the use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| external vendors, how could they get in contact with us, and so we did just want to have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| that we could attach to an agenda that would outline how they would express interest, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| that is what this slide is speaking to. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| title does a good job. I mean, I'm assuming you don't want, like, the public just to start emailing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| that address with your feedback at that point, so that's good. Thank you all for all the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| on this, and Ms. Christie, and thank you for the explanation, and just two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:19| One, I'm assuming the recommendation from the committee is to go look for external vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:25| and ideally, too, right? So, I mean, to me, I'm going to heed the recommendation of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| because I mean, you all have given way more thought to it than I have, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| And let me ask this question. I noticed in the history that you gave, there was a couple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| in the strategic planning process that a new mission and vision was articulated. There was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| one time when it was not. You also mentioned that we'll kind of get recommendations about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| strategic plan and then form a mission and vision out of that. To me, that's really backward. Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| any time I've ever heard about strategic planning or been involved in it, mission and vision kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| of sets the tone for everything else. I get that this is a public entity, and board members change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| and all the things, right? Is there a reason why we're not leading with our mission and vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:12| that's already articulated to say, filtering? To me, that would be important in RFP, like, for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| to understand what bones are you bringing to the table. And then I've got one more additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| question, but that probably needs to be answered first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| So, thank you. That's a good question, because we spent quite a few minutes talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:34| I always knew which came first, the chicken or the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| But in this case, we didn't know which ones were the chicken and which ones were the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:46| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| So, I think that's going to happen in September, and that's kind of at the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:56| strategic planning process of after they had synthesized the findings and have drafted the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8096)|
| 2:15:05| And we want to make sure that our mission, goals, and visions are consistent with what they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:13| so that discussion would happen at our annual workshop. And then, if there is any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| synthesizing or feedback to do, they still have time to do that. If we were to do that prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8120)|
| 2:15:27| hearing from the public, it would be like we made up our mind what we want to do before we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| from. And the timing of it, I think, was that September workshop was a good timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| That they've done enough work, but they haven't done too much that we would be disruptive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| Yeah, I appreciate that. So, here would be my recommendation, and I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8146)|
| 2:15:52| what I'm saying is not what you all are saying. I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| I think in order to even start the strategic planning process, you have to have a mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| and vision identified. You have to kind of start there. And we do have one. And so, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| encouragement would be, let's lead with that and say, hey, here's our current mission and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| And through the process, if we decide to modify, that's different than we're not articulating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:16| mission and vision. We're going to go through the strategic planning process, and then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| going to create a mission and vision. To me, that is the chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:26| So, I would encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Well, and we actually spoke a little bit about that, about how we have our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| And, you know, we have the reaching five-way. I mean, we have other, you know, guidelines there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:41| So, and we did discuss that, but we did not want to specifically lead with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| because we didn't want the community to feel like that, we didn't want to hear about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| There's already a box, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Right, we wanted them to feel free to share anything they wanted to, in that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| If I may, if you go to, I think, the next slide, or two slides after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| that one, you'll see it says, for under the strategic planning, analyze stockholder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:18| stakeholder feedback, priorities, board vision, outcomes, existing initiatives. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| they look at what we have. Sure. So, I was saying, I think, the same thing. They're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| to start with what we have, but some way in that process, we're going to say, let's just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| that we, after hearing everything, that we still have those same mission and goals and vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8253)|
| 2:17:43| I thought there was a chance we were saying the same thing. I just didn't want to make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| assumption. The last thing that I would encourage the board to consider through the strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:53| planning process, and also, it would need to be a part of the RFP, because it would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| intentional part of that scope of work, and I'm not trying to complicate things, but one thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:03| KCS, especially at its size, does not have articulated. You do a great job articulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:09| the priorities and people aligned around that. KCS, like any organization, if you're around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| long enough, you'll get a sense of what their core values are. Whether or not they've codified them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| or not, it doesn't matter if they ever put them on a brochure. If you spend enough time within an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| organization or with an individual, you'll get a sense of what their core values are. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| really smart for organizations to take the time to codify them, and here's the difference, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| here's the reason why core values are so important. Core values, when you filter your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| making through core values, it helps you decide the particular solution you're going to bring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:47| a problem. There's lots of solutions, potentially, to a given problem, but there's some things I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:52| not do because it does not align with my core values. Does that make sense, what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| And so it also affects the way we posture ourselves, and to me, when I looked at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:03| history of this organization, the last set of core values, I'm pretty sure this is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| Terry told me this, it was a board chair, this is probably, well, roughly eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| now I've undated it, if anybody wants to go look it up, who literally wrote their own set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| of core values and brought them to a board meeting and asked for them to be passed, and they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| They lived for a very short period of time in an old strategic planning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| That's not the way to do it, but I would encourage the board to consider that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| that's a topic just like the priorities are. Do you ever go to a meeting and not talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| about the priorities? Probably not, right? Which is a good thing, right? Because it's all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| alignment, right? Those core values, they need to be lived out in at least three areas. That is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:52| the way we reflect our relationship with our core constituency, which is students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| right? That's got to be reflected in that, students and parents. They also have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| reflected in the way we interact within our team, right? So teacher and teacher and within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| school and all that. They also have to be reflective of the way we interact with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| larger community. So to me, it's a really powerful alignment tool to say, here's how we said we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:15| going to act in these spaces. Here's how we're going to posture ourselves, and we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| filter our decision making through it. I'm not going to be here long term. If y'all don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| to do it, it's fine. But I think it's something to consider in the strategic planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| and that's why I haven't brought it up in the past, because we had a strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| but to me, now that we're thinking about this, this is the time to potentially decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| do we want to codify our core values? We have them, and if anybody's been in this organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| long enough, they get a sense of what they are. But I would challenge the board now to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| codify them, and that is an opportunity, not just for a brochure, I have no interest in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:50| but it's an opportunity to continue to create more alignment within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Ford? Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate the work that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| guys have done on the strategic plan thus far, and look forward to living through at least part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| of it. So I would be fine with the procurement process that you've laid out here, and I'm kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:15| of like Mr. Watson, if that's what the committee is comfortable with, I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| Thank you. Ms. Owen? Thank you, Madam Chair. Maybe Ms. Ford can help me remember. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:26| when we were working on the strategic plan last time, I don't think we intended to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| the mission and vision. I think that just sort of occurred as we were working, and that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:39| felt like it needed to be changed as we went. So I don't think we sat down initially and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:44| we're going to change it. Thank you. Is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:52| Okay. All right. Thank you, Ms. Lautner, Ms. Christy, for that presentation, and we will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:58| that item come back up in a little bit on our agenda. Next up, Dr. Adams, custodial update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8518)|
| 2:22:09| Madam Chair, members of the board, so currently we have 68 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:13| Four of those schools exceed 50 percent or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| Thank you. Mr. Triplett, legislative update. Is this? Oh, my goodness. I'm so sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:24| Reverend Butler. You have a question on custodial, right? I apologize. I was a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Vice Chair. I had gotten an email and a request to know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:42| the custodians had heard about the resolution for staff that speaks out and speaks up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:51| not being retaliated against, and I wanted Dr. Rizek, if you would, to speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| because I know I've seen more than one action that you have taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you, Reverend Butler. No, you, I think I told the board internally, what's today? Today's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:08| Monday. Last week, sorry, that we were sending out. I think Friday we sent that out to all staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| and in that, my apologies. I know it was passed last fall by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| and to tell you the truth, like, I looked at the references back to policy, but didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| think about sending that to that level, and then talking to Assemblyman Garner, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| about what level of training folks had in that, and I think there is a group, some of our classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:33| I think there is a group, some of our classified staff that may not receive that same level as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| some, so we thought clarify and send it out to all, so we did on Friday send that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:47| I apologize, Reverend Butler, for missing you. Sorry about that. I'm glad he caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| Mr. Triplett. Sure, on the legislative front, just a couple things. The lotteries for education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| basically the cakewalks, looks like that looks promising, and then everybody's obviously talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| about the vouchers and that kind of thing. There are a couple different bills. The Senate has one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| that also includes the governor's version, but the interesting thing that's really completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| different about the House bill is House Bill 1183, if you have interest in reading it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| but it includes a number of other changes to education in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| a number of which TSB actually supports, just some things related to teacher evaluations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| some options for insurance for teachers, and there's a whole list of things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| it does a lot more, I guess, than just vouchers and seem to be some things that a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| would support, so just as we follow those, if you have opinions on those, obviously you can share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| those with your representatives. Thank you, Mr. Triplett. Okay, moving on. We are now moving on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:59| into our regular session agenda. What time is it? It's almost eight. We're good. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:06| mention publicly that the MOU with the United Way for the Community Schools Program Management was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| still being finalized when our meeting agendas were published last week, so that has been added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| on to your electronic agenda, and that is item 7c6, and I don't know if Matt was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:29| I didn't know if you wanted to speak to that at all, Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| I just wanted to give you, you know, the floor in case you wanted to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| Yeah, thank you. So we have been with the United Way, Community Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:46| has been with the United Way since July of this, of 2023, and so we are really excited about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:53| the Evaluation Planning Committee that we served on with both the University of Tennessee and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8753)|
| 2:26:00| County Schools to sort of come up with a new logic model and a new plan going forward for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:07| and so we're really excited about the opportunity to enter into a five-year MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| with the district and continue to do the work that Community Schools has been doing since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:21| Does anybody have any? Okay, awesome. Thank you, Adam. No problem. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| Okay, moving on into our agenda, 7a or b,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:35| c1 or 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:42| 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8802)|
| 2:26:49| Ms. Horton. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm just curious on a couple of things. If this is a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:55| facility software that we're using for community use, and I don't, Mr. Dupler, have you signed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8815)|
| 2:27:02| agenda or this contract? Is there any issue with the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| Yes, number three, that new facility software. Do you want to go ahead and speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| Dr. Adams, while Mr. Dupler looks? Yes, Madam Chair, members of the board. So, Ms. Horton, it is a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| facility software. It's user-friendly for the general public, and this software will entail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:24| exactly what space the users will be receiving. It will include pictures, square footage, and so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:30| just makes our facilities use very efficient. Currently, we're using an old-school spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| with one person trying to manage. So, we're really just trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| enhance what we do as far as customer service. Yeah, that sounds great, and they also can pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:48| through that system. Is that correct? That is correct. Yeah, that's fantastic. I think that'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| be good for both the community and the school system. Yeah, it's really modernizing it. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8874)|
| 2:28:00| that's fantastic. Mr. Dupler. Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Horton. I've just looked at it. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:07| I don't, my signature is not on the printed agenda, but yeah. You don't see any problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:13| with it? Yeah, I don't have any issues with it. It came through procurement, so I mean the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| form is fine. Okay, thank you. Okay, Mr. Dupler, do you have any questions for Ms. Horton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8896)|
| 2:28:24| All right, moving on. Five or six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:35| seven or eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:40| nine and ten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8920)|
| 2:28:43| eleven or twelve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| thirteen or fourteen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8929)|
| 2:28:54| fifteen. All right, moving on to board policies. A or B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8934)|
| 2:29:06| C or D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| E or F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| G, H or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:24| J or K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| L, M or N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| Yes, Ms. Horton. Thank you, Madam Chair. I apologize, I was not able to attend policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8973)|
| 2:29:38| so I'm sure that this is clear to the rest of you. On D, D-140, which is, I think it's K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:46| it's M. Okay, so if you guys will look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:52| lines, the first part there that has an addition, lines 11 through 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:58| board of education allocations must be accompanied by an approved budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:03| These allocations must supplement, not replace, board obligations and must not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| include items that have been determined to be a board responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:16| That seems confusing to me. Is it just me? It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:26| Something doesn't seem right about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:32| because basically the receipt of school, of funds at the school level, it seems like we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:39| I don't know, it just, something's not quite right about that. I don't know if, Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:46| I think the comma could be the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:53| I think it should say supplement, not replace board obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| Okay, maybe that's the problem, is the comma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9057)|
| 2:31:06| Ms. Hemelgarn, do you have any comments on that? Yeah, Madam Chair, Ms. Horne, yes, we can go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| and look at the, I agree that the comma placement may fix that. The changes came from changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:19| internal school funds manual, but we'll go back and see if we can clarify that. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| that would be great, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9084)|
| 2:31:32| All right, any other questions on board policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| Okay, moving on to grants, number nine, A or B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| C or D. All right, contracts, A or B or C. There's only three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:58| All right, moving on then to regular agenda items, A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:06| Ms. Owen. No, I'm sorry, go on. Okay, C or C. Okay, there you go. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:22| I'm looking back at our release time policy and my question would be whether anyone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:30| done anything to look at the course already, whether our curriculum supervisors have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9150)|
| 2:32:40| evaluated that. In our policy, it says that the board and our curriculum supervisors are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| evaluate the course, and so I would expect us to see something from those supervisors before we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:53| on this. Dr. Wilson. Thank you, Ms. Owen, Madam Chair. So upon receiving the course MOU, we then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9173)|
| 2:33:03| asked for the syllabi to go with any courses they were going to be proposing. I did put those back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| with Catherine Schultz, who is our social studies supervisor, probably because it's closest related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| when you look at that, and they are referencing several history standards for that course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:17| and asked her to kind of look over the syllabus for additional insight, things she would ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| further clarification on. And so upon that, sent back to Mr. Schultz to ask for additional detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| be added to the syllabus, kind of taking into account what was included in the board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:34| and the state law in terms of what could be evaluated. I will say that the syllabus that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9214)|
| 2:33:39| have does outline kind of clearly the objectives, the text materials that would be used. It outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:46| the grading breakdown in terms of what weights would be placed and how often that would occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| within the lesson, or within the course, I'm sorry. And at that point, I mean, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:57| the level of evaluation that we have done. We haven't reviewed the text that would be used or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9237)|
| 2:34:02| anything of that nature, but really just looked at it more through the lens of do we feel like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9242)|
| 2:34:08| a course that is substantial, worthy of credit. Again, trying to review it through that secular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9248)|
| 2:34:13| lens, we understand the purpose of the course and what it is fulfilling in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:17| elective, and feel that they provided enough information that we feel it is substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| provides clarity to students that might be interested in signing up or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| for that course. But that's been the level of review that we've given to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:34| Okay, let me say this another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| So what the policy says is that to decide whether one elective credit may be awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:44| for a student's completion of a release time course, the board and Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| curriculum supervisors are to evaluate the course neutrally, etc., etc. So without hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9289)|
| 2:35:00| any kind of presentation of what has been specifically evaluated and how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| I don't see that the board is currently capable of evaluating. So before Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:14| I would have an expectation that we would have enough information for us to be able to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:24| So happy to provide that evaluation. Are there specific aspects of the course that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| like more information on? Because I'll have to make a specific request back to Mr. Shope if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:35| you're interested in like exact materials or... I would like to know exactly how our curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| supervisors have weighed all of those pieces so that we can understand that. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:53| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm asking this question more out of curiosity than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9353)|
| 2:36:01| I know that we can't nor should we approve or not approve an MOU like this based on the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| But I've tried to look up some things about Anchor Learning Center and I can't find anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| online about them at all. Does anybody know if it's a new entity? I did look up Mr. Shope and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| I just see him listed as an attorney in Farragut. But, I mean, is he...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| Yeah. Is there anything available to read more about them? I'm assuming if the class gets up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:30| and running like parents and others are going to want to find information publicly about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| Does anybody... Do we know? I didn't do a good deep dive on social media because I don't care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| that much. I'm just kind of curious. I know they don't have a website and stuff, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just to jump in there. So they've been trying to get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9405)|
| 2:36:54| ducks in a row and get all of this paperwork done and hire their teacher and that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| thing. So I'm assuming they will have those things. I'm assuming because they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| obviously want students to be able to come to their class. So I would assume that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| be forthcoming. Yeah. Just super fledgling at this point. Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:20| So just a couple of questions. Mr. Dupler, given the law, would it be appropriate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9440)|
| 2:37:27| curriculum supervisor to evaluate the course any further than what's been provided on our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:35| as far as specific content, that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:41| Thank you, Ms. Warren. Thank you, Madam Chair. I mean, it's kind of tough to determine, right? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9461)|
| 2:37:48| mean, obviously a curriculum supervisor can't dive deep into the material and critique the material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:56| due to the way the state law is based. But I can't give you a bright line as far as where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9476)|
| 2:38:09| evaluation would cut off other than it certainly needs to look, and I think Dr. Wilson talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:16| this, it needs to look like a high school level credit bearing course. So without diving deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:25| into the subject matter, does the syllabus look like that? Is the grading? I mean, you know, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:32| a lot of what he described, but it sounds like Ms. Owen wants some more, like a written evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:42| maybe a little bit more information, which again, I can't tell you where that would cut off, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| that, I mean, you can't start talking about the religious content as opposed to, you know, does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9528)|
| 2:38:57| that really look like a course that's comparable to a U.S. history course, right? Right. So I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9537)|
| 2:39:05| question would be, does the board have the same level of information for this class than we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9545)|
| 2:39:12| have for other courses that we add or, you know, because at the same level that the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:21| is looking at that for, to be sure that they are evaluating the course as they would any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:27| course, is the board doing that? So do we typically, I don't know that we ever get a syllabus for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9567)|
| 2:39:34| class when we evaluate it. This syllabus actually includes the related standards, so I would assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9574)|
| 2:39:40| we probably see that, but I'm just asking, when the board approves a new class, what level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| of detail is the board given? That's a good question. Dr. Wilson? Yes, so the only thing I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| is a parallel to that would be if we're determining a special course and by requirement of what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| to go to the state, those are usually developed by a team of teachers or a teacher and a syllabus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| is generally developed objectives, those types of elements that would potentially come to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| have to go to the state for application. That's probably the closest parallel. For things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| exist that are part of just kind of the state catalog, I don't know that that information ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| comes to the board for like English 1, English 2, those sorts of courses that are standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| but for special courses certainly because those courses are being developed by teachers and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9626)|
| 2:40:31| there's an application process back to the state, again by virtue of the fact of kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:37| defining for the state where does this fit into the social studies offerings and electives because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:42| they will generally drive you back to electives that already exist if you're trying to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| a special course that is essentially fulfilled by another one already in the state catalog. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:52| that's kind of the general reasoning behind that and generally what comes to the board. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| some special courses that are on the board agenda this month as well that are recurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| coming back for re-approval, if you will, in that. Okay, I just want to point out and let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:09| remember that this course in particular, parents have to sign that their kids are going to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:16| I mean, this is more of a parental, a parent's rights issue honestly because it's allowed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9676)|
| 2:41:26| state law that students can take advantage of this and so I think we have to be really careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9686)|
| 2:41:33| of trying to dictate or get too deep into what the content is as far as the specifics because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:42| that's really protected under the state law the way I read it. And I think we have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| sure that we're evaluating it as we would any other course. I would agree with that. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:58| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm not asking for additional pieces to be evaluated. I know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| our other curriculum is evaluated. That's been explained to us multiple times. I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9725)|
| 2:42:12| this is being evaluated and so I would like to know that so that that can be part of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| decision on whether to approve this or not. In our policy, that's what's supposed to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9737)|
| 2:42:24| and in the law, that's what's supposed to happen. So I would like our administration to provide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:29| us information regarding how it has been evaluated so that we can also evaluate it with those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:37| Any more discussion? Reverend Butler, you had your light on. You're good? Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:44| I don't want to speak. I want to do it. Okay. Okay. All right. Moving on to D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:57| And our final item, F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9777)|
| 2:43:02| Yes, Ms. Owen. Can we go back to the slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| Yes, Ms. Owen. Can we go back to E? Yes. I have a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:11| Looking at E, is there anything substantially changed by that name change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:21| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Owen. No, the only reason that it's back is just to clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9801)|
| 2:43:29| the name. I mean, the name of the entity is the overall entity that operates the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9809)|
| 2:43:39| Previously on the contract, it had the name of the school itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| This became necessary for two reasons. One, we needed to be accurate and it's a fairly simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:51| change. And then the other thing was with the state and state retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:57| they require that the overall entity be named. Got it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9837)|
| 2:44:07| All right. If there's no more discussion on our regular agenda items, we will move on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:12| public forum. Mr. Triplett. Thank you, Madam Chair. We do have some public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| Patricia Hammond. Patricia, if you will state your name and county residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| and then you'll have three minutes. I'm Patricia Hammer, Knox County resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240304-1?start=9864)|
