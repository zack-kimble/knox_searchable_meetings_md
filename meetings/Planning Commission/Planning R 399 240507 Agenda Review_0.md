| 0:00:30| Welcome everyone to the May 2024 Planning Commission Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| We have a light schedule today, and at this time I'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=36)|
| 0:00:44| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| I just have a few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| I guess first of all, I want to introduce you all to Kelsey Bousquet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| I think I pronounced her, I'm always afraid I'm going to butcher her name, but Kelsey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| has been with us for a little over a week now, and we're really excited to have her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| So you all will see her at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| She'll be working on rezonings, and then eventually probably some development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| review and be assisting us with telecommunication reviews as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| We don't get those very often, but when we do, Kelsey will begin assisting Lindsey Crockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| So welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| So this year's edition of the Development Activity Report is about to be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| It should be live on our website, if not today, in the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| So this is a summary of construction investments, rezonings, subdivision approvals over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| And so key takeaways from this year's report is we've seen a 30% increase in the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| of building permits issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| This is driven heavily by apartment construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| We've also seen some record-breaking investment in general in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| So for the first time, we'll be exceeding $1 billion in single-year residential construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| And some of the highest-priced projects are the Live Apartment Complex in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| at $81.5 million, followed closely by the multi-use stadium at $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| Again, our website will be updated, and we'll send you a link to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| We have kicked off the Areas of Opportunity Mapping Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| You've heard me mention this a couple different times, but this is a project that we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| on with the city, and it's focused on transit-oriented development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| So we'll be talking a lot about this over the next six to eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| And the county's first Comprehensive Land Use and Transportation Plan was recently passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| We're very excited to hit that milestone, and planning has been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=156)|
| 0:02:44| Planning staff have been working over the last week, two weeks, with KGIS to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| all of our online maps are updated to reflect the new plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| So that is now live on Planning Cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| And we're also working on updating all of our applications and schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| The plan amendments in the county will be heard quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| The first amendments to the new plan can be heard at the August 8th Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Now, we're in this transition period, so a lot of the applications that will be before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| you for the next couple months are submitted under the old plans, and so that's how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| will review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| So that might, hopefully that's not too confusing, but we'll try to lay that out as clearly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:29| possible in our staff reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| But it is required at the time of application that we provide a recommendation based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| the plans that were in effect at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| If you guys have any questions about that, please feel free to ask as we're reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| Planning Cases, or feel free to give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| In July, I'd like to have a training session with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| Ideally we could meet an hour in advance of your agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| We could have a discussion about if that time works for you all, but what I'd like to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| on at that meeting is reviewing the new plan and what plan amendments will look like, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| new criteria, kind of get you all up to speed on that, answer any questions that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| and then we'll just do some general training that we try to do once a year related to conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| of interest and other matters that I'll let Ms. Blakeney identify over the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| So hopefully that works for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| If not, these are training items that we can talk about at other meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| So those are all my updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Anything you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| So we'll jump into the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| So item number 16 is our first agenda item, 5J24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=278)|
| 0:04:48| And this is Whitney's case, I believe, or are we starting with number 18, 5L24RZ, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| was that one...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| So I can start with item 18, 5L24RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=295)|
| 0:05:22| So this reasoning request is for the 13-acre property on Harpy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=322)|
| 0:05:33| The applicant has requested to go from agricultural to PR up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| The property is located at the western edge of Knox County on the northwest side of Harpy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| and South North Shore intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| The area is predominantly zoned agricultural and PR with densities ranging from two to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| The planning commission approved a PR rezoning in January for the eastern property that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| can see in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| The land use classification of the southwest county sector plan is LDR, which permits consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| of PR zoning up to five dwelling unit per acre in the county's planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=377)|
| 0:06:26| The general development pattern in the immediate area consists of small lot sink detached subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| There is a commercial node less than one mile east at the intersection of Choteau Road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| From aerial view, we can see that Loudoun County has similar development to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=404)|
| 0:06:52| The subject property is an undeveloped forested land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| There is a blue line stream that essentially splits the property in two half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| The western portion can potentially be accessed by this stop out from that adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| The eastern portion is relatively flat and more likely to accommodate the entire density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| The eastern property for which the planning commission approved a density of three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| per acre does not have any such constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| Like Amy mentioned, while the sector plan was the active plan at the time of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| the property has the rural living place type under the recently adopted comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| This allows consideration of the PR zone with a density of up to two dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:55| Staff recommends approving the PR zone with up to two dwelling unit per acre since this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| would be consistent with the development pattern of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| PR zone is supported by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| The recommended density of two dwelling unit per acre considers the accessibility and environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| constraints of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| At the recommended density, a maximum of 26 dwelling units could be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| What was the, remind me, last month, I should know this, it was just 30 days ago, but southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| of this at the intersection of Harvey and North Shore, there was a similar track that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| had the blue line stream going through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Yeah, that one right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| What was the recommendation on it from staff and what did we end up doing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| That was a concept plan and development plan application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| The rezoning happened, I forgot the exact date, but it was probably more than 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| I may be wrong, but, yeah, it was zoned PR at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| It was actually part of the subdivision, the subdivision, so the entire property was zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:16| I forgot the date, but the recent case was just a development plan and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| Has there been a traffic analysis study for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Because I've been in that area a lot and traffic is terrible and the roads are crumbling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:41| As part of this application, it is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| At the recommended density of five tooling power unit, the estimated traffic is 698,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:54| which does not trigger the traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| Director Stone, did you want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| We actually were working with Canon and Canon right now to do, as part of the approval through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| the Town Affair Growth Policy Plan, the county committed to doing a small area traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| for the entirety of the Choteau Peninsula, so the intersection of Harvey at Choteau as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| well as the north, south, and east, west connectivity will be looked at later this year, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| our capital budget will be informed in future years to kind of identify some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=628)|

| 0:20:30| It's also near a planned expansion of the Loves Creek Greenway Trail, which is anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1230)|

| 0:20:43| This is the basis for our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| Miss Hillman or maybe Director Brooks, what's the history with these big chunks of RB in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:59| an LDR area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I feel like we've talked about it once before, but I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| You know, Mr. Reynolds might be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I think that the zoning's been there for a very long time, and probably when they updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| the sector plans, they chose not to recognize that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| But Mr. Reynolds, do you have more context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| My recollection is that the previous zoning ordinance to the current had RA and RB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1282)|
| 0:21:32| flipped, where RB zoning was the lesser intense zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| And when the new zoning went into place, they just gave the less intense RB zone the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| RB zone, which created a lot of out-of-character areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| I did look this up once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| It's been quite a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| I think that what I was told was correct or generally correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| So I think it was probably maybe a mistake or maybe it was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| But that's my—so these are really old legacy zones that are just there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| Yeah, I mean, they don't—when you zoom out there and kind of look at where some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| other RB areas are, it doesn't make sense with any of the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| So I guess my point is, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:36| I kind of have a dumb question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| This—Jeff, everything makes total sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| In general, when we're looking at—like, I understand that we're looking at the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| with the ordinances or whatever that was in place at the time the application was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| But we know that there's the new land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And so when we mention the new plan, are we supposed to try to make everything kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| mesh as we go forward, or are we trying to, like, just be aware of what's coming and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| just kind of that, like, these residential areas are going to be congruent anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Like, how am I supposed to think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Because we haven't updated our plan in 20 years, there's a little bit of new territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| So I don't think it's a dumb question at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| It's one that we've struggled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| We just feel like it's very important for you all to know, like, what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| And you can take that into consideration in your deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| And I'm certain that county commission will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Is that helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| So I've got kind of a follow-up similar to that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| In looking at the future plan, or it's really today's plan, but it's in the urban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| boundary, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I mean, there's quite a bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I mean, what, I guess to me, and I haven't, I was getting ready to try to look up what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| the actual wording was for the urban side, but I would think it borders the city and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| you know, urban is going to lean more towards higher density, even more so than the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| Am I assuming that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Or in the urban, you would see more density in urban zoning classification or planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| than planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I think in general, we would like to see more intense development where there's infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| And you'll generally find that in the more urban areas or planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| We'll move on to agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| I'm sorry, I missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Oh, yes, Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| This is item 27, 4Q24RZ for H24PA for J24SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| The subject property for this rezoning includes three parcels for a total of 15.07 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| Much of this acreage is in the Fourth Creek floodway and floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| It accesses Lyons Bend Road, which is a major collector street near its intersection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| South North Shore Drive to the west, which is a major arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| It's located across Fourth Creek from Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| It's also on the city county jurisdiction boundary, which you can see in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| The request is to rezone this area from RN1 to RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| The floodplain and hillside protection zoning overlays would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| The rezoning requires a land use amendment to the southwest county sector plan, the west city sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| and the one-year plan from low-density residential and public parks and refuges to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| The water, hillside protection, and stream protection areas would also be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:52| With the zoning map, you can see that the properties along Lyons Bend Road are zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| or low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| There is more intensive zoning across South North Shore Drive with RN5 townhouse developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| There's also RB general residential rezoning to the southwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| though that's not reflective of the actual residential build-out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| The residential land use classifications for this area are pretty much exclusively low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| or rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| The requested medium-density residential land use would be out of place in this expansive low-density area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| It's also noteworthy that in the hydrology section of the west city sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| it specifically calls out Fourth Creek as the waterway that is most prone to flooding in that sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| Aside from a couple townhouse developments to the west that were built in the early 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| most of this area is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| On Lyons Bend Road in particular, virtually all residences are single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| and lots are typically an acre or more in size and heavily wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| In the current aerial image, you can see how much of this property is consumed by Fourth Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| This image shows the TVA water level drawdown for fall and winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| but you can follow that shoreline to imagine how it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And in this 1935 aerial in the upper right-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| you can see that this lot was all once land before TVA dams and upstream development changed the hydrology of Fourth Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:31| At Lakeshore Park, you'll notice the new baseball fields that have been developed as part of their master plan improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| Lakeshore Park welcomes over one million visitors each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| It's a major regional attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| These ongoing changes to the park provide many benefits for the broader Knoxville and Knox County community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| but there have been concerns expressed by immediately surrounding residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| about noise and light impacts of developments like the sports complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| So the subject property being right next to these fields was a consideration in this rezoning review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| While you can see more intensive residential development along the major arterial street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Lyons Bend Road remains sparsely populated and very natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| This FEMA flood map shows the majority of the property is in the floodway in the 100-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| I discussed this property with plans and review and inspection staff as well as city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and learned that even with the flood-prone and waterway conditions there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| technically about five acres could be considered as lot area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| to be counted towards the intensity standards for residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| Meeting up to 72 townhouses could be considered here under R&3 through special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Staff are recommending denial of R&3 zoning and the medium-density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| The 2021 North Shore Drive corridor study found that Lyons Bend Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| heading towards South North Shore Drive, has a current level of service rating of E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| which means that there is unstable traffic flow with considerable delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| A signal was recommended for this intersection, but no improvements are slated to occur at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| The study states that with future growth, the level of service will deteriorate to a level F, as shown in this image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| This is also a vulnerable flood-prone area where more intensive residential zoning does not make practical sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| If there are concerns about noxious impacts of new recreation fields at Lakeshore Park on surrounding residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| then increasing the potential number of residents abutting those sports fields is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| Indeed, in the applicant's own letter of rebuttal to our decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| it appears that these new baseball fields may have played a role in motivating the applicant to move away from their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| The MDR classification would be in congress with the surrounding land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| which is almost entirely low-density residential or rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| The property also doesn't meet all of the location criteria for MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| which includes access to transit and sidewalk infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Lastly, the upzoning of this property violates at least three development policies in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| Those include policy 7.5 to protect the natural drainage systems associated with floodways and floodplains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| policy 11.1 to use environmental constraints and other factors to set standards for densities of residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| and 9.3 to ensure the context of new development does not impact existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| And in response to the applicant's letter requesting approval of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| it does mention a note in the staff report acknowledging an overall increase in population and housing demand as justification enough for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| If that alone warranted an upzoning, regardless of context, then we would never have a basis to deny one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| But considering traffic, hydrology, this new major sports complex, and surrounding residential character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| it's clear that upzoning this particular property may not be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| And these are our reasons for recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| I've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| So that bridge, I guess when you're looking at it, the east side, that goes to the KUB wastewater, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:26| That doesn't connect to the park, to Lakeshore Park, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| There's no access through there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| It appears to connect to the sewage treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So in looking at the ‑‑ you said how many potential townhomes at maximum intensity, 72 or six or something, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1900)|
| 0:31:52| Yeah, in looking at just the definition of lot area and lot area alone, five acres would permit consideration of 72 townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1912)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| I guess then could you or maybe Director Brooks explain to us what has happened with our one‑year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:17| and our land use classification table for LDR and MDR in the consideration of R and 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| Because if that would have passed council, then a plan amendment wouldn't be required for R and 3, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| At the time that this application was received, the one‑year plan had not been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| City Council ultimately determined that R and 3 is not appropriate in low‑density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and that R and 5 can be considered in medium‑density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Can you help me with ‑‑ I do remember I've worked with Director Snowden on the North Shore Corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:33:02| and I know that this intersection was contemplated for intersection improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| So I do know that that is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| The condo development across the street, I guess that would be the west side of North Shore there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| across the street, what's that developed at? Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| The ones that were developed in the early 90s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Yeah, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Because I know there's a condo complex right across the street there from the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| Chris, are you talking about the one that we approved an extension to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| No, that was a separate ‑‑ I mean, it was adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| But those were single family detached. These are condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| It's the Westlands, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| It was RP1 up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:08| And we assume it was built up close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| You mentioned something about disturbing natural waterways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| But is there consideration for that in the fact that this is not what it was naturally historically looked like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:44| It seems like this is a result of downstream adjustments, the amount of this that is floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2084)|
| 0:34:54| Is there any consideration in those plans for historic waterways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| The policy you're talking about is to protect natural drainage systems associated with floodways and floodplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| So you could interpret that to mean, you know, any altered waterway does not count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| But that may include all of our waterways to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| And if they were to build out in this, within the floodplain area there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| is there a limit of how far construction could go within these areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| Yeah, I'll defer to Joshua with city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| But I know that there's riparian buffer and TVA considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| Yeah, I would say that ultimately the maximum restriction would be the summer pool area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| which I believe is an 813 foot contour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| And the closer you get to that, it's still possible to develop, but it's harder and harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| You have the riparian buffer zone, which is 60 feet from that 813 contour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2168)|
| 0:36:17| which can get administrative approval from the engineering director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:24| Then there's the flow adjustment, which is at 822.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| They can technically go past that, but they'd have to go to TVA and do a no-rise study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| And then any development in the floodplain would have to be elevated, I believe, one foot above the 500 in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2196)|
| 0:36:47| It's kind of a weird situation that it's not a main river, but it's heavily affected by backwaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:56| So we haven't been able to get into the details to figure out exactly which rules would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| So I guess the short answer to the question, 813 is the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| but depending on how much money they want to spend, they could get closer and closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| And that's 813, but then there's still a 60-foot setback from the 813, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| Yeah, there's a 60-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| I mean, they could still get into that, but there's more hurdles and challenges to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2240)|
| 0:37:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Now we'll move on to item number 10, 4N24RZ, Masana Investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:58| Can I ask a question on that, Lake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| Are you saying that they can build lower than the 820 contour line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| Technically, it'd be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| They'd have to do a no-rise study and go through TVA, which, I mean, admittedly would greatly reduce what they could do in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:24| but there's plenty of developments that have developed in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Where they've gone and essentially brought it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| Yeah, they have to show that they're not affecting the elevation of the floodplain up or downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| and so usually that's cutting away from somewhere else on site and getting balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Just wanted to run through this application real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| 4N24RZ was postponed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| Staff's previous recommendation was to plan residential up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| The applicant is requesting five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| And the – let me get my pointer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| So you can see here that the property is just off of West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| This is Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| It's currently an agricultural zone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| It is cleared, and it's adjacent to plan residential to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Blacks Ferry Road, for the most part, is still agriculturally zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| There's a couple of outliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| There's a small RA zone property, and again, up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| And then there's a plan residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| It's an 18-unit development, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| So it's currently real residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| You can see around it, there's a lot of single-family, all these single-family developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| with the exception of the smaller development of Blacks Ferry Road, has connection back to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| This property only has access to Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Again, here's the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Plan residential to four is adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| It only has access to West Emory and was specifically prohibited from accessing Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| There's a small piece of legacy CA zoning at the corner of Blacks Ferry Road and West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| It's not used for commercial purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| As a matter of fact, part of this plan residential development here rezoned some CA property back to plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| Sector plan is all low-density residential in this area with some hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| I don't have a slide for it, but the future land-use map is suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| Actually, it might be regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| It's rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| No, it's rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| That didn't sound right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| And rural conservation would allow consideration of up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| just like the low-density residential does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| So there's really no change from that density standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| So there is a little bit of hillside protection on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| You see it's predominantly green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| It's kind of a smack dab here in the middle of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| So most of it is zero to 15 percent grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| There's a little bit of 15 to 25 percent grade in yellow and then some little outlier, steeper grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| And when you look at the aerial, this red area is pretty much the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| It's all been farmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| It's all been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| So it's really not much of a hillside area other than it does have some steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| The dashed blue lines indicate where our blue line streams across the property according to our base map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:51| Along the frontage of the property, really it only crosses the two access points that go up to Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:59| That is much more of a pronounced drainage area and might be a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| The other blue line stream or blue line that crosses the property is much less pronounced, but it is there and would need to be studied as part of a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:20| Blacks Ferry Road is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| It is about 16 to 18 feet wide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| But then going back to the Blacks Ferry Road intersection, site distance is very challenged here and is a safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2547)|
| 0:42:36| Something that would need to be looked at with development of this property would be improvements to Blacks Ferry Road and potentially this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:46| The star you see on the map here is approximately where this car is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| The red line is the county's minimum site distance, which is much further away than the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| The blue line is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| I can't get to my note on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I can't remember what the blue line was. It was a month ago that I created the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| But in either case, site distance is a problem and needs to be looked at and seriously considered with further development on Blacks Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2593)|
| 0:43:26| As I mentioned, we have changed our recommendation to four dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| It is consistent with the land use plan, but development on this road will require improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| As long as those improvements happen, the four dwellings per acre is consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| That is what we changed our recommendation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2624)|
| 0:43:54| You said, as long as the improvements happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| Well, improvements do need to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| We might be able to address how the county would build to ensure that those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2640)|
| 0:44:15| Sure, Mike. I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| The county has an ordinance that any off-site improvements required by Knox County or this body is codified in an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2658)|
| 0:44:28| That then is approved subsequently by a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| I've actually been talking to the Tennessee Department of Transportation because Emory Road is their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| They're doing an analysis to determine what they would anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| Depending on the trips generated, we would have some sort of prorated version of what the developer would be responsible for versus what the background traffic would generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:57| Then that cost share agreement would then go forward and be considered and approved by the county commission prior to the development moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:11| Thanks. I'm just trying to understand in terms of the recommendation that staff made that it's for assuming that the improvements are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2711)|
| 0:45:21| I guess, what happens if they aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| The MOU would codify the leverage the county would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| We wouldn't issue a grading permit or we wouldn't approve a plaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| There would be some kind of trigger for us to hold that would be codified and be understood and transparent for not only the county but the developer on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:46| I guess a clarification on that as well as we're moving into the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| That would normally get picked up at a development plan review or something like that, correct, that you would enter into an MOU, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2751)|
| 0:46:02| As we're moving into the new land use plan and the sector plans are being replaced, there won't be a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| A lot of that stuff will be used by right so it doesn't get approved by a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| But does that still just get reviewed by engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| Am I getting ahead of myself here a little bit? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| That might be just confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| We're still operating under our current zoning code and the residential zone that we see most frequently is the plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2790)|
| 0:46:39| So you all will continue to see those until the time that if and when that particular zone gets revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| So it will be coming back through as a development plan and a concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| And that's when that gets reviewed and all that happens. Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| Anything with six lots or more will be a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:06| We have one more to go. Number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I want to discuss this with you all because it does include a condition about disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:21| That went through the Planning Commission made a recommendation for the land disturbance limitation and the County Commission approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:30| This development does go outside of those boundaries a little bit, but as staff we're recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| So I just wanted to just go through our rationale for believing that this is acceptable and just generally the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:46| So they are requesting 103 units. I'm going to just zoom out real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| So this is the one on High School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| If you're familiar with High School Road, it's north of West Emory Road, west of the interstate as you're going to the northern part of the county towards High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:48:04| If you know where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| As you see, you know, Emory Road is down in the interchanges down in the far right hand corner of this image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:17| Existing land uses around this is pretty much all rural residential or I'm sorry, rural residential, single family residential or agricultural uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:28| This is the 2024 aerial for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| You see the where the disturbance is most prevalent in the middle of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| That's where the development will primarily be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| So it is only a very small portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| There'll be a lot of leftover buffers to adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| The issue comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| So it's kind of hard to see on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| On the aerial, but there's a red dashed line that outlines this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| Where the disturbance limitation is pretty much what you see on the south side as disturbed and then everything north of that back towards high school can be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:16| The 2014 aerial clearly shows that this property was disturbed entirely before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2956)|
| 0:49:25| So there's a very small portion of the property, a tree line near high school road that was not disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:35| And it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| And it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| What the development is doing is they're kind of pushing back just a little bit further into this already disturbed area outside of the disturbance line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:50| So they don't have to grade more towards the front of the property and then put more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:58| I guess potential for disturbance of the trees that actually are left towards high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| And since the backside of the property was disturbed previously as well, staff, we felt it was more appropriate to go ahead and let them continue towards the back of the property where there's a lot of buffer between them and the adjacent properties than trying to force the development back towards high school where there's grading issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:28| Flip back real quick just to the beginning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| I just wanted to run through a couple of variances and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| Another aspect of the property of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| We are asking for a right away stub out which they're providing to the adjacent property to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| They're having to push their entrance all the way to the north to their southern north, south, north, southeast property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:50:59| Basically, the adjacent property could never have access without variances and they would have to push their entrance right up against theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:07| If it ever had developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| So we're asking for the right of way stub out which they're providing so that they can connect into this proposed public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:19| Every single horizontal curve in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| They are asking for a reduction from the 250 foot minimum to, I think, hundred and 10 foot radius might be the smallest like up here in this, these turns, but the other horizontal curves towards their entrance is really just to try to reduce disturbance and to get up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:44| They are requesting a 15% grade in this portion of their entrance road, 22 foot wide pavement with to help again to reduce the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:59| There's a horizontal, not a horizontal curve, a intersection grade alternative design standard at the entrance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| So basically, a lot of it is because of the topography of the issues on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| There's a large power line easement on the west side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Everything's kind of getting compressed, which is the cause of these requests and staff is is supporting all of us want to point them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:29| And, as mentioned, staff is supporting everything we're recommending approval with the noted conditions in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3149)|
| 0:52:40| If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| I've got a couple of questions because I know I'm a big proponent of trying to keep the area that it appears to have refurbished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:57| It appears to have refurbished itself in the 10 years from the 2014 to 2024, which is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| So it's a bit disappointing to say, well, it's, you know, it's been cleared off at some point in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| So let's just extend it there, even though we had already said it wouldn't go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| I understand you're making some kind of compromises based upon what you described in terms of where it is positioned on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:26| I guess my question is, one, at what point in the process was that decision made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:37| That's really for my own edification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| When the applicant submitted, so I guess the first round of comments asked for an aerial showing their plan on top of the land disturbance limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3221)|
| 0:54:02| And that's when we realized that they were extending beyond it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| And then we had a conversation with staff like, well, they can move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| It's going to take a lot more grading on the front side of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| And is that really the intent of what the Planning Commission wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| There was a discussion of, well, we have to bring an access road in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| We don't know where that access road is going to be yet on the north side of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| So we don't want to limit them to just the driveway coming through from High School Road back to their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| That may not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| So we felt it was consistent with the intent of the condition to minimize disturbance as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:48| but also try to maintain on the High School Road side of the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| I was trying to balance that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| The other question is, was there ever part of the discussion that if the density that they were after was going to require the extension into the area that has refurbished itself over the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3299)|
| 0:55:17| that that density might need to be trimmed as opposed to trimming the trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3317)|
| 0:55:27| Just again, for my own learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| Staff's recommendation, I think, was two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| And it was ultimately approved at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| So that's what they can ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| If the Planning Commission has the authority to say, well, sorry, you can't go back further onto the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3343)|
| 0:55:56| If that's what you choose to do, they might just decide to move everything forward again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:56:05| I think ultimately they can get the number of units that they're wanting to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| It's just a matter of how they shift the units on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:21| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Any other matters that the Commission would like to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Just one real quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I noticed the agenda PDF links are not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| So I'm not sure if that's something that could be fixed before Thursday, but it would be amazing if so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| Which agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Like the full agenda or the agenda review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| The PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Both the agenda review and the full agenda PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| Neither of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| The links go to like a ‑‑ yeah, I think that Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| We'll double check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| That shouldn't be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| We'll get that fixed ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| We'll investigate what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Josh changed that a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240507-agenda-review?start=3448)|
