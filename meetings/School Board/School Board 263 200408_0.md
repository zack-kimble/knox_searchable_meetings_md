| 0:01:27| And thanks to all those who are watching from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| I know I speak on behalf of the entire board when I say how much we appreciate our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| and how well everyone is working together to support our students during this difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Tremendous efforts are being made to meet the physical needs of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| through programs like our food distribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| And as of this past Monday, offering academic support through the KCS at Home program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| So thank you to everyone who is working so diligently to make sure those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| If you need information about KCS at Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| all the information can be found on the Knox County Schools website at knoxschools.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| slash KCS at Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| To summarize it briefly for our families who do not have Internet access or a device at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| paper packets are available by grade band for pre-K, for K through 2nd, 3rd through 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| and 6th through 8th, as well as for student supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| The paper packets may be picked up at one of our meal distribution sites from 10 a.m. until noon on Mondays and Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=148)|
| 0:02:37| Due to the complexity of student schedules, resources and support for high school students is being provided online only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=157)|
| 0:02:46| As we have heard over and over, we have never experienced anything like this pandemic before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| And at times it seems like the decisions that are being made are very are being made very slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| But please know that our KCS administrative staff has been working diligently with local and state authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| to make sure that we are following all the state and federal guidelines that have been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| Our State Board of Education is meeting tomorrow afternoon, April 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| to address student attendance, grades and credits, as well as things directly affecting our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| We look forward to sharing more information as we receive guidance following that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| It may take a couple of days to get that guidance out, but we will have more information after that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| I also just wanted to take a minute to commend Superintendent Thomas and his staff for their leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| Hopefully you were able to watch the community meeting that was hosted yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| when they answered several key questions that were submitted by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| I think they touched on most all the questions that I had heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| If you did not get a chance to see that meeting live, the video and list of questions and answers are available on the KCS website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| And a link is available directly from the homepage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| And now I'd like to ask Mr. Superintendent Thomas if you'd like to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just just a few remarks here and I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| But first of all, I'd like to thank everyone who's gone the extra mile to serve our students and families during this difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| Our nutrition workers, teachers, security officers, principals and many others have done outstanding work to provide meals and educational resources during the ongoing health emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=262)|
| 0:04:33| And I'm very proud of their work. I think we're up over 200,000 meals after today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| As you know, our schools are currently closed through April 24th at the request of Governor Bill Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| I know this closure has prompted many questions from our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| I wanted to remind everyone that we held a virtual community meeting on April the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| That meeting is available on our website and I would encourage anyone with questions to watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Also, I wanted to remind everyone that our KCS at home program launched this week and is providing remote learning materials for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| The program is voluntary and completion of the work does not affect the student's grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| Grade specific packets and matching videos are available at knoxschools.org slash KCS at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| In addition, this site provides supports for students with IEPs and 504s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| We are also providing free breakfast and lunch meals for any child age 18 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| The meals are available from 10 a.m. to noon at 28 locations and you can find all the details on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| Finally, I'd like to wish everyone a very happy weekend holiday weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| I know these aren't the circumstances that any of us would have chosen, but we still have so much to be thankful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Please stay safe and thank you once again to the Knox County community for all your support during this difficult time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| Madam Chair, that concludes my remarks. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Before we approve our meeting agenda, I wanted to acknowledge that this electronic meeting format has presented some challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=356)|
| 0:06:04| especially with regard to our traditional public forum opportunity for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| So in an effort to offer the public a way to submit comments and questions prior to our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| we have set up an email address and all messages received will be be forwarded to all the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| The email address is board comments at not schools, not org board comments at not schools, not org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| And this was also shared in the public notice for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| So far, we have not received any messages in that inbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| But if any of those anything is received, it will be forwarded to all board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| And we will continue to utilize that email address going forward for future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Also, as you know, we made the decision to cancel our work session that was scheduled for last Wednesday and combine our work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| our discussion of the agenda tonight for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| So we will go through the agenda for discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| And then I'll ask Miss Courtney to read the items for voting purposes following our agenda following our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=427)|
| 0:07:15| We will take a show of hands to vote on approval of the agenda and the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| And then we'll take a roll call vote on each of the items in policies, grants and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| So that will be a little bit tedious, but we're trying to make sure that we follow the guidelines we've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| So. So bear with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| So with that, do we have any requested changes to this meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=457)|
| 0:07:45| Hey, do we have a motion for approval of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| OK, we have a motion by Mr. Norman, a second by Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| All in favor. Show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| OK. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Now we will go to the discussion of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Let me just sign that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| OK. Do we have any discussion or any questions on the first contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=494)|
| 0:08:28| OK, let me see. I'm trying to position this so I can see you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| OK. OK. Anything on the contract to I'm sorry, the consent on the consent agenda item two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=512)|
| 0:08:47| Anything on four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| OK, Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| Yeah, I just want for public because this one is about paying for a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| And I know with all the current stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| And I think I've gotten clarification about this, that we are just approving that they have the ability to go on this trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| We're not making payments at this point. And I just want to make make sure that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| Dr. Reiswick or Mr. Trent, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=554)|
| 0:09:25| I guess, John, you want me to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| You're going to Virginia. I couldn't hear some of that. Would you come back to me, please, on the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| Sure. I just want to make clear for everyone, because this one's about paying for a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| And just with the current what all's going on with canceled trips and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| I just want people to know that this is actually just us approving that they have the ability to go on the trip, that we're not actually going ahead and paying for this trip at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| Is that correct? Yes, ma'am. OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| All right. Thank you. OK, moving on to item six or seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=596)|
| 0:10:08| OK, we'll move to board policies. Any questions on J-110?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=608)|
| 0:10:17| Satterfield, did you have a question? I'm looking at it on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Oh, OK. I'm sorry. I think you were frozen for a second. OK. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| Any questions on D-110? Yes, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=627)|
| 0:10:38| Yes. Just on this one. Do we have any type of timeline at all on the budget at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=638)|
| 0:10:49| Go ahead. I was just going to jump in. Ron can also jump in on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| But I think Ron McPherson has been in contact with Chris Caldwell and I believe on our May agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| The expectation is we would have our budget on the May agenda and we should be receiving our first BEP estimate sometime here in the next few days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=660)|
| 0:11:09| So. So the May board agenda and Ron, if I left out anything, jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| No, that's that's correct. OK, thank you. OK. And Mr. Dupler, if I could ask a question on this one, since we are voting to we're approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=674)|
| 0:11:26| we would be voting to approve the suspension of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| This that's that is just a temporary suspension. Can you just kind of review what that means for the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| So that's true. It's just it's just for this year. It's just a temporary suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Frankly, this this policy needs to be amended at some point anyways, because it refers to a deadline of April 15th in the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=704)|
| 0:11:54| The deadline is actually May 1st. And for the past two years, the board has gone past April 15th closer to May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=714)|
| 0:12:04| So so that's one thing that's going to need to be changed going forward. However, I mean, this this particular change is on your agenda is just for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| And county commission will need to weigh in fairly soon so that so that all this can can occur basically a month late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=733)|
| 0:12:23| I mean, that's that's the projection at this point. Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Any questions on that policy? OK. And Mr. Dupler, if I could ask another question, I guess we will also need to come back and reinstate that policy at a specific time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=748)|
| 0:12:45| So perhaps in May we we would need to do that. No, I mean, I mean, this is just a temporary suspension of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| But but but I would recommend going to the policy review meeting at some point soon and amending the policy to to to mirror the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=774)|
| 0:13:05| OK. All right. Thank you. OK. Any questions on grants A, B, A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=785)|
| 0:13:18| OK. Grants C or D. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| Moving to contracts with any questions on any on contract A, B, C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=804)|
| 0:13:44| OK. And I think I think everyone is aware that these were these items were the ones that were really time sensitive that could not be pushed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=824)|
| 0:13:54| There were several there were a few things that may have been pushed to me, but but nothing that was time sensitive that would create any kind of issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/schoolboard263200408?start=834)|
