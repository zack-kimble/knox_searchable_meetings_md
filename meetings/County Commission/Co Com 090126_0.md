| 0:00:35| I will let you lead the Pledge of the Flag, if you will, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=35)|
| 0:00:38| Right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| Join me in standing and saluting our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=40)|

| 0:00:51| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=51)|
| 0:01:10| Does everybody have their agenda? Mike, you got one, and Bud, you all got the agendas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| I think Commissioner Burroughs needs an agenda. Oh, you got one? You want to share with Tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| Okay. All right. Okay, you've had the minutes that were emailed to you. Do I hear a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=81)|
| 0:01:32| for approval? Second. The December's meeting, first and probably second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed, like sign. Okay. Mr. Wall, Director, if you will swear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=99)|
| 0:01:46| in those that plan to testify today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For anyone who is appearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| before this board this afternoon, and you intend to give testimony or otherwise address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| this board, please stand, raise your right hand, and be sworn. I'm coming in, Mike. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=117)|
| 0:02:06| you go. You solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you'll give here today will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| Mr. Chairman. The witnesses have been sworn. Okay. Clerk, we'll start off with number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| item number five, 5A. 5A is a consideration of suspension and revocation for a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| at Mr. Zipp's store, number 522-5515, Strawberry Plains Pike. Mr. Zipp of Tennessee is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| owner. This is a first offense. Who's going to present this case? If you would, sir. Alan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=151)|
| 0:02:57| Wolfie May, Moscow Sheriff's Office. On December 11th, 2008, we had an undercover sting operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| at Mr. Zipp's market. Our undercover officer went in and purchased a six-pack of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=187)|
| 0:03:17| Her name was Karen Faye Dean, and that's about it. Wolfie, did they show any ID, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=197)|
| 0:03:33| what happened? Give some details. They did show ID, and they still sold, and our undercover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| officer, she's 20. Sir, state your name for the record. My name is Dwayne Haney. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| district coordinator with Mr. Zipp Convenience Stores. We heard the testimony of the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| investigator. Sir, do you admit or deny that this occurred? Admit. And this is a first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| offense, Wolfie? Yes. Yes. Okay. I'll defer to the board. Commissioner Hammond. Sir, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=240)|
| 0:04:12| are you doing? Is the person still employed? They are not. She was suspended when this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| happened. It's my understanding that she has moved back to Alabama. And what are you doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| to make sure that in your stores that you're making sure they comply? Well, besides the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| training program we have with a new employee, all of our employees go through the tips program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| We reinforce each month with a newsletter and with conversation that we have to ID everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| We have to look at the ID. And the one thing I tell them is, if they're under 21, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| red flagged. There is a red outline, a red border on this. Just hand it back. Don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| think about it. Just hand it back. I really don't know what else to do. I'm sorry. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| have a machine that also reads the IDs if the clerk uses it. They scan the ID. It says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| tells the age. They have to use them. And obviously she didn't. Mr. Chairman, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| the first offense, I'll move that we do a $500 fine or 30-day suspension. His choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| This machine that you would, was your machine operable in the store that day? As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| I know, yes. It is operating today and it was the next time I was in the store. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| she just didn't use it. She simply did not use it. If they scan that machine, what? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| sorry? Over here. If they use that machine, what happens? I mean, you say they scan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| license or whatever. How does that work? The driver's license has a barcode on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| And when you scan it, it simply gives you the name and the age. You're supposed to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| at it and make sure the name matches the name on the card. And of course, it tells you 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| 22, 25. Tells you the age? Yes, it does. Does it red flag or anything? Say no sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| or sale? Yes, it will say no sale and underage. Sorry, Larry. That's not a problem. What would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=358)|
| 0:06:08| be your preference? The $500 fine or the 30-day suspension? The $500 fine. You need a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| which I will provide. Okay, thank you, Commissioner. I've been properly seconded. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| of a $500 fine? Aye. Opposed, like sign? Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Okay, Clerk, 5B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=381)|
| 0:06:32| This is a consideration of suspension and revocation for the beer permit at TRJ Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| and Enterprises, LLC at 8119 Chapman Highway. State your name for the record, sir. My name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=397)|
| 0:06:51| is Jim Horton-McLughan. All right, thank you, sir. If you'd just give us a moment and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| have the Sheriff's Beer Inspector, Investigator, state the case, if you would, sir. Also on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| December 11th, 2008, we went to the Pioneer Market, 8119 Chapman Highway. Same undercover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=424)|
| 0:07:13| officer went in, showed ID, they still sold, and bought a six-pound bottle of beer. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=433)|
| 0:07:21| went in right after that and wrote a citation to Tammy Lynn Russell, who was the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=441)|
| 0:07:31| there. And this is likewise a first offense? Yes. Any issues prior to this in recent memory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=451)|
| 0:07:42| Not that I recall. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Commissioners. Again, what has happened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| the employee? She's terminated. She's not working there no longer. And what actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| are you taking to? I'll be adding more training and then I'll reprogram the registers where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| they have to punch the dates in. If not, it's just the red flags, not the sale. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| Brown. Did you say you do have the machine to read the driver's license also? No, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| have the machine that reads it, but they have to punch the dates on the register. Whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| a beer scans, they have to punch the dates in. And if underage, it'll flag out. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=502)|
| 0:08:34| Mr. Hammond, did you have anything else? No, I was going to make a motion, a $500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| or 30 days at his discretion. Sir, what would be your? I'll pay $500 fine. Second. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| It's been properly seconded. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed? I'm sorry. It has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=525)|
| 0:08:52| lights on. I had a question. So what do you have them punch in? You have them punch in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| their birth date? Birth date, yeah, on the register. Okay. All right. Thank you. Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| in that particular instance, what did they punch in that allowed the sale to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| You bypassed it. I guess I'm concerned because we hear this all the time. And I know others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| have asked this question. The disposition seems to always be the employees terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and so forth. And I don't know if it's the first time she or he had encountered the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=561)|
| 0:09:30| I'm just not real sure that that's an effective way. Obviously, it's not because this keeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| occurring. Effective way of dealing with it. It may be if it's been a multiple situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| with that person. Now, I'm not speaking directly to you, but to everybody, because that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| the solution always seems to be. And trying to figure out how we go beyond that. Sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| they're young and they don't, they haven't, the training hasn't taken as you think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| perhaps it has. I don't know. But it's frustrating to sit here and hear the same thing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| month in and month out. And we don't seem to be moving toward a solution. That bothers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| me. So, I simply express my frustration and I guess we'll go ahead with the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| I mean, as long as they're coming before us and it's their first defense, I mean, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| We had some other lights that were still on, so may have changed some people's votes. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| let's vote to suspend, to re-vote. And the vote was for $500 fine. Let's vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=625)|
| 0:10:33| right now. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed, like sign. Okay. Well, we've got a real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| question for you. The person, the lady that went in and did this, when it, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| if you even know the answer to this or not, Wolfie, but does, do they, does it come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| like that and she tries to say, oh, just sell it to me anyway, or does she just go up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| hand them her card, get the beer and says nothing and just see what she does? How is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| this happening? We make them use their real ID, their driver's license. And they go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=658)|
| 0:11:06| they can't be like run through the washer. You have to be able to identify. And there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| not any misprints or anything else. It's a real driver's license. It's not been abused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| or, you know, where it's faded or anything else. Most of the time, they look at it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=677)|
| 0:11:24| sell anyway. We've had several instances at different places that where they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| put it in a register, it rings no sale, and they still sell also. It just doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| if it's a young clerk or an old clerk. We've done them from, you know, 18 years old to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| 65 years old. So it doesn't really make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| When it shows up no sale, they try to talk them to sell it to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| They just shut up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| All our people do is they sit the beer on the counter, lay their driver's license down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| and that's it. They either sell or they don't sell. We don't try to, oh, come on and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| When they pass it, Wolfie, do you let them know that they were just tested or do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| get complimented for doing the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| We go in, Lieutenant Brummett and I, we go in the store. If they pass and we tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| we get the clerk's name, and then the sheriff's office sends a letter to the company or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| store saying that they did pass the test at underage sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| Yeah. We need to congratulate them if they're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Okay. Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| The next item is 6A. It's a deferred application for Donald Ray Wood at Donnie's Tavern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| 1606 Merrillville Pike, on and off premises, formerly BJ's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| Here it comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=776)|

| 0:20:06| Do I have to fill out another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| He has to fill out another application or just come in next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Come in on the present application so we can see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Item 8 is an update on the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Dollar General Store number 9808 at 7603 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| Dolgen Corporation, Inc. is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Was this here, Mr. Minot, was this here at your request placed on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Before yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Dollar General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Chairman, they come before the beer board in looks like April of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1248)|
| 0:20:57| and it was pending fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| And I took a notice out there, and I've been back, and they said they'd be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| but I don't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| So at this juncture, we still have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Mr. Fire Marshal, you want to elucidate on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Last beer board meeting, they still hadn't called back for a re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| I sent an e-mail to Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Smith that detailed our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| involvement with it to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| They, as of Friday, I had called, I want to say Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| last Wednesday to try to get an update from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| He didn't call me back until late Friday, and as of late Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| he still wasn't complete with all of his issues that needed approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| So as far as we're concerned, it still does not have fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Was he advised to be here today, Mr. Minot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Yes, sir, he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| How so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Was he given formal notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| I think if he went after it, there would be a sticker still on the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| And I talked to him too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| So according to the clerk, we've got written notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| and you've posted it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I'll defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| UK, thank you for going out and all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Chip, let me ask you this real quick, and I know you're busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| and a lot of these is that they've just not called you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| Do you have anybody, are we able to have anybody from your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| as it gets closer, that they could call just to remind, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| we've not heard from you yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Are we doing anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Yeah, I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Yeah, I know you did on this case, but others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| are we doing anything like that for ones that you haven't heard on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Typically, I mean, you know, if it goes this far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I'm calling them probably a couple of times a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| but on the normal one that, you know, they've got plenty of time to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| On our report, we indicate and have them initial that they understand it's their obligation to call us back for reinspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| If it's just your normal inspection and there's not, you know, anything over and above, then they do call us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1391)|
| 0:23:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Now, they don't always get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I mean, sometimes they think they're done, and they're actually not done when we get out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| but, you know, this one is abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| There have been a couple like this that have been abnormal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| and when that happens, we try to stay on top of it by constantly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| trying to get information on them as to whether or not they're complete or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| But, you know, the things that he has still to do are mostly just reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1422)|
| 0:23:50| and documentation that he needs to submit to us that he never has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| and he sent me an email listing the things that he still needs to do on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| So, I mean, he's well aware of what it is we're asking him to do, has been made well aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| and just hasn't been able to pull it all together yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Let me ask you, UK, or the law director or the clerk, how long do we go with these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| How long do we keep them on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| If they don't respond back in six, do we just take it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Are we allowed to do that, or do we suspend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Our application does not have an expiration date, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| It seems incongruent that a reputable business like this would not cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| I would suggest that my office sends a letter directing them to be here next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| to give cause why we should not honor the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Because I don't think they're getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Maybe this will jar their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| We talked about this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| You said he sent you an e-mail on Friday listing things that he had done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Had not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Had not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| What items were on that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| He needed to provide us with copies of the sprinkler inspection report, the clean sprinkler inspection report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| In other words, once he had the sprinkler heads installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| the sprinkler contractor has to certify to us that the installation was done per NFPA 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| which is the code for sprinklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| But you're talking about the ones underneath the duct work now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I haven't seen them, so I don't know that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| But the assumption from reading this is he's installed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| But that was not asked for when they got a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| This only came about when they hired an outside firm who wanted to do more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| No, this came about because they are required by state law to have an annual sprinkler inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| How did they get a certificate of occupancy for the building without that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| I wasn't the person that conducted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Regardless, it boils down to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| We're not the sprinkler contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| It's the sprinkler contractor's obligation to do the inspection and to certify to us that it meets code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| He hasn't been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| But when you did your inspection, this was not on your list of things to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| It only came up when the outside company did their inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| When I did my inspection, he had not had his sprinkler system inspected by a state licensed contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| I directed him in my report to have the contractor do the inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| and provide us with a copy of the sprinkler contractor's inspection report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| When he did have it inspected, that's when the sprinkler contractor identified it as an issue on the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| And at that point, I still haven't actually received the report, but he showed it to me on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| He didn't have means to copy it, and it was noted that the sprinkler heads had to be installed under the duct work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| And I explained to him then that because it was noted on the sprinkler inspection report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| that it would have to be completed as part of this inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| What we're looking for is a clean inspection report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| If the sprinkler contractor gives us a clean inspection report, then it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| But if he doesn't, if he lists deficiencies with the system, we can't approve it until those deficiencies are corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Any other items on that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Oh, yeah, he's providing us with documentation that all the leaks in the roof have been repaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1650)|
| 0:27:39| and the same thing on the fire alarm system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| We still haven't received a clean inspection report on it, so we're waiting for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| Those are the three issues that he listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| As to whether or not any of the other issues that I noted have been taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| I have no idea because he's never called back for a re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| I mean, I had a whole list of stuff that was noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| He's telling me these are the only three items left, but I have not done a re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| I'm just wondering if he's not getting discouraged by having to do something that you say is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| or they say is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| I went out to take a look at this, and when you look at a ceiling that high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| and say you've got to have a sprinkler underneath a ductwork when you've got them on both sides of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| it's just superfluous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I attached a copy of the code to the e-mail that I sent to the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| That is the code that's been adopted by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| I mean, it's not our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| It's what's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| I can only tell them what the code requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| On them codes that's been adopted by Knox County, if it's a billboard code, we have to notify them by letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1731)|
| 0:29:01| Either I take it to them or the clerk's office if there's a change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| Now, this place, I was just looking at the permit to occupy the building was done in 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1746)|
| 0:29:17| The fire marshal, building inspector, all of them checked off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| I've got no problem, but if it's a dangerous place, it ought to be closed down, my way of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| or cited to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| It shouldn't have anything to do with a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| The law department will, as I said, they're going to send out a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| and Commissioner Anders will be at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| Let's just wrap it up next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| Do we need to inform motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I'm so advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Be so advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| UK, anything else you want to say on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| The next item is item nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| It's consideration of referring the proposed changes to the Knox County alcoholic beverage ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| to the full commission for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Mr. Chairman, members of the board, you have several documents before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| One of them is the current code, which you see is approximately one and one-quarter pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| Our beer code has not been updated since 1996 in any kind of comprehensive fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| Since I've been representing the beer board, the board has advised me to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| One, ensure that the hours of sales are in congruent with or come into congruence with that of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1833)|
| 0:30:41| and secondly, to afford us the opportunity to be a bit more enforceable relative to penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| The only other changes you see in the proposed ordinance before you are those which are mandated by state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| or preexisting sections that are pretty much helter-skelter throughout various books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| but never codified into one cohesive document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| So, again, we are not suggesting, I say we, the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| is not recommending any changes to the current state of the law nor the way we do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| except for those two items that were directed by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| But this does put into codification a singular document that makes it a bit more defensible for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| those laws and regulations we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| For instance, the Responsible Vendor Act, that's mandated by state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| We don't have any levity there at all, nor discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Those required hours of operation are likewise regulated by the state in terms of the end hours of sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1894)|
| 0:31:44| The penalty section, again, is congruent with that which you've had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| except a little more enhanced for nonresponsible vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| I'll stand for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Any questions for the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| In pertaining to the Responsible Vendor Act, since this is a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| do we have to, by letter or some form, notify each of the current permit holders of this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1922)|
| 0:32:12| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| The Responsible Vendor Act is a voluntary program for vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| although the statute is written in such a fashion that it encourages local government to educate our vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1936)|
| 0:32:24| But we're not required by law to actually contact them because it is, in fact, a state program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| But the state program mandates that it be consistently applied to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| In fact, the way the statute reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| the purpose of it is to uniformly apply all provisions in this part statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| including training certification and the imposition of penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| or the sanctions for violations of this part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| and that no variations from the provisions on training certification or penalties are permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| So, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| To answer your question, which is a good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| we should have a duty to let them know it's available to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| but they're not required to comply with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| It's just to their benefit if they do because it gives them one added level of protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| So they can still opt out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| Yes, sir, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| With regards to I saw a notice in there, and maybe this is part of the old law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and that is if someone wanted a one-day beer permit, they could come before this board and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Is that correct for a nonprofit if they were having some type of festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| That's generally designed for special events, everything from, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| a local service club wants to have a special event at a golf course in which they want to sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| or some other special event, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| So one-day permits are permissible if brought before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| And this has always been there because in checking before, we were told that you couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| So if a nonprofit comes before the beer board and say, like you mentioned, the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| but let's say they're having like a street fair or some type of one-day festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and it would only be for nonprofits, it would not be for a for-profit, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| It has been here for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| The distinction being that we have the right to refuse that one-day permit if it's on county-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| So, for instance, they said we want to have a temporary permit, we want to do it in your park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| we'd have the right of refusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Any other questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Any other agencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| UK, thank you for bringing that to our attention on this selling the beer to coincide with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| I think that's a very good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I appreciate your leadership in that role that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| Just for a point of clarification, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| This is a first reading, which means that the hour change that we voted on at the beer board last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| this constitutes the first reading of that particular item also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Well, sir, it actually won't be considered a first reading until it goes to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| That's what I mean, at today's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| If you move this forward to the full commission, today will be the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| I want to be sure everybody understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Item number nine, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Do I hear a motion to approve and pass this on to the county commission, the full body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| I'll make a motion we approve it and send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Any other discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Mr. Law Director, or assistant, whatever your title is, thank you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| Any other items to come before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| If not, do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| We're ready to start our January commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2172)|

| 0:37:11| Our devotional will be led by David Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| I pledge allegiance by Commissioner Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| And in our devotion, I would like for everyone to say a little prayer for the Anders family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| Brad had lost his grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Will you, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Let me stand down here for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Maybe if I get to shaking, you all won't see it, and it'll just be a show for the people that are behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| But I'd like to draw our attention to a couple of things that happened in the news in the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| One was an airplane crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| And the other was a man in the Carolinas that had been declared dead, and 60 minutes later, he had a faint pulse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2270)|
| 0:37:59| The plane crash in New York was referred to as the miracle on the Hudson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| And I would refer to someone that had been clinically declared dead that had a faint pulse 60 minutes later, that to be a miracle also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2284)|
| 0:38:17| So where do miracles stand with us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Some recent surveys have said that maybe 75, as high as maybe 75 percent of us, think miracles do occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2300)|
| 0:38:31| This reminds me of an old story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| A fellow that couldn't see very well, in fact, he'd lost his sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| had heard that a man in a neighboring village had been traveling around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| and had fed several thousand people with just a few fish and maybe a few pieces of bread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| He thought to himself, and he had a belief, that maybe if I can get over there, this person can do something for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| But being without his sight, he said, how am I going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Well, he did what we normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| He called on a couple of friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| He made his way to the other city, and lo and behold, he ran into this person that he was wanting to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| That person asked him, what can I do for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| To which the blind man said, well, I don't see very well, and I think you can help me with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| Sure enough, the man reached out and touched the man that had poor vision and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| and I paraphrase, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| The man without any sight thought to himself, just a second, this is not working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| Things are really dim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| He responded and said, the world is gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I see what looks to be like trees walking around with arms and legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| He was touched again, and his response then was he had clear vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2388)|
| 0:39:57| What I bring to us today is some of the points that are in this simple story mean quite a bit to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| First off, we have to believe that things can be done a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| Second, sometimes you've got to get your friends to go with you, to help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| And third, it may not be the first time that we get the thing right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| It may take a second time or a third time or a 23rd time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| but we have to stay after the business that we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| I'll ask you to bow your head for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| And I pray, I pray the blessings of heaven upon all the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| and especially those of us gathered in this room today to do its business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Let's stand for the pledge to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| You'll face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2476)|
| 0:41:25| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| The first item on the consent calendar, R-09-1-101, if we could remove that from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2493)|
| 0:41:42| And if I could ask that that be moved to the front of the agenda so we can let Mr. Hick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Yes, I'd like to have an item moved forward at the best convenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| and I think you have it written down on the pension report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| 8-0-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add the Hillcrest sale to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2523)|
| 0:42:19| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| I would like to put on the agenda we're in dire needs of money in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| not only on the sheriff's pension plan, but two other plans, the school and all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| We need this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| We're running short on revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I've always said we never should sell property assets we own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| but right now we're back in the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| and I would like to add on the agenda to sell Hillcrest Nursing Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| put it out for an RFP for a minimum of a $22 million bid on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| to be sure that all our indigent care and Medicaid patients are taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| Of course, that's a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I've asked the law director to look at the state law on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| and it be a cash sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| And I'm sure most of you read my post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| There's a few more things on there that I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| I'd like to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2601)|

| 0:43:30| It will be put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2610)|

| 0:44:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I wasn't paying proper attention and I was curious about Mr. Wright's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=2663)|

| 0:53:14| The procedure we're going to have is we're going to each commissioner will be able to select,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3194)|
| 0:53:25| nominate one person if they so choose or pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3205)|
| 0:53:37| And then, of course, we will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| And the least amount that a person gets, if it's zero or one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| they will be taken off the list and then we'll keep on until we have one person that gets ten votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| The audience, if someone would like to say something, we would allow that very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| Commissioners, do you think that we need to ask the applicants to say something else or are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3240)|
| 0:54:08| I'm ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Yeah, before we vote on this, I've spoken with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| and there's something that I believe we need to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| After the last meeting, me and Commissioner Smith had a very brief conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| He basically asked me who I was going to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| and he reminded me of an incident that happened out in Powell with Lillian Williams' husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3279)|
| 0:54:50| and said that Irene McQuarrie, our county's Republican party chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| and the mother of another candidate said that she wanted me to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| and realize that remind me of this unfortunate event that took place at the Powell Republican Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| and wanted me to be sure and know that she had defended me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| And so I felt like that was an attempt at lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| And I know we're people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| We all talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| And for the most part, if we say something privately, we usually cure that by saying the same thing publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| But this was one thing that had not been repeated publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| so I felt like to be in good conscience that this needed to be brought forward before we cast a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| so that we can cure any possible Open Meetings Act violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| That's why I wanted to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| I gave a letter to the law director and I just simply wanted to put this on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| so that somebody doesn't come back later and holler Sunshine Law on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| Mr. Law Director, have I adequately handled that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| If you've related everything that occurred, that's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| I believe I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Is there anything that I missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| It was an Open Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| It was in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| It was just not said in microphone and on to where it was a part of the official record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| is why I felt out of an abundance of caution that I should bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Mr. Chairman, are we going to go around the room and make nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| or how are you going to make the nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| We're going around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I'll just wait until my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3399)|

| 0:56:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| I just want to disclose that Bruce Williams, who's the husband of Lillian Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| who's one of the candidates, did some work for me at my house within the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| I had actually asked him to do this prior to Scott Moore's trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| It was back in the summer, but I did want to go ahead and disclose that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| although that does not have an influence on my vote here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3429)|

| 0:58:55| Mr. Chairman, there's a lot of good candidates that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| We had a lot of good interviews from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| You know, it's not about what I want from the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| It's what 7B represents, some 40,000 people in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| And the candidate that I've heard most of from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| and the one that they've asked for overwhelmingly in support is one most familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| and the one that they trust the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| This individual has no ties with Knox County through its employment or its family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| Importantly, this candidate is an independent thinker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| and this candidate in the interviews they felt gave the most detailed answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| and this candidate and its family members have done more in the community over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| and the best known throughout the total district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| And the bottom line, commissioners, this candidate is the one that I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| and I and the people of the 7th District can trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3596)|

| 1:00:44| I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| I just thought I heard Commissioner Smith say that Michelle Carringer had no ties to county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| and that she did not work for county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| and my understanding was that she worked for Kathy Quist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and I just wanted to know if something has happened that I didn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| The correct word was was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| She no longer works for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| She told us at the meeting if she came and she got the job, she was resigning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| and I think she has already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Has she already resigned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3673)|

| 1:03:49| Three of them got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| The count is Carringer, eight, Ross, two, Severance, two, Weaver, two, and Williams, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3837)|
| 1:04:07| So I'd like to change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| He's already announced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Yes, I already announced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| I was just going to change it to make it easier to drop one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| We, Ross, Severance, and Weaver will drop off, and it will be between Carringer and Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| Mr. Chairman, point of procedure, I believe we dropped the person with the lowest vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| All of them have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| We have three with the lowest vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| I'm saying all three of them we dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| I don't think that's proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| I believe in past places we have simply had another round of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| The law director told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I believe it says singular person with the lowest vote, and if there is a tie, we don't drop anyone with the lowest vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| We just vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| That is past procedure that has been followed by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| I think Commissioner Harmon is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| I'll let the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| He's the one who instructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| Be on the safe side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3902)|

| 1:05:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| That's the way I recall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| That's the way it's been done in past nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| The law director has changed his advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3914)|
| 1:05:25| We'll have the vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=3925)|

| 1:11:40| Well, we have quite a few commissioners doing their paperwork and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4300)|
| 1:11:46| I want to call up Superintendent Dale Dickinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| He wants to address us on the 75th anniversary of the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4311)|
| 1:12:02| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you for the opportunity to sneak in on, I know, a very busy agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| I have with me Deputy Superintendent Kevin Fitzgerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| and we are excited about this year in the history of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| I'm sure many of you saw yesterday's Knox Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| and there's wonderful stories about the history and the deep roots of Great Smoky Mountains National Park in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| as well as several other counties in East Tennessee and Western North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| The park was established on June 15, 1934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Some of you, I suspect, have families or have some heritage, and you realize there were earlier dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| the turn of the century when an idea of a park was talked about, 1920s when the park was authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| once the two states came together and actually acquired enough land for the national park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| and in 1935 that occurred when over 400,000 acres was turned over to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| We have two goals for the 75th anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| One is to celebrate our collective heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| and it's not just the heritage of those individuals that you might have read about in the paper from East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| that did so much to create this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| but it's also the heritage of those families that actually were moved off their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| and displaced when this national park was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| But what a wonderful thing it did to the economy of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| and Western North Carolina once this park was established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| Secondly, we want to talk about our stewardship of this land for the next 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| It is a collective responsibility of all the citizens of both these states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| of which we have so much to thank for the creation of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| but at the same time we expect a lot in protecting the park for the next years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| That legacy of stewardship began in East Tennessee, Western North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| It continued with the Civilian Conservation Corps over eight years in the 1930s into 1940| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| when so much work was done in the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| and that legacy of stewardship continues today with the Great Smoky Mountains Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| the Friends of the Smokies, and over 2,000 park volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| So in my limited time I asked of two things of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| One is to say thank you to the citizens of East Tennessee, and in this case particularly Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| for the fact that this national park is here and it has become the most visited national park in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| The second, I want to invite each of the members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| and Mayor Mike Ragsdale to attend with us some special events this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| The first of those is on Friday, April 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| It is our intention to have both of the governors of Tennessee and North Carolina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| join together on top of the mountain near Clingman's Dome in a focus on the two states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| Because once again, even though it is a federal national park today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| it began because of the state's focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| and that state focus comes down to individual citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| So we are inviting each commission of each county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| each city council and mayors to join us on top of the mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| and we invite you to present a proclamation that we will keep as part of the archives of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| So Friday, April 24th at noon on Clingman's Dome is your first invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| The second is to take part in a weekend of activities, June 13th, 14th, and 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| where we will have celebrations surrounding the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| the closest of which to you will be in Cades Cove on June 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| when the Knoxville Symphony will play that afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| Third is the rededication of the park, and I know many of you have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| In fact, it again was in the paper on Sunday, the famous photograph of FDR dedicating the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| which occurred six years after its establishment in 1940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| And it is our goal, we are very hopeful and optimistic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| that we will be able to get the current president to join us to rededicate the park on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| The historic significance of that is that if we are able to get the president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| he will be the first president to be in the park since FDR in 1940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| All of that information will be handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| Kevin has with him copies of our park newspaper that not only identify those three events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| but over 100 community events that are going to be happening all summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| We want to say a special thank you to Mike Arms, who has been working with our 75th committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| and who hung the 75th banner today for each of you to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| We also have a website and some other information about the specific events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| So we thank you again for the citizens that helped make this park possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| We invite you to participate this summer, and we look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| Mr. Chairman, thank you for the invitation to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Our next presenter will be Dr. Jim McIntyre, Nassau School superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I'm glad to be here with you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4608)|
| 1:17:06| With your indulgence, Mr. Chairman, I know India Kincannon, our chair of our school board, is also here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| and may want to just make a brief remark before I begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4630)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Members of the commission, I've got good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| I'm going to be brief, and I'm not asking for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| I'm India Kincannon, chair of the Knox County Board of Education, 941 Eleanor Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| I just wanted to thank the commissioners who've been able to come to some of our school board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| and some of our joint meetings that KCA has hosted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I think those have been very fruitful, and I really appreciate your effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| And I just want to say on behalf of the board, we appreciate keeping the lines of communication open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| and we want to communicate as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| and we appreciate that it is a very difficult financial situation for the entire county this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| And Dr. McIntyre is going to take a few minutes of your time to present a little more details about our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| but we'll have more discussions later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| But I just want to say welcome to those of you who are newer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| Congratulations to Ms. Carringer, wherever she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4696)|

| 1:18:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I will be very brief as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Just recognizing that our appropriation for the Knox County Schools will come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| and be appropriated by this body, I thought it would be appropriate just to come over for a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| I spoke with many of you this weekend at the meeting that we had on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| but just, Mr. Chairman, with your indulgence, I have a handout that we'll pass around to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| and just walk you very briefly through a couple of the items that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| So we have in this package two memoranda and a summary sheet of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| We know it's very early on in the fiscal cycle for us to be talking about our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| and be making decisions about our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| but we also recognize that we need to be doing a lot of that because we have a staffing cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| where we want to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| We want to make sure that we're able to hire the best and brightest teachers that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| and we'd like to do that and make sure that our staffing is set before the end of the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| so that folks can plan for that and make sure that we have great teachers before our children when school begins in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| The first memoranda speaks to where we think our budget situation currently resides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| We are hopeful that we will come before this body at some point in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| and see an allocation of resources that is at least equal to where we are this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| We understand that there are revenue challenges out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| We understand that revenues are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| but we also are very hopeful that this body and the board will see fit to appropriate resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4801)|
| 1:20:10| that are at least at the level we're at this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| So we're looking at our budget right now and taking sort of what I call a three-prong approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| One is looking at our overall budget and the dynamics that we have that are system-wide dynamics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| Two is looking very carefully at our central office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| and what reductions and reallocations and efficiencies we can identify there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| And then third is looking at school-based allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| By our calculus at this point, based on some very preliminary assumptions and information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| we believe that even if we have a level-funded budget for the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| with our fixed costs and all of the other things that go into our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| we probably are looking at a gap of about $15 million to $16 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| between likely expenditures and likely revenues for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| So we've got some challenges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| We hope that we will work with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| but we also hope that we'll work with the commission and the mayor over the next several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| to narrow that gap and to come to a place where we have a balanced budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| that works for our schools and for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Just a word about the school-based allocations, because you may hear some about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| We are working to make the allocation of resources to our schools transparent, rational, and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4876)|
| 1:21:24| And so we have developed a formula, a school-based allocation methodology that supports that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| And its basic mechanisms are looking at the proportion of students in our schools that are low-income students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| and then applying for various thresholds of low-income concentrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| a ratio of teachers to students for those various levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| So we believe that that allows us to be very clear about what our allocation of resources is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| It also allows us to target some additional resources to where we believe the educational needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| and some of the social and other needs are going to be greatest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| So that information should be in the packet that you'll be receiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| and if you have questions along the way, please let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| But again, we're looking to make sure that we have a rational, equitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| and transparent distribution of resources to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| The final document that you will have in your packet is around our capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| And what we are looking to do is look at basically a short-term and long-term perspective on our capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4944)|
| 1:22:32| In the short term, we know that, well, let me say in the long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| we know we need to develop some additional capacity to be able to make good capital decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| about the future of the physical plants that we have in the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| and how we're going to use them and what additional work needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| to make sure that they are appropriate in inviting educational spaces for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| So we're going to continue to build some capacity, work with the Metropolitan Planning Council and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| to make sure that we have the data and the information that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| to make good recommendations on the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| In the short term, we obviously face some challenges in terms of the debt obligation that we have for capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| and the resources that we have available to really retire some of that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| We're looking at an increase of about $1.5 million this year alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| just to increase debt service for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| So that's a huge challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| And if we don't do much else over the next several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| we're seeing million-dollar-plus increases in our debt service due to our capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| So we're looking very carefully at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Our resources are very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| But in the short term, we feel like we need to do some continuing ongoing maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| what we call physical plant upgrades, and shoring up foundations, roofs, and HVAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| all of the stuff that's really not that exciting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| but really allows us to continue to make sure our buildings are great educational spaces for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| Over the longer term, we want to identify a series of priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| that we think are important to move forward on in the next several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| We also recognize that there may be some additional resources that may come to the fore in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| So we understand that the federal government is working on a stimulus package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| that may include school infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| We understand that the state is working on a green building fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| that hopefully at some point will get off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| So there may be some additional resources besides the local resources that may come to bear at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| and we want to be ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| So the memorandum that you'll have in your package will also outline my recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| to the Board of Education of what some of those priorities might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| And they include a southwest Knox County solution for elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| They include, if we're going to be funded for a green project, an environmentally friendly project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| a project at Bell Morris Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| They include looking at a magnet technology high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| You may remember when I offered a vision for the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| one of the things I thought we should explore when we talk about our magnet schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| is a magnet technology high school, a standalone, high-quality magnet technology high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| So that is one of the priorities I'm asking the Board to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| And also looking at one of our schools that we think needs some additional assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| in terms of the actual physical plant, which is Chilhowee Intermediate School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| When I talk to our facilities folks, that's one of the priority areas they identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| because it's one of the buildings that needs the most work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| And then finally, I am asking the Board to give some additional consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| to a project at the Carter Campus to work on perhaps a new gymnasium for the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| which would allow us to do some work at the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| connecting the elementary school to the existing middle school gym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| which would allow us to move administrative offices, free up some classroom space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| and work a little bit on the traffic pattern out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| So those are the priorities that I've identified for the Board and have asked them to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| And eventually, understanding that the appropriations come through your commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| I wanted to come before you today and just offer you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| And we'd be glad to talk with any of you if you have questions along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| or if you have questions at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| But I recognize our time is short today, so I just wanted to keep it very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Just very briefly, Dr. McIntyre, thank you so much for coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Having been on commission now for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| the relationship between this body and the school board has been strained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| and that's probably a kind word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| It has taken an economic crisis to get us to talking to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| and it's a good thing that we're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| not a good thing that we're having an economic crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| But I just want to applaud you for coming before us, giving us this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| We need to have several meetings between now and the start of the next budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| because we really need to talk and we really need to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| and understand one another's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| So, again, just thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| It's been long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| We're going to go to Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| honoring Robert Jackson Hughley, Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| If Mr. Hughley and the mayor would join me at the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5251)|
| 1:27:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Robert Jackson Hughley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5270)|
| 1:28:00| Whereas Robert Jackson Hughley, the youngest of four children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| was born in Columbia, Tennessee in 1955 to a band director, big band leader, and music shop owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5284)|

| 1:28:35| and 23-year-old Evan, who is in South College Radiography Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| and whereas Robert was born to music enthusiasts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5321)|

| 1:29:36| have also experienced much success in the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| and whereas Robert has helped to instill a positive attitude and sportsmanship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| in all who participate in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5385)|

| 1:29:52| The Knox County Commission hereby honors Robert Jackson Hughley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| for his commitment to the Bearden community and conveys their sincere thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5396)|

| 1:30:16| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| I would ask for a positive vote to honor Mr. Hughley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| It's almost in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| The clerk may have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Go ahead, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Our state has a very unique nickname, one that we're all very proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| We're volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| And Mr. Hughley represents the very best of that name and that spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| He contributes his time to helping young people learn a great sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| but at the same time, he teaches them about integrity and character and being honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| I've heard from numerous parents about his volunteer efforts, and I think it's very wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| applaud you honoring him here today. So, Mr. Chairman, we have a lot of outstanding people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| who volunteer in our community and certainly Mr. Hughley is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| Ladies and gentlemen, I'm honored. My daughter, Hannah, and my fiancé, Marlene, and my good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5471)|
| 1:31:25| friend, David Webb, have done a tremendous amount of helping me do this league in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| last 15 years, and there's a lot of good community feel, and thank you for honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5491)|
| 1:31:38| all of our volunteers. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| Mr. Hughley, I need your address for the record. I need your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| My address is 805 Eagle Den Drive, Seymour, Tennessee, 37865.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| Thank you. 803. And then we're going back to picking our judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5514)|
| 1:32:07| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, to receive a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| from the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board regarding the status of its defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| benefit plans, Resolution 803. I'm going to let our chairman of our pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5535)|
| 1:32:38| board announce what's going to take place, Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| We have Bob Cross here with USI Consulting Group to sort of give us just an update, more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| or less an update on our pension. I need your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5570)|
| 1:33:00| Bob Cross, President of Southeast USI Consulting Group, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 1796, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5580)|
| 1:33:20| I believe you have in front of you, I believe everyone's received a copy of this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| Just a couple of reminders. As everyone knows, 2008, extremely difficult year financially in a lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5607)|
| 1:33:39| Just a few of these statistics, the S&P 500 was down 38.5 percent, worst performance since 1931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| The Dow Jones was off 33.8 again, the worst performance since 1931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5627)|
| 1:33:55| And then the very last bullet I think is the most telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| During the 2008 year, worldwide there was $17 trillion lost in various share values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5638)|
| 1:34:09| So again, we all know these are statistics that indicate just how rough 2008 has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5649)|
| 1:34:18| This has naturally had an impact on all retirement systems, not just those of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5658)|
| 1:34:26| Just a little bit of background, just a couple of notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| All three of the defined benefit plans sponsored by Knox County are actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5671)|
| 1:34:39| So the purpose of our being here today, ordinarily when the actual evaluation is prepared, that's in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| So we come to the Commission through the Retirement Board to make a recommendation as to deposit amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| Ms. Kim Bennett and I, Kim is the Director for the Knox County Retirement Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| in November discussed that that would not work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| In view of the significant financial difficulties in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| we needed to come to the Commission with an estimate, I'm going to stress that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| an estimate of probable contribution amounts for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5714)|
| 1:35:22| So the purpose of the meeting today or this presentation is to outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| or present possible a range of contribution amounts for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| If we go to the Knox County Retirement Plan, that's a closed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| And again, just a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| The county sponsors three defined benefit plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| Two of those plans are closed, which means there are no new active participants entering those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| We have one open plan, which again means that new participants are coming into that plan as they are hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| So the first plan we'll go through is the Knox County closed, again closed defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| Contribution amount is increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| We've recommended a range of about $4.5 to $5.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| That's the contribution range which we would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| That would have to be the contribution that would have to be made, again, for the fiscal year coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| Keep in mind that with respect to a closed plan, we have to deal not only with the actuarial component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| but also with the financial component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| This plan consists primarily of retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| There's a significant cash flow going out of the plan as a result thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| And when you look at a drop of $79 million from $79 million in assets to $51 million in assets over the course of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5804)|
| 1:36:53| then not only do we, again, have to recognize the actuarial component but the financial component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| So as a result of that, again, we think that the contribution range for that plan for this year will be $4.5 to $5.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5819)|
| 1:37:07| Mr. Chairman, can we ask questions as he's going, as he's sitting, or do you want to wait until the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| I think we need to wait until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| If we now go to the Board of Education plan, again, this is a closed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| We only have about 80 to 100, less than 100, active participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| We estimate and project that the contribution to that plan for the fiscal year beginning 7-1-09| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| will be $2 million to $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| And I might add that we're hopeful that the contribution amount will fall at the lower end of that range once the valuation is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5858)|
| 1:37:49| As far as the UOP, the Uniformed Officers' Pension Plan, that is an open plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| And, again, we can see the contribution last year, $2.8, and we project this year the range will be $4.5 to $5.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5875)|
| 1:38:06| And then if we look at the total, the contribution amount last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| and by that year we mean the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007, ending June 30, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5891)|
| 1:38:19| the county's contribution is about $3.1 million, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| We estimate that the contribution for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009, will be $11 million to $13.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| But, again, we're optimistic and I believe that it will fall within the lower end of that particular range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| Based upon the fact that we did have a positive December, I know it's still a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| So we're looking at an increment in the county's funding requirement for the year of approximately $8 to $10.7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5925)|
| 1:38:55| but optimistic it will fall at the lower end of that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Back to your closed plans that you have, if you can go back to those charts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| how many people are in the closed plan and what's the average age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| Do you have a stat on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| With respect to the county plan, most of the individuals are retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| The number of actives, 200 to 230 average age is certainly 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5957)|
| 1:39:27| Yeah, 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| So we're still going to be in that for a long time then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Well, these people retire most certainly within the next ten years and some earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| But to your point, and I think that's a-we do-given the nature of the closed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5976)|
| 1:39:43| we're hopeful and I would believe that we're close to the peak as far as contribution amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| and those will decline over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Mr. Cross, the uniformed officers pension plan voted on, approved by the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=5996)|
| 1:40:06| I've had some calls, had some e-mails, suggestions that maybe this is something that we shouldn't do anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| Maybe we should close this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| I don't believe we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| We cannot take away this pension plan from those officers that are in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Not an attorney, but it's my understanding that the way the laws-two aspects of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| One, it's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| So I-and I might want to speak to Mr. Bill Mason or ask Mr. Mason to speak in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| As it's in the charter, I believe that it would require a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| The second, there are various Tennessee judicial rulings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| which to us clearly indicate that once a person is vested and has been promised a formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| that formula could not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| So two components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| I think individuals who are in that plan, that benefit could not be taken away or changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| at least that are vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| As far as new hires, I think would require a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| So the only way to-the only option that-for this current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6066)|
| 1:41:14| we could only change it to where with a vote of the people would be to-new hires could not go under the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| if the people of Knox County voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| That would be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| So we can't do away with the plan for the current-for those that are currently in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Is there anybody else here that could speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| Mr. Lockett or Bill, do you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| Mr. Mason is the expert, but if they're vested, it's my understanding, Mr. Mason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| those who are currently in the plan and are vested in the plan, they cannot be-those vested rights cannot be taken away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6103)|
| 1:41:54| My name is William Mason, 313 North Forest Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| That's the law in Tennessee for a defined benefit plan such as the uniformed officer plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| That was what I thought, but I just wanted to hear from you all as to making sure I was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6127)|
| 1:42:15| Second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Right now we're way below what we need to, Mr. Cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| and you've indicated somewhere between $11 to $13 or so million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| But that only catches us up somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| That doesn't bring us all the way up to 100% of what we need in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| when we take a look at our liabilities versus what our assets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| What are the regulations that we have to have this year in order to-you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6163)|
| 1:42:51| what level of funding do we have to be at this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| What percentage or is there one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| As you're a public plan, the way the pension plans are written, that funding is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6177)|
| 1:43:04| The plans have to be actuarially funded and they also have to be financially funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| So an actuary certifies the contribution amount required to keep a plan financially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6190)|
| 1:43:18| So we've assumed a 7.5% rate of return over a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| and over time we would hope and expect, given the asset mix, that we would realize that rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| So we expect long term to meet the actuarial goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| This year, I mean, we're obviously not going to be at 100% even with the $11 to $13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6215)|
| 1:43:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| What percentage do you think we'll be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| I mean, what does that get us to, 70%, 75%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| Bear with me on this one a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| The plans are valued as far as the funded ratio on two bases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| One of those is cash, market value, and the second's on an actuarial value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| From an actuarial perspective, you're going to be, we would estimate, easily 80% to 85% funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6245)|
| 1:44:13| at the end of the valuation date, which is 12-31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| On a strictly market value basis, it's going to be somewhat less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| But again, we take into account the funded status of the plan in terms of the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| that we make to the retirement board to meet its financial obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| So with respect particularly to both closed plans, we have to take into account the cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| We've got to remember we have $6 to $7 million flowing out of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| We've got a market value drop from $97 to $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| So just from the standpoint of being responsible, which I know this commission is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| I know the retirement board is, we need to make contributions sufficient to maintain at least status quo, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| from a financial perspective as well as actuarially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| My last question, if the actuary, and I guess you're the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| If you come to us and say, in order to meet what the charter says, to be actuarially sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6311)|
| 1:45:20| and you put a price tag on that, can Knox County deviate from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| In other words, if you say $10 million, $11 million, $12 million, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| is that mandatory upon this commission to include that in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| We certify a deposit amount to the retirement board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| They deliver that to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| And based upon our reading of the document and our understanding of it, that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| So before we decide to hire the first teacher, before we decide to hire a construction worker to do a project for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6345)|
| 1:45:56| we have to pay all our obligations, and this would be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| That would be my understanding with respect to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Mr. Law Director, is that your assumption as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| It is with the proviso that the funding is actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6367)|
| 1:46:16| I believe that's been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| That's an issue as to what is and what is not actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| So after they tell us how much it is, it's not a matter of whether or not we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| It's a matter that we have to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| Bob, you answered some of my questions when you answered Commissioner Blutho's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6400)|
| 1:46:47| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| I'm looking at previous market swoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| Ten years back we had the tech bubble burst, and, you know, many tech funds would have lost 60 to 70 plus percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6412)|
| 1:47:00| I wish hopefully pension funds wouldn't be that tech heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| And are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| The October 87 crash, we lost, what, over 30% in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| I'm trying to be optimistic, thinking that, you know, American economy and capitalism will recover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| I know it's a global economy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| Don't you traditionally, I'm not going to pin you down on this, but give me an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| Are you going to say we're 11 million short and we need to do that by June 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| I know the market will do something in the meantime, probably, besides tread water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| Hopefully it will trend upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| But won't you be, don't you give us a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| Don't you say we think this, to be actuary sound, you need 11 million or 15 million or 8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| And in a perfect world, put it in right now, but we suggest you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| And don't we have a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| I guess I'm trying to see if I can spread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| We can spread this over a couple of budget years, the hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| Unfortunately not in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| This is for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| Now, I suppose if there were funds available for this fiscal year, for example, the one ending 6-30-2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6489)|
| 1:48:17| for some reason that that's possible that that could be used to balance between 08 and 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| But certainly these deposits would be no, would have to be made no later than fiscal year July 1, 09 through 6-30-2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6503)|
| 1:48:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| So you will, what, looking at some of the jurisdictions in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| I remember the debacle San Diego went through in their pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| What happens if the jurisdiction says, well, we don't have the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| You just say your pensions are not actuary sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| And then do you walk away or are there other consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| I'm not suggesting that happened, but what's the other side of the coin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| That's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| I think generally some of those systems would not have the language of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| that the Knox County pension system would see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| Most of the systems in Tennessee, at least the ones with which we work and are responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| have language to the effect that the plan has to be actuary funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| The Knox County pension system has had that provision going back for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| You go to some large cities in the northeast or in California, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| a few in Florida, some state systems, there's really no stipulation as to funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6566)|
| 1:49:33| And unfortunately, some of those systems were 60% funded prior to this downturn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| and they're down to 40% or worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| I cannot imagine without some type of bailout that they're ever going to get to where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| So even though the counties, these plans are where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| we're still very fortunate that they've been managed responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| And it would be our interpretation that these deposits would need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| as the pension plan documents stipulate that those requirements have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| I guess my last one is I won't drag you in the political debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| but the $0.08 would have been, in hindsight, if we had done the $0.08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| we probably would have been in much better financial shape, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| We would have had two years, if a penny on the tax rate is $800,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| that's six to six and a half would be going into the third year of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| Had we had an additional six and a half million per year since the inception of the uniform pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| it would probably be pretty sound, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Well, I don't want to, in your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| I respect the political process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Well, I think, you know, and again, it's hindsight, but maybe that would have put us on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| And I respect the people who represented me who made those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| And I sort of wish we had that option again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6666)|
| 1:51:07| Commissioner, you do have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| You do have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Let's make no mistake, the plan has been sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| And let's don't make any mistake about this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| This is not unique to Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| You're in a situation that's not unique just to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| You're in a situation where you look across the country, any plan, and most of them do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| that had money invested in the stock market are experiencing similar things that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| Our plan was just better managed than most, as Mr. Cross had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| We're going to be addressing the pension plan as we get to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| And we'll address it in a manner which is prescribed by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| But I think right now, to begin to press any panic buttons, let's see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| You saw a form that or chart that was up on the board that showed what had happened in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| with the stock markets dropped dramatically in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| It's also rebounded dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| Americans don't just press panic buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| We let things go and we build our economy back, and we're going to do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| Plan on the table, stimulus package, which I think could really help us in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| turn things around pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| So when we get to the point where we're addressing the budget, we're going to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| We're going to address it in a responsible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| We're going to meet the needs that are out there very creatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| But if you had raised taxes back then, you'd only fund the plan to the level you need to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| You wouldn't have overfunded the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| So I'm not sure that money would have been there even if you had raised taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| But one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| Before you even consider that thought, I want you to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| You don't have to go very far to find one of our friends and neighbors who are unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| Many of them, there are no severance packages available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| So what we need to focus our attention on, in my opinion, is how do we get our local economy going again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| We're visiting with our city officials, with the Chamber of Commerce and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| We're about creating more jobs and turning it around, not that the sky is falling and let's raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| So I'm not suggesting any of you are pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| But know very well it's our responsibility to try and do everything we can to return these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| There was one week that went by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| I think we had 2,000 of our friends and neighbors lose their job in one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| Now, I don't think they can hardly afford their house payment, much less an increased property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| or any other type of tax right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| So we're going to have to be very creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| We're going to have to look at ways we do things differently than we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| And we're going to do that, and we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| But I don't think we can tax our way out of the current situation that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| So I wanted to respond to that because we've managed this plan properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| We had a dramatic downturn in the stock market that everybody in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| probably has been impacted in some way, shape, form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Let's see if we can't turn things around and make it better and let's do it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Commissioner Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| Yeah, I'd like to go last if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Yes, I think I addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| I think it was Mr. Cross that was up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| There's a lot of terms that have been thrown around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| and I just want to be sure that I understand these as I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| And just as an example, I'm going to refer to the Uniformed Officers Pension Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6843)|
| 1:54:08| And one of those deals a little bit with what Commissioner Leuthold said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| is that the assets of that plan right now are $69,668,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6853)|
| 1:54:22| and the accrued liability today is around $115,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| And last year it was $104,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| So what's happened is that the liability that the county has in the plan increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| I believe that's about $12.5 million this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| That means that the stock market would have performed, you know, right at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| if it hadn't been a bad year, we still picked up an additional $12.5 million liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| And then the other thing is if you look at the present value of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6896)|
| 1:55:04| and the accrued liability, we're off about $45 million from where we should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6904)|
| 1:55:16| That's $115,000 minus the $69,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6916)|
| 1:55:26| I guess that would be what you would refer to as fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| In response, just to make sure the questions were all there, with these types of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6931)|
| 1:55:40| because it's an open plan, we project the liabilities over 40, 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| So we use an asset smoothing technique so we don't recognize all the losses in a particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| We don't recognize all the gains in a particular year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| In this case, we smooth those gains over a period of time, five years in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| That's a very accepted actuarial technique, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| because if we do not smooth the gains and losses, we're going to have a yo-yo impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| And, again, private industry uses the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| For example, the city of Knoxville uses a 10-year smoothing technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| They use an 8% investment assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| And beyond that, their plan is almost identical to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| Their contribution amount for the coming year is about 17% of payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| The contribution amount for this plan for the upcoming year is going to be about 17% of payroll, we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| So even with this significant loss in the plan for the ongoing year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=6999)|
| 1:56:47| so, again, it speaks to the fact that even with these losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| the plan deposited percentage of pay would probably have been 12% to 13% of pay for this plan for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7011)|
| 1:56:59| But, unfortunately, with these losses, it's going to go up to about 17% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7019)|
| 1:57:06| But we do smooth the gains and losses out over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| I guess the other question I have refers to the definition of a closed plan that Commissioner Luthol was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7030)|
| 1:57:18| and I want to make it clear in my mind and maybe some other people's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| The plan can be closed, my understanding is, by putting it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| It can only be closed by putting it back on the referendum since this is part of our county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| Again, I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| I defer to counsel, but that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| But even if the plan is closed, those officers that are vested in the plan are still involved in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7058)|
| 1:57:46| and you mentioned this earlier, it is just closed to new employees that come to work for the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| And the one thing that would happen with that is we would maybe put a lid on some of this liability that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7075)|
| 1:58:06| I think that my understanding was that back in January 1, 2007, when the plan came forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| and when it was on the ballot, we thought that the $0.08 tax increase that was proposed would take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| but that would have been a shortfall anyway because I think that would only have raised a little over $6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| maybe $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| But, indeed, by this time the liability is $12.5 million, but that's really independent of the stock market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7106)|
| 1:58:33| That really has nothing to do with how the stock market does with the increased liabilities in this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7113)|
| 1:58:39| With an open plan, you have to have asset gain along with the liability gain to make the equation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| Bottom line, you're saying that we will need approximately $8 to $10.7 million to make this actuarially sound in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7133)|
| 1:59:02| Is that what I'm getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Now, when will you give us a number, a firm number, because that's kind of a two, $3 million spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| Will that be in the budget that the mayor presents to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| How will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| We expect to receive data from the pension board office within the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| It will take us approximately four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| We will deliver the evaluation report for all three plans to the retirement board meeting in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7163)|
| 1:59:30| And those figures will be available certainly no later than the retirement board meeting on that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| You have here that the total is $11 to $13.7, but you say that the funding amount is in the range of $8 to $11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7175)|
| 1:59:42| When you say actuarially sound, are you saying that we don't need to do 100 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| What percentage do you think we need to do to make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| At the time we prepared these figures, we used asset values as of 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| We were not sure what would happen in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| It could have been even worse, fortunately, for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| December was a more positive month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| So we would expect, based on the preliminary work that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| that the deposit amount is going to fall in the lower end of that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| So we would expect that the incremental value will be close to, say, $8 to $8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| So the idea of the $10 and $11, you don't think it's going to be that high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| You think it's going to be around $8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| $8 to $8.5, if I could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| In the funding of this, you have talked to us about how the market affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| You say you're smoothing it out over time in your formula, yet you use the 7.5 percent flat rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| It sounds like a straight line growth rate, whether the market fell or whether the market went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| Am I missing something in your explanation here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| We assume 7.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| And, again, that's a 30- to 40-year projection of assumed rates returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| We know that in some years we're going to earn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Typically, when you see a downturn such as this, the market rebounds 20 to 40 percent within the next eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| So we're not going to recognize all of that gain at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| So we're not going to have all of that to use, just like we would not have all of the loss to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| But we do expect 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| Now, the city uses 8 percent, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| The state of Tennessee uses 7.5 as well, so by way of comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| But in your estimate, you've just said the market usually rebounds anywhere 10, 15, 20 percent after a downturn like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| And we're using 7.5 as a normal standard growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| Have you calculated any potential rebound into this $8 million or $10 million shortfall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| or are we just assuming that there's zero rebound going to be this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| The way that works is through the smoothing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| So, again, if we were to recognize all of this loss in one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| then we'd have a significant increase in contribution amount over and above this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| Just like if we recognized all the gain, we think we'd have an unrealistic view of where the plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7326)|
| 2:02:14| And so sometimes there's a push for benefit improvements when, again, that would be unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| So we try, with the smoothing process, again, to take into account the gains and losses on a reasonable basis over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7339)|
| 2:02:26| So your 7.5 consideration is your smoothing factor, regardless of what happens to the market, how bad it goes or how good it goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7346)|
| 2:02:33| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| I will say that from a financial perspective, and this is we have two closed plans, the Board of Education plan and the county plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7354)|
| 2:02:43| And if one looks at the county's plan, the benefit payments are over $7 million a year that's coming out of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7363)|
| 2:02:53| The Board of Education, it's over $5 million a year coming out of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| So certainly from a financial perspective, with a closed plan, one has to also manage that component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| And that's part of the reason why we're recommending these increases in contribution amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| So with a closed plan, you're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| You've got to take into account the financial component along with the actuarial component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| One last thing, and I'll turn it back to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| In this particular plan with the sheriff's pension plan that's voted on by the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7402)|
| 2:03:30| we are legally obligated to those that are currently vested in the plan, not currently in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7410)|
| 2:03:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Those individuals who are currently in the plan and those individuals who are vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7419)|
| 2:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| If the community said, we don't want to do this anymore, say today, in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7429)|
| 2:03:56| we would be liable for only those people who are currently vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| and those people who are not currently vested in the plan, it would reduce these liability numbers substantially, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| I want to make these liability amounts are for those people who are currently in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| So this liability is going to exist going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| It's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| So we could not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Now, I would want to make Bill Mason, since it's in the charter, could we, even those individuals who are non-vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7465)|
| 2:04:37| I know that's applicable for state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| I'm sorry to put you on the spot here, but I just want to make absolutely sure we answer accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| Bill, I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| William Mason, 313 North Forest Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7486)|
| 2:04:53| The pension provisions on the officer's plan in the charter would have to be amended as well as comply with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7493)|
| 2:05:05| I think the commissioner's question is addressed by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| which would say that every officer who has a vested and accrued benefit at the point in time in which the amendment was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7511)|
| 2:05:22| would be entitled to remain in the plan with a current set of benefits for his or her career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7522)|
| 2:05:32| When we're talking about vesting, we're talking about there is a minimum number of years to become vested in a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7532)|
| 2:05:41| versus I'm in the plan immediately vested versus maybe five years in the plan you're vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| Is it an immediate vesting when you're hired in this plan, or do we have some future vesting date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7547)|
| 2:05:53| Under Section 705B of the charter, the vesting schedule for this plan is five years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7553)|
| 2:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| The people who currently are not vested in this plan, if, say, next year the voters decided to close this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7564)|
| 2:06:12| that would reduce our liability substantially by taking the non-vested people into another type plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| or would we still be totally liable for what we're liable for today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| Let me let Bob address that, but also to say if you terminate a plan, you would normally vest the people in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7583)|
| 2:06:37| And so the question the commissioner is raising about non-vested people needs some study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7597)|
| 2:06:46| I wouldn't want to just take that on the hop this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Commissioner Leuven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| I just wanted to sort of clear up maybe a little bit about the eight cent, because there seem to be some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| especially from maybe some of the commissioners that weren't on the commission at the time that was voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7621)|
| 2:07:07| The eight cent impact that was part of the ballot question was derived from a set of assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7627)|
| 2:07:14| One of the assumptions was the 7.5% rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| The other part of the assumption was the amortizing the $57 million that the county was going to have to put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7638)|
| 2:07:27| It was an unfunded liability at the time, and we assumed we were going to amortize that over a 30-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7647)|
| 2:07:35| It ended up we bonded the $57 million, and that means we're paying it back over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7655)|
| 2:07:43| So just like you're paying off a mortgage on your house over a 30-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| if you went and got a 20-year note, you would pay that back a little quicker, so it costs a little more each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7668)|
| 2:07:54| You end up saving some money over time and interest, but it does cost a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| So the eight cents wasn't necessarily going to go all of it into the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7679)|
| 2:08:09| It was to pay for the liability, and it was also to pay for because this plan, not only after you caught up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7689)|
| 2:08:18| because the $57 million was to catch up prior years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7698)|
| 2:08:25| but the cost component going forward with the plan was more expensive than the plan that the officers were in at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7705)|
| 2:08:34| So that's just a little history of what that eight cents paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7719)|
| 2:08:48| What would you say the impact is as of today of this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| It would be a bit more than that eight cents, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| It would be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| Not even counting the big loss we're going to have to put money in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7738)|
| 2:09:07| Last year, we looked at it, it was closer to a ten cent impact on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7752)|
| 2:09:13| And just for anybody who wasn't here at the time, the $57 million bond, that was an amount borrowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7753)|
| 2:09:19| so we could have fixed payments and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| And deposited the full amount of the proceeds of that bond was deposited into the retirement and pension board account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7763)|
| 2:09:29| Yes, and I believe at the time all the deputies that decided to become part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| they had to turn over every bit of what they had in their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| and I think all total that came up to about $39 or so million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| It was well over $30 million, yes, close to $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| So these officers have contributed quite a bit as well towards this plan already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7789)|
| 2:09:58| Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| First I'd like to ask, are we through with Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| No, Sheriff Jones and then you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| I just wanted to thank Bob Cross for the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| I think he did an excellent job and he handled the questions real well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| and I know he's optimistic that their market's going to come back, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| I hope he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| Jimmy Jones, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| Very rarely will I ever come to you with a prepared statement, so bear with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| but I feel that this issue is so important that I want to be sure that I'm not misquoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7836)|
| 2:10:42| Since the inception of the uniformed officer's pension plan, myths, lies, and half-truths have run rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7842)|
| 2:10:49| It's time to set the record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Let's talk about those myths, lies, and half-truths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| Number one, the sheriff's office devised the pension plan solely for its own benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7854)|
| 2:11:00| False.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| The Fraternal Order of Police initiated and campaigned for the sheriff's pension plan for one reason and one reason only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| to provide sheriff's officers an equal retirement to their counterparts at the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| If you think sheriff's officers do not deserve equality, we respect your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| Number two, there were no contributions from sheriff's officers, only taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| False.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7885)|
| 2:11:26| Knox County sheriff's officers contributed approximately $40 million up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| plus 6% of their salary yearly, or about $1.5 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7892)|
| 2:11:38| Number three, Knox County sheriff's officers will receive pensions in the range of $60,000 to $80,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7898)|
| 2:11:46| False.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| The average...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| Hello, Herb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| The average retirement for a Knox County officer after 30 years of service will be approximately $32,000 to $34,000 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7914)|
| 2:12:03| and they are responsible for paying their own health insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| Number four, the biggest lie of all occurred on Wednesday, January 29, 2009, in the local section of the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7927)|
| 2:12:17| The byline of an article written by Rebecca Farrar reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Sheriff's Office Seeks Property Tax Boost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| Let me make this perfectly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| Neither I nor any member of the Knox County Sheriff's Office has ever asked for a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7948)|
| 2:12:36| This blatant lie was used to infuriate the taxpayers of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| If I had come to commission and asked for a property tax increase without a public vetting, i.e. a Knox County election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7961)|
| 2:12:49| as a taxpayer, I would have been furious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| But that's not what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| An election was held with a charter amendment on the ballot, clearly defined by Commissioner Luthold's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7975)|
| 2:13:02| Some say it was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| I say that's an excuse used by those who were against the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| The taxpayers of Knox County voted for the officer's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| As stated in the News Sentinel, it passed by a narrow majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| In America, the majority rules, and a victory by one vote is as good as a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| Many elections have been won by narrow margins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| Now let's get to the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| The mayor's administration decided not to seek an 8% property tax, as stated in the referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| but instead to borrow $57 million in bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| Now our pension, as everyone else's pension in Knox County, needs an infusion of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| We propose to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| First, we will ask for no salary increases in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| Second, we are currently working on a plan, which will be presented to our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| asking them to contribute an extra 4%, on top of the 6% they contribute yearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| to help shore up our pension plan until such time that the economy rebounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| I feel confident, as always, the men and women of the Knox County Sheriff's Office will step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| and help in tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| Last but not least, we should hold the media accountable for what they print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| They should print facts, not myths, lies, and half-truths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| Wow, look at the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Commissioner Smith, your light was already on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Did you have a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| Could I ask a question of the sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| These questions are for Sheriff J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8081)|
| 2:14:42| Sheriff, have you had an opportunity to look at that extra 4% and what type of funding we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| if, indeed, the employees decide they want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| The rough numbers are about, we contribute about $1.5 million now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| That extra 4% would be somewhere in the range of $1.1 to $1.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| which would make the total contribution of about $2.6, $2.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| You had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| I think you just simply misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| Sheriff, you said $0.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| You said 8% instead of $0.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| I'm sorry, $0.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Yeah, I just want to make sure that people understand it was an $0.08 property tax impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8114)|
| 2:15:21| It wasn't that it was mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| It was going to have to be either absorbed or somehow taken care of within the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8123)|
| 2:15:31| So I just wanted to take care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| And just so that everybody knows, them volunteering, if that's what they do, their 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8133)|
| 2:15:42| they're not required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| I believe that the referendum had in there that they would continue to only contribute 6% of their salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8144)|
| 2:15:55| So they're not required to pay any more than what they're currently doing, which is that 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| So I think that would be very helpful and should be commended if that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8161)|
| 2:16:08| And I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| On that amendment, on the ballot, was it $0.08 to $0.15 possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8173)|
| 2:16:18| No, it was simply, I believe it was just an $0.08 impact on the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8178)|
| 2:16:26| I looked at it this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| It was an $0.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8188)|
| 2:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| Commissioner Harmon, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| I have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| I got my computer back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8200)|
| 2:16:41| And this is not for the sheriff, but I guess, Mr. Cross, you said you're looking at around $0.08 to $0.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| If, indeed, the sheriff's employees decide to put in another $1.1, then that takes us down to maybe $7.5 or $7.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| So we're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| So if you come to us and say we need $8.5, the sheriff's employees come back and say, hey, we're going to contribute $1.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| then we're down to $7 something or other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| That would be applicable to the uniformed officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| I'm sorry I didn't touch on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| I'm sorry I didn't touch on these earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| For Bob, again, let me just comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| The $7.5 is a pretty good number, I think, if you look back 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8243)|
| 2:17:28| What are we equity buying, 50-50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| There's 50% equity, 10% real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| So 50-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| I mean, the $7.5 is a realistic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8258)|
| 2:17:39| You look it back with the Dow Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8259)|
| 2:17:40| 60 equity, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| It's done in the last 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| Let me briefly, the numbers here, the education, the closed pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| I see there's a gap of a million or two between present value and future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8270)|
| 2:17:58| and accrued liability and future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| But the uniforms is a huge number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| The top line is a gap of about 12, 12.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8284)|
| 2:18:10| that being the present value of future benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| And then the accrued liability is a gap of about 10.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| And my question would just be, as Dr. Bridge pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| this is irrelevant to what the stock market does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| If it does great or does lousy, these numbers continue to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| Are we looking at these numbers increasing every year into perpetuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8305)|
| 2:18:31| or until this pension goes away 100 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| These are great questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| As a practical matter, as individuals get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| ultimately the goal for any type of funding process, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| is to have the money at the time of retirement for every person that's eligible to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| does retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| So at some point this will peak for the existing population, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| existing population, and will peak and then start to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| But as you add new people to the system, to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| then you're going to have incremental liability at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| So the next many years will probably be a $10 million to $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| We need to expect to have that cost on our balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| It's going to depend on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| It depends on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| So I think if I could, it will increase in value for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| I couldn't actually give you a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| Just to make sure I'm accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| It's going to be with us for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| I have a question for Mr. Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| What Bud Armstrong was asking you, again, just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| somebody's into the plan and you say five years to get vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| but they're into it for three years and the voters decide they want to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| then you didn't get to finish answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| They're not vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| I mean, they don't lose their money, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| Mr. Mason's point, and it's ordinarily when you terminate a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| the individuals who are in the plan at that point in time become automatically vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| So I think what we'd like to do, if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| is do a little more research on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| Clearly new hires going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| if the voters were to decide to stop the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| then it could be applicable, would be applicable to new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| As far as existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| it's clear that anyone that's vested would be entitled to the existing formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| The ones that have been hired or hired up to the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| if Bill and I could do a little research on that one and get back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| just to make absolutely sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| Mr. Chairman, I just want to make one quick clarification, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| to the commissioners and the people in the audience, people watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| You'll see Commissioner Wright and I are trying to help our new Commissioner Carringer here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| help her get adjusted to the computer and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| We'll not be telling her how to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| She was at all the meetings and she can vote for herself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| but I just want to let you know that you will see conversation, but it's above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| Can I make one more clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| I want to make sure that people understand, watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| that this $10 million to $12 million shortfall is for all the pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| and not just for the uniformed officer's pension plan, for all three plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| I'd like to make one point real clear, especially for the sheriff and the people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| The question was not to promote the disappearance of the sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| I just wanted to understand how the money worked and how it's funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| so we can see what we're facing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| Herbert Monsier, 775 Bank of America Center in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8503)|
| 2:21:49| There are two pending cases in Chantry Court concerning this pension plan that I do not mean to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8509)|
| 2:21:56| As an advocate, let me suggest to you that this question of vesting is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8516)|
| 2:22:03| And I heard Mr. Cross on TV and ran out of my office to come down here to bring to your attention that I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8523)|
| 2:22:11| I believe that the vesting in the new plan has to go through the vesting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| to where all of those officers who are part of the old plan are vested in their old plan benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8537)|
| 2:22:25| but these new plan benefits are not contributed benefits, they're new money, they're taxpayer monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| And so it is my opinion that an officer has to vest in the new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| and the only persons who are vested in the new plan would be those who have retired under that plan, such as Sheriff Hutchinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8558)|
| 2:22:47| If my lawsuit isn't correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| So Sheriff Hutchinson and those people who have retired under the new pension plan, they are vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8569)|
| 2:22:58| Otherwise, the vesting is a very open question that I suggest that Mr. Lockett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| and these fine experts with my cautious eye looking as an advocate over their shoulder, that needs to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8584)|
| 2:23:13| It might need to be resolved by declaratory judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| Secondly, I disagree with Mr. Cross and Mr. Mason when they say that this plan has to be actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8596)|
| 2:23:25| The charter amendment, of which nobody listened to me at the time, says it does not have to be actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8605)|
| 2:23:33| So when the people voted on this, I'm sure they didn't know what they were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| but right in the uniform officer pension charter provision says that it doesn't have to be actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8617)|
| 2:23:46| So it's different from the other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| You can, as you go along and it meets its obligations, fund them as it goes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| As crazy as that sounds, but today's times are not like times a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8638)|
| 2:24:04| And so waiting and seeing, as one of you suggested, is a very, very viable possibility under this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8644)|
| 2:24:14| Now, my colleagues who have spoken to you, each time they spoke, they used under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8654)|
| 2:24:22| And I understand what they're saying under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| We are not a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| We are a Knox County charter government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| And we have a charter provision that we have adopted that I suggest to you says this does not have to be actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8676)|
| 2:24:46| Do I agree with that as a practical matter? Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| It was crazy when it was stuck in there, and it's crazy now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| However, I didn't anticipate that we were going to go south on our economy either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| I didn't anticipate that the 18 of you all, if I'm using my five minutes, Chairman, tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| I didn't anticipate that we were going to be potentially bankrupt in Knox County when this was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8708)|
| 2:25:14| Nobody did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| But that's exactly why you don't do what Knox County did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8716)|
| 2:25:24| Somebody made a decision to go out and borrow $100 million to try to make this actuarially sound when it didn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8724)|
| 2:25:34| Somebody decided that we're going to borrow $100 million of Knox County money at whatever the interest rate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| and then we're going to turn around and invest it in the stock market of the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| Looking in hindsight, folks, that was a dumb move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| It was a dumb move with the people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| And I came out of my office to come down and speak to you and tell you folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| don't just blindly listen to these people that have advised you in the past, because we're about to go bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8761)|
| 2:26:12| And I don't know how else to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| Sure, we're no different than anybody else in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| and that's because we've all been fat in America, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| We've all been used to those stock market returns coming in, hadn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| We've all just thought everything was going to be rosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| It ain't rosy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| It ain't pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| And an actuarially sound uniform pension retirement fund is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8797)|
| 2:26:45| Pay as you go until the people have an opportunity to look at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8805)|
| 2:26:56| Question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| Well, I guess just a response, you know, because I'm not familiar with the language in that charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8824)|
| 2:27:13| So I guess I'm assuming it's to our law director as to whether that language is in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8833)|
| 2:27:20| And I guess also if you or Mr. Cross could speak to the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| I know we've had several things that we've had to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| The state says this, but we have, you know, we're under a different rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| so we do or do not have to comply with what the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| So if you could speak to those two issues, I'd greatly appreciate it for my edification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| In terms of the charter provision itself, whether or not when it was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| it had language that said it was not required that it be actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| Again, that was adopted and voted on before I became law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| I do have asked the chief deputy to pull that, and we'll have it before this meeting expires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8879)|
| 2:28:05| In terms of state law, however, that does require that pensions be actuarially sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8885)|
| 2:28:12| I disagree with Mr. Moncier's statement that we can ignore state law in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8892)|
| 2:28:21| Even if, and we'll wait and see if there is language that says that it is not required that it be actuarially sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8901)|
| 2:28:32| what I understand Mr. Moncier suggesting is that we pay as we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| and that seems to be the consensus of what everyone else has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| So notwithstanding the fact that there was language, if it is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| that says that it does not have to be actuarially sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| everything that I have heard today is to the effect that it is the intention of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8932)|
| 2:29:00| You're just trying to get what numbers will require funding for it to be actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8940)|
| 2:29:09| Well, my position, sir, is that pay as you go until the people can look as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8949)|
| 2:29:17| or not we can afford to continue this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| The second question as to who is vested and who is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| let me suggest to you that my playing field is not normally before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| If you want to talk, you need to go into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8974)|
| 2:29:35| I thought I was going to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| Very briefly, because we've been on this for an hour and it's going to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| And, Mr. Moncier, if you'd also answer this last question when you're responding, that is, if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8979)|
| 2:29:46| what the state of this pending litigation that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8986)|
| 2:29:51| Well, the litigation first is primarily directed toward Timothy Hutchinson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| receiving $1.6 million out of this new plan that he never put a penny into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| and whether he was qualified for it, and that's not of concern to you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| The second is that the voters approved one plan on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| When the pension board got the plan, they wrote rules and regulations for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| and they included a whole section of employees of the sheriff's department that are not uniformed deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9017)|
| 2:30:26| such as bailiffs, clerks, park officers, process servers, and I don't know where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9026)|
| 2:30:37| Somebody just stuck it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| That's costing Knox County a large part of the money you have here that was never in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| This was meant for the uniformed deputies who carry guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| It wasn't meant for park rangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| It wasn't meant for court bailiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| But yet, when the pension board got it, somebody just threw that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| Don't know who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| Now, those are the two lawsuits I have pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| The third lawsuit is whether or not a county commission that consisted of eight term-limited appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9060)|
| 2:31:13| could put it on for the first reading and then it go over to the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9073)|
| 2:31:19| to the persons who were appointed after September 1 of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9079)|
| 2:31:26| Now, the courts have so far held that a lot of those questions are moot, and I suspect that I'll deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9086)|
| 2:31:34| However, I want to urge you all to understand that there are disagreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| very professional disagreements, not personal disagreements, over this vested issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9100)|
| 2:31:47| You're going to find one attorney say one thing and another attorney say another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| For the taxpayers that I represent, that's what we've got courts to decide by declaratory judgment actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9113)|
| 2:32:02| These actions, my friend, do not need to be personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9122)|
| 2:32:06| They have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| I work very well with your current law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| He listens to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| He answers my telephone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9132)|
| 2:32:15| When we have questions as to who is or who is not vested in this case, let us join hands together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9135)|
| 2:32:23| Let us put it before judges and the courts to decide these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9143)|
| 2:32:30| Don't bicker between one and another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| I have no personal interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| I represent a bunch of taxpayers that are trying to make sure that we follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9155)|
| 2:32:42| and I offer to you all to join together to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9162)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| Let me respond to a couple of things that Mr. Monsier stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| and I would like for Mr. Mason to have an opportunity to address what I say, if you would, please, Mr. Mason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9172)|
| 2:33:01| In terms of the contention, and I don't want to comment specifically on any pending litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| but generally the matter of vesting is an issue that has been litigated and decided extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9187)|
| 2:33:19| And, again, please, Mr. Mason is the expert and attorney for the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9199)|
| 2:33:26| but what constitutes vesting in terms of credit for years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9206)|
| 2:33:32| and things of that nature, if you have a change or a new plan, typically is governed by the language in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| And if the plan says that someone is going to be given credit for prior years of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9219)|
| 2:33:47| and that will constitute vesting, then that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9227)|
| 2:33:53| Is that correct, Mr. Mason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Yes, sir, and this question about old benefits and new benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9235)|
| 2:34:01| or future accrued benefits has also been decided in that same Tennessee Supreme Court case more than 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9241)|
| 2:34:14| decided these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| The rules are not the same for a governmental plan such as ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| as would be applicable to a private plan covered by ERISA where the employer might have greater flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9261)|
| 2:34:30| The other point, as the Deputy Law Director is looking at the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| is that the plan document itself also provides for the plan to be funded on an actuarially sound basis also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9276)|
| 2:34:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| There have been some references made to letting the voters decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| I would just remind our colleagues that you're looking at a general election in August of 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9295)|
| 2:35:01| where it could be put on the ballot unless we have a special election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| and I don't know that we as a body would go there unless there was a petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| So my point is that for this coming budget year and probably for the next budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9308)|
| 2:35:15| we're going to need to be dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| But if it does go on the ballot, you're looking at August 2010 at the earliest unless there is some type of special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9317)|
| 2:35:26| Very briefly, this can be answered by yes or no, and I think I heard Mr. Bill there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| Are jurisdictions such as the City of Knoxville, Knox County exempt from ERISA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9332)|
| 2:35:36| that is Employees Retirement Income Security Act, or subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9336)|
| 2:35:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| Completely exempt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9341)|
| 2:35:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| John, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| I'll make it very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| When the pension plans were adopted, there was about a $96 million prior service cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| and that's the estimate that we got from our actuaries as calculated that here's the value of how much the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9355)|
| 2:36:03| and benefits that the officers have already earned when the plan was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9363)|
| 2:36:09| Knox County has a Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| The officers gave up $39 million of their accounts to make a deposit into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9372)|
| 2:36:18| and the county made a deposit of 57 million round numbers into the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| and that is a separate account overseen by the Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9382)|
| 2:36:26| and it's vested under the jurisdiction of the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| The purpose of making those deposits and sending that money aside was to give the officers the assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9390)|
| 2:36:37| that when the benefits were needed or when the money was needed to pay the benefits, the money would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9397)|
| 2:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, just to follow up on what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| Mr. Jarrett, the Chief Deputy, has provided to me in Section 705D of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9412)|
| 2:37:03| the last sentence of that paragraph provides the officer's pension is not subject to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9423)|
| 2:37:11| and is specifically hereby accepted from the actuarially funded requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9431)|
| 2:37:18| contained in Sections 602C-7, 702C, and 604E-7, 704E of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9438)|
| 2:37:30| So bottom line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| Bottom line is it's my understanding that at the time Mr. Monsier says bottom line is he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9453)|
| 2:37:45| I wasn't saying that you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| I was just saying you were saying you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9466)|
| 2:37:54| As I recall, at the time this charter amendment was on the ballot, this language was included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9474)|
| 2:38:06| Again, I'm talking off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| It was included because while the amendment was on the ballot to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9489)|
| 2:38:17| it was not at the same time funded, meaning that it could be voted on and perhaps adopted by the voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9497)|
| 2:38:27| but was not funded at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| Now, the phrase actuarially funded is in quotation marks in this sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9510)|
| 2:38:39| and it refers back to other sections of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| And I see Mr. Mason's stand to address that, so I'll defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| So basically, from what you've read, there is an area which may need to be decided by the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9528)|
| 2:38:54| as to whether or not this specific plan needs to be actuarially funded, quote, actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9534)|
| 2:39:03| Well, I think that, number one, for something to go into the court, there has to be a dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9543)|
| 2:39:11| And if it is being actuarially, this says that it doesn't have to be, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9551)|
| 2:39:18| But if it is being actuarially funded, I don't see where there is a dispute for the courts to decide, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9558)|
| 2:39:27| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| So, number two, the question of, you know, what actuarially funded means today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9569)|
| 2:39:38| when the plan itself says that it is to be actuarially funded, again, I see no dispute to be decided by the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9578)|
| 2:39:49| If, you know, we were in a position where there was a decision made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9589)|
| 2:39:57| and someone was attempting to rely on this and say, well, we're not going to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| to rise to the level that Mr. Cross mentions to be actuarially sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| then you might have competing provisions that would require construction by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| But at this point, you know, if it is to be actuarially funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9615)|
| 2:40:21| I don't see why or what it is that a judge would be called upon to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9621)|
| 2:40:31| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| We've been on this subject for a long time, and I'm going to ask that we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9635)|
| 2:40:41| We've taken up a lot of time on this, and we haven't yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| The mayor is going to present us a budget, and we'll see how it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| Bob Cross is going to present to us what the numbers are here in another month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| and I'm going to suggest that we move on to the rest of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9655)|
| 2:41:00| Definitely we'll come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| One team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| approving the appointment of as judicial commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9671)|
| 2:41:14| Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9680)|
| 2:41:28| No recommendation, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| Yes, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| Do you have something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9696)|
| 2:41:40| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9700)|
| 2:41:41| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| Over the past week or so, as I've been out at Sunshine meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| I've been hearing a great deal of grumbling among my colleagues that nobody really knows why we're doing this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9709)|
| 2:41:58| Nobody understands what the problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| A lot of people don't even understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| And this was very obvious when we had the meeting where we interviewed the people who are asking for these positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9724)|
| 2:42:10| that a lot of people don't even understand what a judicial commissioner does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| And my feeling is that in order for us to do this fairly and for us to do this correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| we need to postpone this and have a workshop where the judges who are the judges asking for new judicial commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9741)|
| 2:42:29| is the police department asking for new judicial commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| There's a lot of us with a lot of questions that haven't been answered during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| and I think that this would be a good thing for us to study up on a little bit more before we start appointing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| Mr. Broyles, to answer your question, we don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| The reason why we're hearing this today is that they're appointed for a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| They're appointed for three-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| That actually came to an end, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| Three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| Well, actually, over six months ago, it was in July, the commission at that time extended their terms for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9783)|
| 2:43:12| so that we would have a chance to advertise this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| and to see if there were any more applicants that would be interested in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9798)|
| 2:43:25| But the time was not improved by the commission educating itself about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9805)|
| 2:43:30| Well, you know, in order, the six months, their terms end January 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9810)|
| 2:43:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Well, then let's schedule a really quick workshop and a special meeting and do it by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9824)|
| 2:43:51| Well, you're welcome to make any motion you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| I did have conversations with the law director, and it was his suggestion that we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9836)|
| 2:44:02| And I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| We have some good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| We're not here to decide whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9847)|
| 2:44:15| Let's just take this one step at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| We have three positions that their terms end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9857)|
| 2:44:23| We've already extended it for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| We have a number of applicants, including those that are currently in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9866)|
| 2:44:34| And it's not whether or not we want to reappoint them or not, but who are we going to appoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9874)|
| 2:44:41| To me, whether or not someone is currently in the position is no different than someone who's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9881)|
| 2:44:48| because they're all just applicants for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9888)|
| 2:44:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9892)|
| 2:44:53| My concern is that so many of the commissioners didn't even seem to understand what a judicial commissioner did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9893)|
| 2:45:00| It's my concern that we're appointing people to jobs that we, you know, a lot of the commissioners aren't familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9900)|
| 2:45:07| don't understand what the job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| And yet we're being asked to appoint people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| This is not something that we would be doing to make the benefit of the people who are asking for appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9912)|
| 2:45:20| It would benefit the commission, I would think, to learn a little bit more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| And I especially would like to hear from some of the judges and some of the people from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9924)|
| 2:45:31| If they are asking for changes, I would like to know what those changes are that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9931)|
| 2:45:37| I haven't heard any of that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| Well, Commissioner, it was my understanding that the judges were invited to be at the public hearing we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9939)|
| 2:45:49| And I believe we do have some of the judges here, if they'd like to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| Judge, if you want to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9955)|
| 2:45:58| I'm Jeff Emory, General Sessions Court Judge, 67 City County Building, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9958)|
| 2:46:05| Commissioner, there is a state law, 40-1-11, which sets up an office of judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9965)|
| 2:46:16| Depending on the classification of the county and its population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| how those persons are selected or appointed is different depending on the section that applies to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9980)|
| 2:46:28| Under 40-1-11, the legislative body of this county, which is you all, make appointment of the judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9988)|
| 2:46:39| It's a legislative appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| Their term is set by you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| Not less than one year, not more than four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10004)|
| 2:46:48| They sign warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| They review applications for bond, for forfeiture warrants, judicial acts not covered by the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10011)|
| 2:46:59| They serve 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| They are around-the-clock function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| They service the public for intake purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| They service the police officers when they need warrant signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10030)|
| 2:47:16| You all control how that appointment process takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| That statute also says that they have to be ratified by a majority of the Sessions Court judges after your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10041)|
| 2:47:31| And that's now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| Several years ago, they all were up at the same time, and then you all adopted a position of staggering the terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| Three of those commissioners' appointments were up last, what month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10059)|
| 2:47:44| October, somewhere around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10064)|
| 2:47:45| July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| Apparently, six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| And more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10067)|
| 2:47:48| Then there are more that are due in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| I think three are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| And then you just carried them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| By resolution, you carried them over until this day, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| That's about all I've got to say about it, unless you have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| Mr. Chairman, if I'm not mistaken, Ms. Brewers, this is just like all appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| They're all handled like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| They serve a certain length of time, whether you know what it is or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| But most of the older commissioners here know because we have appointed these judicial commissioners before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10090)|
| 2:48:16| But I believe the reason this was postponed, it was this commission's intent that we voted that all boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10096)|
| 2:48:24| committees, and commissions would be term limited like everything else in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10104)|
| 2:48:30| And that's why it was extended, if I'm not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| Now, some of the people came up here and said, well, they couldn't get anybody to take these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| And that's why we postponed it to see if anybody would come forward, if I'm not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| Now we have 13 people out here wanting these jobs instead of just the same three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10121)|
| 2:48:47| I guess I'm just concerned because I've heard that there are, you know, thank you, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10127)|
| 2:48:58| that there have been requests from police officers and from judges that there be changes made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10138)|
| 2:49:08| I have not received a request from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| Well, to tell you the truth, the only thing that I have heard personally is from people who have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10151)|
| 2:49:17| the three people you've got are good, reappoint them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| So that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10161)|
| 2:49:22| I'm just trying to get as much information as possible for us to be able to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10162)|
| 2:49:29| And I understand that the commissioners who have more seniority have been through this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10169)|
| 2:49:33| and probably understand this a lot better than those of us who are newer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| But I think that it was very obvious at the interview process last week that a lot of the commissioners were very confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10178)|
| 2:49:48| about what even a judicial commissioner did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| There were a lot of commissioners who weren't even there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| So I'm just concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| But if everybody's comfortable going forward, then obviously we'll go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| Does anyone else have any questions on Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| I was just made aware recently this week that my ability to vote based on conflict of interest has been called into question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10207)|
| 2:50:17| due to where I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| I've checked with the law department, and Mr. Lockett feels that I have no conflict of interest voting for a judicial commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10219)|
| 2:50:30| The question was that I would be going before these people to obtain a warrant to get for work as I work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10230)|
| 2:50:43| But I feel as anybody that starts in the part of the warrant process has to go before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| So that's a potential conflict for any commissioner that needs to get a warrant to be a victim of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| I just so happen to be an affiant more on a daily basis than somebody on commission normally would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10255)|
| 2:51:02| So to get that out in the open, there was a conflict of interest question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| I checked with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10266)|
| 2:51:07| The law department has cleared me to vote on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| What's the salary on this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| Sixty-four something, and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| And benefits too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| Full benefits plus 64, and we're appointing them for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10281)|
| 2:51:24| So you're looking at about a quarter of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10289)|
| 2:51:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| I'm one of the members of the subcommittee that was responsible for the meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| And the thing that struck me about the process that Ms. Poyles alluded to was it's kind of confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10301)|
| 2:51:51| certainly, about how we're supposed to make this selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10311)|
| 2:51:58| And in my efforts to interview people and interview the court, in all the questions that I got or I posed for those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10318)|
| 2:52:10| I never was able to determine that any of the three people that are up for reappointment did anything but an acceptable job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10330)|
| 2:52:21| And, therefore, I really don't understand, although we have many very qualified people that are applying for the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10341)|
| 2:52:32| I really don't understand how you replace someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10352)|
| 2:52:37| I don't consider someone who is in a position as equal to an applicant, as has been alluded to formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10357)|
| 2:52:48| I would consider the people who have 14 years' experience in this position to be highly qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10368)|
| 2:52:56| and acceptable unless there's something that prevents them from being so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10376)|
| 2:53:03| And as far as I can tell, there is no such reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10383)|
| 2:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| Commissioner Leuthold, there are five of these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10393)|
| 2:53:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10396)|
| 2:53:17| We're interviewing three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10397)|
| 2:53:18| So let me just put out on the table, Judge Emory mentioned they work 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| I think they work eight-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| Is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| Well, there's two more that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| Eight and 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| Okay, eight and 12-hour shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10411)|
| 2:53:32| Twelve hours on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10412)|
| 2:53:33| I will just repeat myself from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| If you do the math, 8,000-odd hours in a year divided by five, it's about a 32- or 33-hour-a-week job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| I'm not saying that critically, but it is considered a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| However, it does offer attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| Some of them have private practices, and I think that's good that they have the initiative of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10429)|
| 2:53:54| We heard that the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| And we all know attorneys making a million dollars a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| but we probably know attorneys making $20,000 a year too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| So it's not that bad, 64,000, an average of 33 hours, full benefits, health insurance, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10441)|
| 2:54:08| It's not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| It's not a throwaway job, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| We can see by the caliber of the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| and the incumbents wanting to come back that it's probably a pretty good job in this climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| And I'm just looking at the spirit of what Commissioner Pinkston mentioned, the spirit of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10457)|
| 2:54:23| You know, we all are subject to term limits, and about everybody in the elective office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| outside of judges, I guess, or maybe school board or something, and, of course, Congress, state guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| But us local, you know, we're subject to term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| And I think that's not necessarily that these people have not done a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| but by the term limit, the emphasis on that in society today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10478)|
| 2:54:45| I think that's why we should look at this closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10485)|
| 2:54:48| and whether just automatically reappoint incumbents because they've done a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10488)|
| 2:54:52| or look at other applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10496)|
| 2:54:57| I believe you're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| This commission voted unanimously, including Commissioner Norman there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| that we look at these things about being term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10503)|
| 2:55:07| They came up, people came up and spoke about it, and we voted for term limits on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10507)|
| 2:55:11| even though my understanding with the law director is the former law director didn't include it that way in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10511)|
| 2:55:19| But people want term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| You can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10522)|
| 2:55:24| And I just think that, you know, because you have the experience, we're not appointing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10524)|
| 2:55:31| and I really believe this is our problem in our country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| We've got these federal judges that are there for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| We have the Supreme Court that are there for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10539)|
| 2:55:42| These aren't for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10542)|
| 2:55:43| If someone takes this job three years from now, if they haven't done a good job, we send them down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10543)|
| 2:55:49| put someone else in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| But I don't think anybody is entitled to keep these jobs forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10551)|
| 2:56:01| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10563)|
| 2:56:04| The years that I've been on this body, I have always voted because I feel like the people sent me here to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| However, on this one, I don't feel like I can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| I will need to pass on each of these if we vote on them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10573)|
| 2:56:16| I was not at the meeting where the people came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| I haven't had time to really talk with folks about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| And even though I want to make a decision, feel like I need to, I want to make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| So I will be passing today simply because I just haven't had time to do my homework on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| And, again, I want to apologize to my citizens in the district because I've never passed on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| but I feel like I will need to do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10594)|
| 2:56:38| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| You know, first off, I wasn't appointed chair of the subcommittee until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10602)|
| 2:56:48| We had our so then, of course, you had the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| I'm not trying to make excuses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| And we were still having some applicants come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10613)|
| 2:56:58| We had the first of the year arranged to have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| so that we could have the folks that have applied a chance to come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10623)|
| 2:57:11| and present themselves just like Commissioner Carringer did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090126?start=10631)|
