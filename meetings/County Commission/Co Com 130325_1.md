| 2:31:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| Hold on, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| Mr. Armstrong, would the so you're are you referring or inferring with this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| or I guess the mayor's office or somebody is referring to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| is inferring that what we're currently under, the resolutions we're currently under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| is not in accordance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9095)|
| 2:31:39| No, I'm not inferring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| That issue has not come up before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| How this started was I believe they were wanting to reduce debt by selling the surplus county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9105)|
| 2:31:52| It came before this body, and on that debate you said by designating it, it would tie your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9112)|
| 2:32:00| So you changed it to preferring to reduce debt with this particular legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9120)|
| 2:32:08| During your dialogue on that, you finally said let's just do it in accordance with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| and not specialize it one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| And the question of the legality of the existing resolutions has never been brought before this body at this time yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9138)|
| 2:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| When did they add in the repealing of all resolutions to the extent of its conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9150)|
| 2:32:37| When was that added in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Was that added in this week or was that added in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| No, that's been there from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| I'm familiar with one resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| Are there three in conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| Is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9176)|
| 2:32:58| They're not really in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| It just says it will repeal them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9180)|
| 2:33:03| It says it will repeal any and all resolutions to the extent of its conflict with this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9183)|
| 2:33:08| including but not limited to resolutions 610, 901, 611, 907, 942, 923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| And I have those three right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| And two of them I want to point out are joint resolutions between the commission and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| So I don't know that we can rescind those without working it somehow with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9203)|
| 2:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| I had a couple of questions on this that maybe the law director can help us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| We've got another resolution coming up about who is going to pay for these resource officers at some of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9223)|
| 2:33:51| And is it my understanding that even if it's in the school's general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9231)|
| 2:33:57| that the county commission still has to authorize the release of that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9237)|
| 2:34:05| The school's budget in terms of appropriation is the same as any other county organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| So if you have a line item change, it has to be appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| If they put it in their upcoming budget, it has to be appropriated in accordance with their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9253)|
| 2:34:19| If they change or amend their budget, it has to be reapproved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| And on this resolution that we're considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| it says providing for the proceeds of sale of the county's surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| Is that in the broad term of including the school's property or is it just --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| I mean, it might be property that's being used by the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| But does this --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| Because some of the school -- some of the property is titled to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| and some of the property is titled to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| Is this referring to all property or is it just to property that's titled to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| This resolution refers to only property that is titled to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| If it is titled to the schools and the schools surplus it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| and then by statute, once again by state law, those resources would go directly to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9298)|
| 2:35:06| I guess my question is why are we -- why is this going to the education committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9306)|
| 2:35:12| Because if this is county property and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| we just got through saying where it deals with all of these things is that we need to look at this as all being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9315)|
| 2:35:21| whether it's school debt, county debt, county property, school property, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| To me, there's a distinct advantage of having this going to reducing the county's debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| because our bond rating improves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| We have a lot of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| Even if it goes to the school's general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| they can't spend the money without authorization from the county commission anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9338)|
| 2:35:44| I mean, to me, it seems like it would make more sense for it to --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| I mean, if it's county property, it ought to go to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| There's a lot of advantages that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| I'd like to go before you just --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| I can answer his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| I know you want to answer his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| Do you have something else, Dr. Brewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| No, I just had questions on this because it --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| Let me just finish because it seems to me that I don't know why we're sending this to the Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9367)|
| 2:36:13| I think we ought to go ahead and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| I think it makes sense to reduce the county's debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| We just got through, unless we want to listen to it again, which I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| we just got through listening to a very detailed, a lot of detailed reasons about why it's good not to have so much debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9381)|
| 2:36:29| And the schools can't spend the money, but this would help our bond rating if, you know, if we had less debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9389)|
| 2:36:36| This resolution doesn't call for it to pay for our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| It says it goes according to Tennessee code annotated, which would put it in our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| Well, it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| If our general fund, it still deals with our bond rating and a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| If it goes into the general fund of the county, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| If it goes into reducing county debt, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| But we shouldn't sell this as a debt reduction resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| I know, but what I meant in general is that it helps the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| It helps the bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| It helps the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| It helps everybody that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| I didn't want to stick in my two cents here just before you guys go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| The original resolution, so-named the Pinkston Resolution, was I think the intent was, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9434)|
| 2:37:23| to help the school system sort of incentivize them into doing something with properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9443)|
| 2:37:31| before they deteriorate to an extent where there's just a tremendous financial burden on the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9451)|
| 2:37:38| And so what I feel, you know, and I'm not getting into saying this is illegal necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9458)|
| 2:37:46| but it seems like it's our duty as the funding body for the county, it's our duty to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9466)|
| 2:37:55| and given what state law says, how can we not go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| and say this money has to come back to the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9480)|
| 2:38:04| And so on the issue of how the money is spent, regardless, as we've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9484)|
| 2:38:11| if it goes back into the general fund, we still can determine how we want to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9491)|
| 2:38:18| It's a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9498)|
| 2:38:22| If we surplused property and we had half a million dollars that we received from that surplusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9502)|
| 2:38:30| we could appropriate that directly to the school system for some purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9510)|
| 2:38:36| So it's still the body's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| And so for us to do otherwise, I think, is to deny our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9519)|
| 2:38:47| That's our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| So I'll be going to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9529)|
| 2:38:55| I'm speaking against, of course, this substitute motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| Go ahead, Ms. Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9540)|
| 2:39:01| And I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| I'm concerned that you've not the conversation up until now has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9543)|
| 2:39:09| we've had all this conversation about this would not automatically go to the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9549)|
| 2:39:13| I mean, Brad is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9553)|
| 2:39:14| We can't sell this as a debt thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| But the reason that we wanted to send it to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| or that I think it needs to be sent to this joint committee is because in the body of the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9560)|
| 2:39:26| it repeals three previous resolutions, two of which are joint resolutions by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9566)|
| 2:39:36| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| And, again, there's no big, there's nothing on, we haven't sold anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| There's nothing on the table that we have to decide what to do with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| There's no rush to do this right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| I am concerned about the state of our relationship with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| And this is yet one more example where there's this rush to step on their toes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9597)|
| 2:40:02| and tell them what we think is best for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9602)|
| 2:40:06| And one of the reasons that we had put this education committee together was to try to resolve some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9606)|
| 2:40:15| so that they don't become contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| So, and like I said, when I read this further and realized that it was going to repeal these three specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9618)|
| 2:40:27| these three specific resolutions, and I went and read those three resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| and realized that two of them were actually joint resolutions with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| it seemed very inappropriate for us to act on this right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| And I know that Karen is, Karen Carson is here, and I'd just like to ask her if she,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| would you like to come speak, Karen, to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| Does anybody have any questions for Karen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| Well, frankly, I am disappointed in some of the attitudes about our relationship with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9658)|
| 2:41:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9672)|
| 2:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9676)|
| 2:41:17| You know, I guess this, to me, is kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9677)|
| 2:41:27| You know, we sat here for an hour or more and listened to what I thought was a pretty darn good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9687)|
| 2:41:35| and overall talk about how we deal with debt and how, you know, some of the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9695)|
| 2:41:43| and how the bonding agencies, the people in the know that, you know, know what bonding agencies look for and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9703)|
| 2:41:52| And we took from that, if we pay down our debt another couple, you know, 10 to $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| that will make all things go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| No, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9720)|
| 2:42:01| That's what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| No, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9722)|
| 2:42:03| So then we go back and say, you know, if we can start to take these properties and pay off our debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| we can get a better bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| No, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| You know, then I say, well, raising taxes, will that take our bond rating up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9732)|
| 2:42:18| No, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| No, it won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| Let's talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| What this issue does is put a wedge between us and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| If that's what we want to do, there's some people out here that want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| The first REV would have done that with a, you know, a two-foot wedge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| And this is more like a three- or four-inch wedge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| But it's a wedge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| This does nothing to advance, to help our financial situation out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| That's a load, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9765)|
| 2:42:48| And I think we all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| What this does is it's divisive to take away these resolutions without even discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9770)|
| 2:42:58| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| Without even discussing it with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9779)|
| 2:43:02| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9782)|
| 2:43:03| We're not passing anything that's going to make us a better county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| Because at the end of the day, if people in 1945 or 1965 gave money to build a school for educating our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9787)|
| 2:43:16| in 2015, they're probably still going to want those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| If that lady or gentleman who gave those taxes for that school, they probably would say, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9801)|
| 2:43:27| I'd still like for that money to stay in the educational pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| I think we all can agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| We don't want to spend this money if in ten years we need a new prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| We don't want to spend this money for a new prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| I mean, this money was given for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| But that's not really germane and not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| I think what we're dealing with is just divisive issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| This is piddly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| If it passes, okay, it'll be a slap against the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| Yay, we can go home and cheer some of us that want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9833)|
| 2:43:57| We can go home and cheer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| We did another slap against the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| And it's not I'm pro-school board, anti-commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| I'm just like, let's talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| Let's have open dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| There's been no dialogue on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| And we're about to force it down the county's throat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| So, you know, I guess I just don't like the way this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| And if this passes, again, it won't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| We'll still have things to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| But let's stop this every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| Let's do a appointed school board superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9872)|
| 2:44:36| Let's take away their physical plans and make it more general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| I just wish we'd get away from this and start getting to the business of how do we serve all of our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9881)|
| 2:44:48| how do we have an open and honest dialogue about something, and then make an informed decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9888)|
| 2:44:54| So that's all this is really asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| We're not saying don't pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| But we're saying let's think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| Has anyone read those three resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| Have we all read those three resolutions that it's going to repeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| Probably not all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| So, you know, that's my plea is that we just postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| There's no difference between this month and next month, zero difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| Nothing's coming before us between now and then, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9918)|
| 2:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9919)|
| 2:45:20| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| I've got a response to a couple of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| One is I think it just depends on your perspective about what an issue like this does with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9923)|
| 2:45:32| I feel like it may not drive a wedge so much as to help us define really what is our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9932)|
| 2:45:42| We've had an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| In fact, we had a meeting a month ago with the Education Committee where this item was before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9943)|
| 2:45:50| and they knew it was before, you know, it's an item that's floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9950)|
| 2:45:56| But, of course, the security issue just kind of trumped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9956)|
| 2:45:59| So I don't see it as an opportunity to drive a wedge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| I think, again, it's our duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| It's our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9966)|
| 2:46:08| This is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9968)|
| 2:46:09| The thing that I'm really interested about reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| and comprehending is that this is in accord with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9973)|
| 2:46:18| I don't understand how we can do other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9978)|
| 2:46:22| and I certainly don't need a committee meeting to discuss that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| It just seems like that is a total waste of time and an opportunity to confuse the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9987)|
| 2:46:34| This is state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| That's all we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| We're adhering to our responsibility if we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| I don't see how we can do otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10004)|
| 2:46:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| And I can say these three previous resolutions were not in conflict with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10006)|
| 2:46:53| And I wanted to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| Two of these are joint resolutions with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| So I guess we have the power to repeal our part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10021)|
| 2:47:11| Does it also have to go before the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| I mean, what are the legal ramifications of repealing one half of a joint resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10033)|
| 2:47:19| And, you know, Tony, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| We should be doing it according to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| We have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| This does not correct any illegalities that have been taking place up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10044)|
| 2:47:37| Mr. Armstrong, could you respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| And your question specifically, Commissioner Gabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| Two of these three resolutions that are singled out to be repealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10064)|
| 2:47:50| two of them are joint resolutions between the commission and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| So we're repealing our half of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| Well, under the current resolution, there's three resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| One's an amendment to the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| It was a single resolution by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| You can deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| The other two resolutions in the caption that were said that they were joint resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| in terms of the resolutions passed were executed only by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10095)|
| 2:48:22| So it's a single resolution before you because they have not been executed by both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10102)|
| 2:48:29| So I don't know where it went, how it went beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| But that's the final resolution that's on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| Whether they ever voted on it or not, I have no idea because it's not executed by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| So where it stands for me right now is I have a single resolution of a joint proposed resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10121)|
| 2:48:47| that was passed by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| That's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| So even though it says that these are joint resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10130)|
| 2:48:54| you have no idea whether or not the school board did their part of it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10134)|
| 2:48:58| The only thing I know is that it was only executed by county commission and signed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10138)|
| 2:49:06| I can't comment beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| I really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| And, again, there is no rush to get any of this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10151)|
| 2:49:18| And, again, I think we are being very disrespectful of both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10158)|
| 2:49:31| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10171)|
| 2:49:34| Commissioner McKenzie, I appreciate what you said and understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| You know, I don't want to feel like we're one body better than the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| as school board versus county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| I consider them my friends and have a dialogue with those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| But I just want to reiterate, Commissioner, Mr. Chairman, you mentioned it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10189)|
| 2:49:54| You'll see in here in big bold letters it says deferred from January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| They've had it for two months and have not gotten back with us on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| So that's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10204)|
| 2:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10206)|
| 2:50:07| I just want to make a comment that I think that the surplus property ought to be turned back over to the county to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10207)|
| 2:50:16| either to sell or to maintain or whatever, for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| It's not that I'm disrespectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| It's not that we're trying to drive a wedge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| It's just how can it best be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| If there's property that's not being used any longer by the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10227)|
| 2:50:32| then, you know, they don't need to be spending time on the school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10232)|
| 2:50:38| They don't need to be expending resources to maintain property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| They need to be spending their time and money educating kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10241)|
| 2:50:45| And if they turn this back over to the county, we may have to spend the money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10249)|
| 2:50:50| That's part of our duties is to take care of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| We may decide it's not worth trying to let the property deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| It may not be worth it to try to spend a lot of money to keep the roof on a school that we're never going to use again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| And that way the property can be sold and the money can be the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| and the responsibilities of the property then go to whoever bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| And we can put those funds to use elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| The school board, and I hope they don't disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10273)|
| 2:51:16| is that they need to be coming up with policies and things and using their money and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10276)|
| 2:51:20| and energy to educate kids not on managing property and maintaining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10280)|

| 2:54:19| Okay motion to approve and a second. Do we have any discussion? Mr. McKenzie. Now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| this the one that had the this had the amendment on it correct? The amendment with the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10466)|
| 2:54:34| what was the and what was our amendment? The law director answered my question. Yeah it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| does have the amendment I don't know the exact wording of the amendment but it has something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10481)|
| 2:54:44| to do with the preference to or something of funding it. Yeah the fact that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10484)|
| 2:54:52| I think we acknowledged that this is going an ongoing cost. Right. You added natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10492)|
| 2:54:58| growth. All that good stuff. The phrase natural growth. Let's see if I can find my natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10498)|
| 2:55:06| growth comment. Just an affirmation it's an ongoing cost. Right yes it's in here. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10506)|
| 2:55:17| all I want. Okay any other discussion? I had a few questions. Dr. McIntyre. Thank you Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10517)|
| 2:55:43| The security issue there's of course is one that I'm sure you're getting a little over burdened with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10543)|
| 2:55:53| But there seems to be a few questions that I still have about this issue. First of all just numbers of officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10553)|
| 2:56:04| So on the issue of officers and in terms of providing SROs we had a number of 58 is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10564)|
| 2:56:16| So the proposal in the recommended fiscal year 14 budget that's before the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10576)|
| 2:56:26| would include an additional 58 school security officers for the coming school year yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10586)|
| 2:56:31| Okay if there's are the sheriff's deputies and KPD officers are the ones that are in place now are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10591)|
| 2:56:42| are we still going to have the same arrangement with county and KPD? Yes sir that's our understanding is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10602)|
| 2:56:49| they will continue to deploy 24 sheriff's deputies and 17 KPD officers for service in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10609)|
| 2:56:57| And that's middle and high school? It generally is yes sir. Generally okay and then I guess that's where I was a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10617)|
| 2:57:04| confused about and we had 39 SROs in place that you have in place. We have 39 day shift school security officers yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10624)|
| 2:57:15| Okay so I was just curious about the number then that doesn't add up to the number of buildings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10635)|
| 2:57:22| It adds up to more than the number of buildings that we have. Okay and so why is that necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| So the idea is to make sure that we have a robust deployment matrix that allows us to have at least one school at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10646)|
| 2:57:34| officer in every school. We will have more than one officer in several schools as the need is dictated and that's a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10654)|
| 2:57:42| that we've been having ongoing with both the Knoxville Police Department and the Sheriff's Office around what that deployment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10662)|
| 2:57:48| should look like. And we believe that this number of officers allows us to have a deployment that will allow us to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| officer assigned to every single school. Okay all right very good. It seems like the audit issue in terms of security of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10674)|
| 2:58:04| schools right now it's kind of I haven't heard anything I haven't I was just curious about that you know we were wrangling a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10684)|
| 2:58:13| little bit about well who's going to do the audit the mayor's going to do it or where school systems are going to do it where what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10693)|
| 2:58:19| the status of the audit? Well the Board of Education approved a plan for a contract audit a few weeks back and we've worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10699)|
| 2:58:30| Knox County Purchasing to develop an RFP and I believe that it actually hits the streets this week. And who's going to do the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10710)|
| 2:58:38| The contractor whoever responds to that RFP and is the successful bidder. Okay so Simplex Grinnell is one of the are they going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10718)|
| 2:58:48| in the mix or do we know? No Commissioner you may remember that Simplex is doing a they're doing a review of in two phases one the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10728)|
| 2:58:57| first phase is looking at twenty seven schools and they're looking at the functionality of our security alarm systems our video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10737)|
| 2:59:07| camera systems our keyless entry systems and those those that review is is is ongoing as well. So there's actually three pieces of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10747)|
| 2:59:20| that's happening. One is the review to make sure that our systems are working. The second is the contract audit to look at did we get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10760)|
| 2:59:28| about five or six schools to take a look at that in detail did we get what we paid for in the contract did it meet the specifications of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10768)|
| 2:59:34| contract at the time. And then the third is the Board of Education has asked us to look to develop a set a standard particularly around video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10774)|
| 2:59:43| camera systems that would determine what what do we need to have in terms of a standard for our video camera systems so that we can assess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10783)|
| 2:59:51| whether our current systems meet that need or not and and move moving forward make sure that our video systems meet that particular standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10791)|
| 3:00:00| in terms of clarity resolution functionality all of those types of density all those types of questions for video camera systems and then so is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10800)|
| 3:00:10| that those three pieces of work that are ongoing for you know this is a matter of perspective to I guess in terms of school security for for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10810)|
| 3:00:20| of us that have been a little closer to the issue. It seems like there were several missteps made in terms. Well and of course in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10820)|
| 3:00:35| PSCD and the contract etc. and all the various problems that are associated with that issue. Given now that we're going forward and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10835)|
| 3:00:47| expanding our efforts in security has the board in their discussion. Is there some more intense oversight on security from the board or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10847)|
| 3:01:02| is it are things going to proceed as they have in the past because I felt like the board just wasn't aware at all didn't display any real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10862)|
| 3:01:14| understanding of the kinds of problems that we had in security. So I just want you to characterize the discussion within the board for us now in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10874)|
| 3:01:24| of oversight. Now we're expanding security. We're expanding SROs. We're we're going to get information back from the audit. How are we going to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10884)|
| 3:01:36| And I think you know Miss Carson is here and she can certainly speak to that as well. But I mean I think the board very much has a strong sense of where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10896)|
| 3:01:45| going with school security and student safety. I think they have a deep sense of as I do of responsibility for making sure that we get it right. And I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10905)|
| 3:01:56| know Commissioner I think it's important to acknowledge that in December there was a major incident that occurred in Connecticut that really had an impact on how all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10916)|
| 3:02:07| view the safety of our schools and the security of our schools. And I think that's as we continue to move forward with all of these efforts and as we continue to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10927)|
| 3:02:17| at all of the strategies that we have in place and that we need to have in place in order to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep our kids safe that that's that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10937)|
| 3:02:26| been a conversation that has changed in the last six months. So that's a conversation where the expectations are very different today than they were even just a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10946)|
| 3:02:35| ago. And I think that we are working very diligently to make sure that we're meeting the heightened expectations that we and everyone in our community has around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10955)|
| 3:02:44| student safety and school security. And I think the board has a very strong sense of of of responsibility and a very deep level of engagement on that. OK. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10964)|
| 3:02:55| before you go one more question and then I'll let Miss Carson comment if she'd like to. The Ruth Ellis report. What is the status of that report right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10975)|
| 3:03:08| That investigation is ongoing and she Miss Ellis is working diligently and interviewing people and looking at documents and investigations ongoing. What is the scope of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10988)|
| 3:03:18| that report. What has she been charged with. She's been charged with looking at the relationship that Steve Griffin had with the vendor P.S.C.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=10998)|
| 3:03:29| and looking as to whether that relationship had had and what what what influence if any that relationship had on the procurement process and if there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11009)|
| 3:03:41| any improprieties in that or not. That's the scope of. Do we have any idea when her report will be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11021)|
| 3:03:50| I would say that her her investigation would be concluded within the next several weeks. OK. And how will you report on the report. That will be a that will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11030)|
| 3:04:04| a the investigation. She will report to me the findings of the investigation. I will seek to take any appropriate personnel action and of course share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11044)|
| 3:04:13| with the board and and the public. OK. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Carson would you like to respond to any of that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11053)|
| 3:04:26| I had my particular question was I do have a personal I mean concern that I felt like the board was just not aware of some serious serious things that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11066)|
| 3:04:42| left out of security the security system. And that's not just stuff in the Stansell report. I'm just talking about in general. So I just so as you go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11082)|
| 3:04:53| you've got heightened responsibility in terms of security and so I was curious how the board might view that responsibility. Commissioner I guess I would I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11093)|
| 3:05:05| respond to say I think if you can if you would like to name specific serious oversights that the board was not aware of beyond the Stansell report I'd be happy to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11105)|
| 3:05:17| each one and let you know if there is any difference. Well I'm I'm I'm just talking about security in general when you have cameras that don't have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11117)|
| 3:05:30| resolution to you know those types of technical issues as well as just in that totally inadequate security entries etc. etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11130)|
| 3:05:42| I mean you all have the responsibility now of having this minimum standard of security met in every school. How will you know it's being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11142)|
| 3:05:53| Well again I have to go to your first comment. I don't know that there has ever been a standard or a definition of what resolution needs to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11153)|
| 3:06:03| So I think it's a leap for you to say we were deficient or totally inadequate in any of those areas unless anyone can give me this is what the standard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11163)|
| 3:06:15| and where you failed to meet it. I think that Dr. McIntyre describes what is accurate and that the standard and the expectation has changed since December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11175)|
| 3:06:26| I think the board has been responsive from the moment that incident happened in Newtown. We have met talked about it before it ever got out of the papers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11186)|
| 3:06:39| and began addressing the issue then because I do believe the standard as far as expectation has changed. And we are absolutely addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11199)|
| 3:06:53| We're addressing it at a local level and we're also addressing it by looking at the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11213)|
| 3:07:01| I attended a conference in D.C. two weeks ago and I will tell you that every school community is asking the same questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11221)|
| 3:07:11| What is the standard? What should we expect? What can we do to make sure our schools are as safe and secure as they can be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11231)|
| 3:07:21| Our board is doing that and is absolutely right in step with everybody else trying to define that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11241)|
| 3:07:28| and trying to do it in a fiscally responsible way so that we don't have a knee-jerk reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11248)|
| 3:07:36| that really doesn't do a thing to change the safety and security but gives a perception of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11256)|
| 3:07:41| So I think we are addressing the issue very responsibly and proactively and will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11261)|
| 3:07:48| Okay. And my only response to that is it's not just what's happened since Sandy Hook that has made us feel insecure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11268)|
| 3:08:01| And it is not just that timeline that makes me feel, as we look at the school security issues, insecure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11281)|
| 3:08:12| It's the fact that the board did not know in 2008 and 2009 things that they should have known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11292)|
| 3:08:22| That's what I'm talking about. And those things are well documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| So I just want to implore that the board is more intensively involved than they have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11307)|
| 3:08:35| Well, I can't make that promise. I think the board is already intensively involved and we disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11315)|
| 3:08:41| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11321)|
| 3:08:52| Okay. We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| Opposed? Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11336)|
| 3:09:01| Okay. Ordinances on first reading, page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11341)|
| 3:09:05| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| amending Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 2 of the Knox County Code by adding a new Section 2-774,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11348)|
| 3:09:14| previously reserved to establish hiring preferences for military veterans in the Knox County Personnel Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11354)|
| 3:09:21| This is Ordinance No. 0-02-7-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| This was adopted August 26, 2002 on first reading, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11365)|

| 3:09:34| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11374)|
| 3:09:35| Just to save a lot of time, I don't know how anyone could do anything but vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11375)|
| 3:09:42| I don't know. We've had some discussions sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11382)|
| 3:09:45| I thought that before, but come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| I don't think we're safe on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11390)|
| 3:09:52| Opposed? Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11392)|
| 3:09:54| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| Commissioner Broilsman told me she had an emergency at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11396)|
| 3:09:58| She had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| So she had to step out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11399)|
| 3:10:00| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| This is an ordinance amending Knox County Code, Chapter 26, Article 6, entitled Stormwater Management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11404)|
| 3:10:11| in order to authorize the Director of Engineering and Public Works to establish reasonable fees in Section 26-153.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11411)|
| 3:10:18| This is Ordinance 0-07-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| This was adopted January 28, 2008 on first reading, Ordinance 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11423)|
| 3:10:30| Okay. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| Okay. Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11433)|
| 3:10:36| Okay. Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11436)|
| 3:10:38| Just to refresh our memories a little bit, because our stormwater group has done such a fantastic job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11438)|
| 3:10:47| they have now been authorized by the state to do local permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11447)|
| 3:10:51| So basically this is kind of the follow-up on that, and that's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11455)|
| 3:10:56| It's all now localized control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11456)|
| 3:11:00| Okay. Other items to discuss, other things to discuss there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11460)|
| 3:11:04| I wanted to offer a substitute motion, which I have run through Mr. VandeVate, and he seemed to be okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11464)|
| 3:11:14| This is the reading of my substitute motion, and this goes to my point that this is a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11474)|
| 3:11:22| The state fee structure that is in place could be used as a starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11482)|
| 3:11:30| but it could also be lowered at Mr. VandeVate's discretion, and I think fundamentally that's the issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11490)|
| 3:11:38| So here's the wording that I've got for my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11498)|
| 3:11:43| Authorize the director of engineering and public works to establish 100% of the state's fee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11503)|
| 3:11:54| with the discretionary ability of the director to reduce fees to 80% of that fee structure as he deems reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11514)|
| 3:12:09| Okay, that's my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| So what that would do is allow a little higher starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11532)|
| 3:12:16| and then still give the director the opportunity to lower it to 80% of the fee structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11536)|
| 3:12:22| which is what he had in the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11542)|
| 3:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11546)|
| 3:12:27| Okay, I've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11549)|
| 3:12:33| Okay, Dwight, would you, you know, I sprung this on you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| and so you may have had some hiccups or reconsiderations of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11558)|
| 3:12:45| Would that, do you think that will work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| Yes, sir, I think that would work fine for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| and it is consistent with what we've seen other qualifying local programs do in their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11570)|
| 3:12:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| Okay, so that's the substitute motion before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| 100% fee structure for the state with discretion to 80% down to 80% by the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11581)|
| 3:13:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11588)|
| 3:13:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11590)|
| 3:13:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11592)|
| 3:13:20| Okay, other business, discussion regarding the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11600)|
| 3:13:26| Okay, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11606)|
| 3:13:27| Do you want to do this now or after zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11607)|
| 3:13:30| Do you want to do it after zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| Okay, let's take a break here for five minutes or so, and then we'll get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11612)|
| 3:13:39| Maybe a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| Zonings portion of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11622)|
| 3:13:47| All right, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11627)|
| 3:13:53| Okay, do we need to call roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11633)|

| 3:19:06| Property located southwest side Dogwood Road southeast side of Solway Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11946)|
| 3:19:15| Okay, Mr. Seymour, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11955)|
| 3:19:19| Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue here on behalf of the appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11959)|

| 3:19:36| I have a motion to approve the appeal before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11978)|
| 3:19:39| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11979)|
| 3:19:40| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| What was the one condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11982)|
| 3:19:47| The property was previously zoned CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| but it could only be used for a church thrift shop and agricultural uses permitted under the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=11991)|
| 3:20:01| We're asking that those conditions be released and it carry the CA designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12001)|
| 3:20:09| No concerns over stormwater, none of that kind of stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12009)|
| 3:20:13| The buyer is buying an existing building that will require minimal changes to the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12013)|
| 3:20:21| but nothing to the footprint of the lot it's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| It's a four-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| I think they're adding some gravel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12026)|
| 3:20:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12027)|
| 3:20:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| And Mr. Kazana is representing Master Drive, the buyer, and he's here if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12030)|
| 3:20:37| Pastor Guerin and members of the church council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| Do we have any opposition here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12042)|
| 3:20:45| Okay, no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12045)|
| 3:20:46| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| I'd just like to hear from MPC as to what the Commission was thinking with their denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12048)|
| 3:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| The Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| In 2008, this property was rezoned from agricultural to the condition CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12061)|
| 3:21:07| to accommodate the desire of the church to operate a thrift store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12067)|
| 3:21:15| The condition was put in place because of the condition of Solway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12075)|
| 3:21:22| and its proximity or lack of proximity to Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| and a fairly dangerous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12088)|
| 3:21:31| Solway is classified as a minor collector and primarily residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12091)|
| 3:21:39| The entrance to the church is off of Solway, across the street from residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12099)|
| 3:21:46| that are on the northwest side of Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| I think at that time the Planning Commission recommended approval of the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12110)|
| 3:21:55| in order to allow the church to utilize it in a manner that was fairly consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12115)|
| 3:22:01| with the church uses as an accessory use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| but not inconsistent with the predominant residential character of Solway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12124)|
| 3:22:10| and the surrounding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12130)|
| 3:22:13| So this time the Planning Commission unanimously voted to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12133)|
| 3:22:20| based on the same reasons that nothing has changed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12140)|
| 3:22:24| The intersection at Pellissippi Parkway at Solway is still very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12144)|
| 3:22:31| Solway Road is still residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12151)|
| 3:22:35| The access to the property is still off of Solway across from residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12155)|
| 3:22:42| And the proposed use is much more intensive commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12162)|
| 3:22:48| than a thrift store associated with the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12168)|
| 3:22:52| Yeah, I tend to agree with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12172)|
| 3:22:54| You know, I traverse that road daily, twice daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| And, you know, when you're talking about a thriving business like Master Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12177)|
| 3:23:03| that does work not only all over this community but other counties as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12183)|
| 3:23:08| I'm sure you're talking about a high volume of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12188)|
| 3:23:11| And that just seems, again, just take a drive down through there about 4.30 in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12191)|
| 3:23:18| or about 7, 7.30 in the morning, and you'll kind of get a feel for what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12198)|
| 3:23:24| And, you know, I'm sure there are trucks that are going to both be deploying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12204)|
| 3:23:28| and returning back to the hub during those peak times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12208)|
| 3:23:32| And, you know, it still is a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| You probably wouldn't know it, but it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| And a lot of people, as Commissioner Anders can tell you, there's a lot of people in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12219)|
| 3:23:44| There's a bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| Buses make turns that scare me, you know, when I see them making those turns in terms of the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12226)|
| 3:23:55| You know, there's a lot of us that tend to speed down through that route as well, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12235)|
| 3:24:01| And so this doesn't seem to actually remember when the church came before us for that thrift store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12241)|
| 3:24:11| We had a conversation, I think, with Commissioner Lambert at the time about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| But this just seems to be kind of a dangerous type business in terms of volumes of trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12255)|
| 3:24:25| probably small trucks and things like that, that's going to be dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12265)|
| 3:24:29| They're going to get supplies delivered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| So this one troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12271)|
| 3:24:34| This appeal seems to trouble me some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12274)|
| 3:24:38| Okay, thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12278)|
| 3:24:40| Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| You have a motion to approve the appeal, a motion to grant the appeal on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12282)|
| 3:24:49| That will be to deny or overrule the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| I think Mr. Seymour will appreciate that I would ask him to address the appeal to provide a basis for the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12293)|
| 3:25:05| The only thing we have in this record is the recommendation from the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12305)|
| 3:25:10| I think the commission would benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12310)|
| 3:25:15| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12315)|
| 3:25:16| Go, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12316)|
| 3:25:17| I sent out a packet earlier, and this was in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12317)|
| 3:25:24| This is the church sanctuary and church offices right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12324)|
| 3:25:32| Mr. Chairman, could you get someone to hold his drawing so he can speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12332)|
| 3:25:38| Here is the church sanctuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12338)|
| 3:25:41| There is the church building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12341)|
| 3:25:44| This is the family life and where the thrift store was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12344)|
| 3:25:49| The building configuration will not be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| There will be some gravel added, and there will be an easement across the church property to get down to Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12351)|
| 3:25:59| And Dogwood goes into Solway right before it enters Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12359)|
| 3:26:08| The Master Dry has eight trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| What they do is basically do sealing of crawl spaces, basements, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12372)|
| 3:26:21| Those trucks and this business already operates in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| They're just out of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| They will have an office and some material there, but not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| Their trucks leave, according to Mr. Kazana, their representative, at 7 a.m. in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12392)|
| 3:26:39| and are gone to a job site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| No activity really occurs on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| They come back after five, after they're through with the various job sites they're going to around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12404)|
| 3:26:52| I would like to submit, for the record, a copy of the site plan and a petition from members of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12412)|
| 3:27:05| and also I included this in your packet, a description of the Master Dry proposed use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12425)|
| 3:27:16| It actually will be a very light touch on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12436)|
| 3:27:19| The reason being the building is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12439)|
| 3:27:24| It works perfectly for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12444)|
| 3:27:26| The size does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12446)|
| 3:27:27| It's in a great location for them to reach customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12447)|
| 3:27:32| not only in Knox, Anderson, Loudoun, and Blount County, but even as far as Rhone County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12452)|
| 3:27:38| The traffic, I mean, there are plenty of houses on Solway Road, and they keep building them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12458)|
| 3:27:48| There are some planned residential developments along there, granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12468)|
| 3:27:52| but this will be a very light touch as far as traffic is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12472)|
| 3:27:57| There will be nobody coming and going other than employees from the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12477)|
| 3:28:02| There will be no business conducted other than the normal office businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12482)|
| 3:28:08| The sector plan already calls for commercial for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12488)|
| 3:28:12| That was amended in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12492)|
| 3:28:15| So Master Dry found this to be a perfect location for them, and it met the needs of the church also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12495)|
| 3:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12507)|
| 3:28:28| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| I guess it should say Mr. Master Dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12514)|
| 3:28:37| You said there would be eight trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12517)|
| 3:28:42| Are we talking vans or are we talking semis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12522)|
| 3:28:47| We are talking about utility-type trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| They are not semis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| Sometimes they will have deliveries occasionally, usually once every two weeks of a larger size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12531)|
| 3:28:56| but certainly not a semi-type size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| Mr. Kazanas, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12542)|
| 3:29:03| Justin Kazana, 824 Handsmore Place, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| Any other questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12551)|
| 3:29:14| Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12554)|
| 3:29:15| Mr. Seymour, let me just ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| I'm a law director here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12557)|
| 3:29:18| I just want to divulge for the record my son does work for Master Dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| He does not live at the house with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| I make no monetary gain from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| Nobody from Master Dry has contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12566)|
| 3:29:29| Any questions or do you all see that I'm trying to decide whether or not to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12569)|
| 3:29:35| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12575)|
| 3:29:38| I don't see an ethical problem with it as long as the relationship with your son is not going to affect your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12578)|
| 3:29:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12586)|
| 3:29:47| Nobody has contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12587)|
| 3:29:48| What did you say, Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12588)|
| 3:29:49| I said only if it's a tie vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12589)|
| 3:29:52| I just wanted to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12592)|
| 3:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12593)|
| 3:29:54| I think you're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12594)|
| 3:29:56| I think you're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12596)|
| 3:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12598)|
| 3:29:59| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12599)|
| 3:30:03| Before us the motion to grant the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12609)|
| 3:30:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12612)|
| 3:30:13| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12613)|
| 3:30:27| On page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12627)|
| 3:30:33| Discussion regarding the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12633)|
| 3:30:36| Can I have one other zoning thing to bring up is right now there are three ordinances that are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12636)|
| 3:30:46| And I wanted to bring these up because I've discussed it with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12646)|
| 3:30:50| and the law director's office and we can't turn that over this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12650)|
| 3:30:54| One of those is one that I can't remember right now if I brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| or the MPC brought it up it had with banning all conventional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12657)|
| 3:31:01| The second one that's outstanding is banning electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12661)|
| 3:31:07| which are on premise electrical signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| And then the third one is the one that Commission Anders had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12670)|
| 3:31:14| And what we had done with the first two is that we had referred those to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12674)|
| 3:31:23| and they came back, I believe, the month after we referred those to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12683)|
| 3:31:29| saying that they really can't do use on reviews for ordinances and signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12689)|
| 3:31:35| They really just do that for property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12695)|
| 3:31:38| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| So these are out there, but that's all they are is out there because they weren't withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12699)|
| 3:31:45| And these are going to be on the agenda for April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12705)|
| 3:31:50| And unless somebody wants to do something with them, I think it would be best that we withdraw those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12710)|
| 3:31:55| because no permits of any sort can be issued until these things are off the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12715)|
| 3:31:59| And then I'll let Commissioner Anders, if he doesn't mind, speak as to what the intentions are with his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12719)|
| 3:32:05| Well, my framework was obviously there to do the cap and trade with digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12725)|
| 3:32:10| and obviously digital is out of the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12730)|
| 3:32:12| And so I would like for us to --I guess my only concern now is I don't want to ban new billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12732)|
| 3:32:23| but I would like to check our EMC regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12743)|
| 3:32:27| I don't want to ban EMCs either, but I'd like to look at the regulations and see if we're --and I don't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12747)|
| 3:32:33| I guess Daniel could get with me this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| I'd really like to just look at EMCs and make sure that they're somewhat calmed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| You know, I guess that if we still have the actual ordinances that are out there, they can't issue any permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12761)|
| 3:32:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| And I know people have been asking me what's going on and getting a lot of e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12769)|
| 3:32:55| You know, I think if we wanted to --it's the same thing, actually, with the city of Knoxville has done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12775)|
| 3:33:00| It's where they've regulated the heights of signs, what they look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12780)|
| 3:33:04| They've done the same thing with EMCs, but that's more of a regulation than it is an ordinance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12784)|
| 3:33:10| And we can't win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12790)|
| 3:33:11| Daniel, is there something we can do to get those things pulled tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12791)|
| 3:33:15| Or do you feel more comfortable if we pulled those in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12795)|
| 3:33:18| and just kind of looked at our signed ordinance as far as regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12798)|
| 3:33:22| The approved minutes indicate that those items were deferred by the commission to April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12802)|
| 3:33:28| So they've not been noticed today, and I don't feel very uncomfortable about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12808)|
| 3:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12811)|
| 3:33:32| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12812)|
| 3:33:33| I just wanted to bring that up just so we have a chance to think about it if, you know, if there was something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12813)|
| 3:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12820)|
| 3:33:41| Other things on billboards while it's out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12824)|
| 3:33:45| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| Audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12830)|
| 3:33:51| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12833)|
| 3:33:54| I'm uncertain to what depth we want to go into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12834)|
| 3:33:59| It's been a long day for those of us who started at the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12839)|
| 3:34:04| I did comment last, I think it's at the workshop, about the trustee clearing accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12844)|
| 3:34:11| Pew and Company's report was that the majority of this is working itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12851)|
| 3:34:17| The goal is to have these reconciled monthly, and Mr. Elmore said the process has improved greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12857)|
| 3:34:26| And we were moving forward in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| Commissioner Wright, you put it pretty eloquently about our evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12870)|
| 3:34:36| You want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12876)|
| 3:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12880)|
| 3:34:41| Well, we've got a we're down to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12881)|
| 3:34:44| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12884)|
| 3:34:46| We're down to two candidates to replace Richard, and one of them is Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12886)|
| 3:34:53| I vote for Richard to replace Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12893)|
| 3:34:58| And the other is KPMG, the group that used to be our external auditor and did a great job for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12898)|
| 3:35:07| They're a big international firm, and we will be finalizing that effort May the 5th, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12907)|
| 3:35:18| May the 5th or 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12918)|
| 3:35:21| We had, of course, an open meeting here at 9 o'clock or 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| And lastly, we can't really get into this one in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| I don't know how much commission wants to because we need Hugh Holt here and or Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12929)|
| 3:35:33| and they both had conflicts and had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12933)|
| 3:35:37| Mr. Walls had an electronic, an e-card, you know, what we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12937)|
| 3:35:43| got out of the publicity here five years ago, I guess, or four, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12943)|
| 3:35:48| He did an e-card audit, and he issued 13 opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| And the management agreed with three and disagreed with ten, which is sort of unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12951)|
| 3:35:57| Usually management, if it's 13, they'll disagree with one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12957)|
| 3:36:01| But to some, I don't want to put words in their mouth, but their bottom line rebuttal was, well, the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12961)|
| 3:36:10| the reward is worth the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12970)|
| 3:36:13| And, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but Chris is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| On that particular issue, I believe that Commissioner Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12975)|
| 3:36:20| and I both heard the same things, is it's here are some risks that we're taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12980)|
| 3:36:26| And after discussion, the administration was saying that they were willing to take those risks based on the money saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12986)|
| 3:36:38| So are you suggesting that maybe we bring more of a report about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=12998)|
| 3:36:44| Well, I thought we were going to kick this around today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13004)|
| 3:36:47| And I saw Hugh Holt leave about an hour ago, and he said, I went and chased him down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13007)|
| 3:36:51| He said, I've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13011)|
| 3:36:52| I've got to promise this guy I'll do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| And Chris mentioned 30 minutes ago he had to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13014)|
| 3:36:58| And he said, if you want to get into this in depth, let's do it in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13018)|
| 3:37:03| So what you're saying is it's better to err on the side of caution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13023)|
| 3:37:07| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13027)|
| 3:37:08| And do it in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| Well, let me put this in black-and-white numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13031)|
| 3:37:15| There's some you can find some things where purchases were made which exceeded a limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13035)|
| 3:37:20| or looked like if there's a $5,000 purchase limit, I went and made a $3,000 purchase and a $4,000 purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13040)|
| 3:37:29| And I purchased 7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| I've exceeded the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| But the bottom line position of the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13052)|
| 3:37:37| and the purchasing department is look at what overall happened for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13057)|
| 3:37:42| If you might have seen this picture in the paper, I don't know which paper it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| but some paper from last week, they were rebated $318,000 from SunTrust Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13066)|
| 3:37:52| And this is how all this they can speak to it better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13072)|
| 3:37:57| And the back office savings, according to Hugh Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13077)|
| 3:38:00| approached $2 million for not having purchase orders for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13080)|
| 3:38:05| $1,922,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13085)|
| 3:38:08| And he says he can quantify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13088)|
| 3:38:10| He says that's not just a number he grabbed out of the stars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| that he can quantify saving approaching $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13093)|
| 3:38:17| And to him, he said, I feel our risk is that, yes, somebody could take advantage of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13097)|
| 3:38:22| and maybe get away with fraudulently taking $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13102)|
| 3:38:28| I'm just taking a number out of the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| But look what we saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13111)|
| 3:38:32| We saved approaching $2 million in red tape paperwork, bureaucratic paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13112)|
| 3:38:37| and were rebated $318,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13117)|
| 3:38:40| Hugh can speak to that better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13120)|
| 3:38:42| And, Richard, do you want to comment on it in any capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13122)|
| 3:38:46| I mean, Richard, you're the one who brought it to our attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13126)|
| 3:38:48| and I think that's what an auditor should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| That's their purpose and role in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| And it's good that he brought it to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| But the administration said, well, it's worth the reward, outweighs the risk by about 20 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13135)|
| 3:39:12| It's not working, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13152)|
| 3:39:16| Front and center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13156)|
| 3:39:27| Name and address, Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| Richard Walls, Knox County Auditor, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| No, Ed did a good job of, I think, summarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| You know, even though we have, you know, audit evidence that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13178)|
| 3:39:41| there were departures from the policies and procedures which you would expect that would be adhered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13181)|
| 3:39:51| we understand that, you know, the risk and the reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13191)|
| 3:39:56| It's our job to point out the risk and any departures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13196)|
| 3:40:02| And I understand the difference between risk and reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13202)|
| 3:40:05| And actually, as I told the audit committee, I didn't have any heartburn at all with them disagreeing with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13205)|
| 3:40:13| because I felt like I've done my job pointing out the risk and the departures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13213)|
| 3:40:20| And, you know, if management chooses to, I was going to use the word ignore, but I don't think that's proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13220)|
| 3:40:30| except the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13230)|
| 3:40:33| You know, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| You know, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13235)|
| 3:40:39| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13239)|
| 3:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13240)|
| 3:40:41| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13241)|
| 3:40:42| Yes, I do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13242)|
| 3:40:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13243)|
| 3:40:44| I'm assuming that each department head reviews these things on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13244)|
| 3:40:53| I mean, it could, here again, just a matter of housekeeping to say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13253)|
| 3:40:58| you know, particularly the one about the mulch where the guy went two different times to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13258)|
| 3:41:03| You know, it's hard to plan how much you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| Maybe you don't have enough room on the truck to haul it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| But if the department head at the end of the month had stuck those two together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13269)|
| 3:41:14| and, you know, written two sentences of explanation, it would all have been, you know, cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13274)|
| 3:41:23| I mean, it sounded like you all, in one of the e-mails we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| it sounded like you all were having a battle back and forth, but I know it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13286)|
| 3:41:29| But you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13289)|
| 3:41:32| That's what you're there for, to look at these things and point them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13292)|
| 3:41:36| It just makes everybody, it keeps everybody honest, not that we're saying they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13296)|
| 3:41:40| but, I mean, I think it's good to have some checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13300)|
| 3:41:45| And that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13305)|
| 3:41:46| We didn't, you know, even though we found departures from the policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13306)|
| 3:41:52| we really didn't find any purchases that were illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13312)|
| 3:41:58| And so, I mean, there were perfectly good purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| The ones referenced in the e-mail just avoided the particular person's e-card limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13321)|
| 3:42:10| And just like the example Ed gave, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13330)|
| 3:42:14| they made two purchases back-to-back that exceeded their single transaction limit, which did, you know, depart from the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13334)|
| 3:42:26| But, again, the purchases, they were okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13346)|
| 3:42:29| It just went over their limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13349)|
| 3:42:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13354)|
| 3:42:35| Well, I just kind of wanted to expound on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13355)|
| 3:42:38| And I think we're insinuating that there was a policy violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13358)|
| 3:42:43| That person, it was a two-day difference in the purchase of the mulch, and it was, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13363)|
| 3:42:49| Actually, there wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| That was the dates that the transactions were charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| They were actually back-to-back invoice numbers and back-to-back days on the one you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13377)|
| 3:43:04| But it appears now that if you looked at the transactions that showed up on the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13384)|
| 3:43:10| they were a couple of days apart, but the purchases were actually back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13390)|
| 3:43:15| That same day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13395)|
| 3:43:16| No, it was actually one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13396)|
| 3:43:18| And then apparently there wasn't any more business because the invoice numbers were actually consecutive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13398)|
| 3:43:28| But, I mean, they could use one invoice pad for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| I mean, that could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| Well, but this particular business was not even in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13412)|
| 3:43:36| It was like a hundred and some miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| I mean, but the transactions were two days apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13418)|
| 3:43:44| At no time did they exceed their single limit transaction or did they exceed their money transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13424)|
| 3:43:49| No, let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| Okay, they weren't two days apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| That's what I was trying to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13432)|
| 3:43:53| Two transactions that were looked at by six people through the approval process after the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13433)|
| 3:44:00| And so I just don't want people to think that there's this shady dealings going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13440)|
| 3:44:05| No, and I'm not saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| If you'll let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13447)|
| 3:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13448)|
| 3:44:11| Because, you know, every transaction is approved by the next supervisor, the next department supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13451)|
| 3:44:17| the department head goes through three eyes in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13457)|
| 3:44:20| And so I don't want people leaving this meeting thinking there was shady dealings going on because we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13460)|
| 3:44:26| But I just want to make that those things were explained, and I thought they were explained well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13466)|
| 3:44:35| I was a little disappointed in the e-mail exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| I think that if you find it in discretion, and I'm not a professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13478)|
| 3:44:42| but if you as an auditor find something that's wrong and give management time to explain it before it kind of goes public and viral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13482)|
| 3:44:49| It went viral unnecessarily toward commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13489)|
| 3:44:53| And I don't know how we got the e-mails, but I just wished it would have been handled in a different manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13493)|
| 3:45:00| I don't want anybody walking away from this meeting thinking that somebody in, I think it's Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13500)|
| 3:45:05| violated policy because they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13505)|
| 3:45:07| Well, no, actually they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| You can't exceed the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13510)|
| 3:45:14| And that was the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13514)|
| 3:45:15| That's our finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13515)|
| 3:45:18| The transactions were back-to-back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13518)|
| 3:45:22| The two days you were talking about were actually when they actually charged it to the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13522)|
| 3:45:30| If you look at the invoice dates and the invoice numbers, you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13530)|
| 3:45:34| And, again, I'm not, again, those weren't illegal purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| They just more or less went around the single transaction limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13538)|
| 3:45:44| And that's the only point we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13544)|
| 3:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13548)|
| 3:45:49| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13549)|
| 3:45:50| Just to pull that string.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| So if they made both purchases under one invoice, they would have been over their limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13552)|
| 3:45:59| and abilities with that e-card that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13559)|
| 3:46:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| So, you know, if that is the case, I mean, that's split purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13564)|
| 3:46:12| I mean, so there's nothing really, like I said, nothing illegal about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13572)|
| 3:46:15| The stuff went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13575)|
| 3:46:16| It didn't go to anyone's yard or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13576)|
| 3:46:18| I mean, it was used properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13578)|
| 3:46:20| But, you know, from an accounting and an audit standpoint, that's kind of what split purchasing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13580)|
| 3:46:29| So, you know, hopefully they'll correct the behavior or, you know, maybe try to, you know, correct the anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13589)|
| 3:46:40| Let me call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13600)|
| 3:46:41| But, you know, I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13601)|
| 3:46:42| I don't think anyone said anything egregious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| We're not pointing the finger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13605)|
| 3:46:46| But that's what audits do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13606)|
| 3:46:47| Audits have findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| You know, no one's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13609)|
| 3:46:50| No system's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13610)|
| 3:46:52| Our e-card system works, and it works well, and it gives us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13612)|
| 3:46:57| But there's always some nicks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13617)|
| 3:47:00| So I do think that, you know, this particular one seemed to be, as I read through the e-mails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13620)|
| 3:47:06| and there were a lot, but it seemed to be, you know, judgmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13626)|
| 3:47:13| But if you really looked at it, I mean, any one single transaction shouldn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13633)|
| 3:47:17| And when you have back-to-back like that, you know, it does seem to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13637)|
| 3:47:22| it seemed like it was split purchasing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13642)|
| 3:47:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13646)|
| 3:47:27| Thank you, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13647)|
| 3:47:28| And we hope this serves us to amend policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13648)|
| 3:47:33| And I think that's something they're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13655)|
| 3:47:36| So I don't think there was any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13656)|
| 3:47:38| We're not crying foul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13658)|
| 3:47:40| So if that policy gets amended, then government works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13660)|
| 3:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13665)|
| 3:47:46| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13666)|
| 3:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13667)|
| 3:47:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13668)|
| 3:47:52| Discussion regarding the dates for the budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13672)|
| 3:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13676)|
| 3:47:57| The dates that we were given for hearings were we had a problem on May 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13677)|
| 3:48:05| with this room being occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13685)|
| 3:48:10| They said that the small assembly was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13690)|
| 3:48:13| We had May 20th, a half day open in here, May 23rd, a half day open in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13693)|
| 3:48:21| and May 24th, all day open in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13701)|
| 3:48:24| Do we have a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13704)|
| 3:48:28| I hear a 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13708)|
| 3:48:30| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13710)|
| 3:48:33| That 24th is a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| It's a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13715)|
| 3:48:38| It's all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13718)|
| 3:48:39| It's available all day on that Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13719)|
| 3:48:42| That seems okay because don't we have the work session on the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13722)|
| 3:48:47| Yeah, so we won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| If we have it on the 24th, can we have it in the afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13730)|
| 3:48:52| I'm going to be out of town and I can leave early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13732)|
| 3:48:55| I'm going to be out of town from the 20th to the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13735)|
| 3:48:58| If we could have it later in the afternoon or after lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13738)|
| 3:49:01| I know you guys don't want to be here after too long, but I'll be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13741)|
| 3:49:05| I can drive back early if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13745)|
| 3:49:09| I'm in a town on the 23rd and 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13749)|
| 3:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13758)|
| 3:49:19| Half day on the 22nd, was that right, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| 22nd, we don't have it except for in the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13761)|
| 3:49:27| We can have it in the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| I don't really see that big of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13770)|
| 3:49:32| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13772)|
| 3:49:33| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13773)|
| 3:49:34| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13774)|
| 3:49:35| I hate to ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| Can we move to the 29th, the next Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| Well, I didn't check that with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13780)|
| 3:49:43| Chris had these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13783)|
| 3:49:44| He gave these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13784)|
| 3:49:47| Is the 22nd bad for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13787)|
| 3:49:49| I'll be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13789)|
| 3:49:50| You're gone that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13790)|
| 3:49:53| Larry's gone on the 23rd and 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13793)|
| 3:49:56| Yeah, that 29th works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| Is that too close to the budget vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13798)|
| 3:50:01| What is it, a week out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13801)|
| 3:50:02| The 6th is the vote, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13802)|
| 3:50:05| June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13805)|
| 3:50:06| That's eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13806)|
| 3:50:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13807)|
| 3:50:08| Well, why don't we tentatively set it for the 29th, and then I'll get with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13813)|
| 3:50:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13814)|
| 3:50:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13815)|
| 3:50:16| We'll start early, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13816)|
| 3:50:18| Is that what we did before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13818)|
| 3:50:19| 9 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13819)|

| 3:50:24| 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13824)|
| 3:50:26| What are you laughing about, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13826)|
| 3:50:28| That's the day after our regular commission meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13828)|
| 3:50:31| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13831)|
| 3:50:32| The day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13832)|
| 3:50:33| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13833)|
| 3:50:34| One day is the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13834)|
| 3:50:35| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13835)|
| 3:50:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13836)|
| 3:50:37| We'll have all the commission, pension, et cetera, on the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13837)|
| 3:50:40| and then the 29th is this, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13840)|
| 3:50:43| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13843)|
| 3:50:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13844)|
| 3:50:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13847)|
| 3:50:48| I'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13848)|
| 3:50:49| From 9 a.m. to when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13849)|
| 3:50:50| 9 until dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13850)|
| 3:50:53| 9 until 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13853)|
| 3:51:04| Tentatively the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13864)|
| 3:51:10| June 6th is the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| D-Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13872)|

| 3:51:17| 9 a.m. on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13877)|
| 3:51:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13883)|
| 3:51:24| He'll set that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13884)|
| 3:51:26| I am looking down the road a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13886)|
| 3:51:29| but in July we've got five Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13889)|
| 3:51:33| And the last time we had five Mondays, we were meeting last Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13893)|
| 3:51:48| You want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13908)|
| 3:51:49| We'll talk about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| That's a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| We may be dead before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13914)|
| 3:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13920)|
| 3:52:01| We've got to spread a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13921)|
| 3:52:04| On page 12, spread a record of the Knox County Mayor's appointment of Bobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13924)|
| 3:52:07| Christenberry to the Knox County Personnel Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| Ms. Christenberry is serving the unexpired term of 20 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13929)|
| 3:52:13| which term expires December 20, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13933)|
| 3:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13936)|
| 3:52:17| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13937)|
| 3:52:18| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13938)|
| 3:52:20| Discussion regarding the Neighborhood Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13940)|
| 3:52:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13943)|
| 3:52:24| Neighborhood Conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13944)|
| 3:52:25| That was if it was before 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13945)|
| 3:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13950)|
| 3:52:31| You want to say something, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13951)|
| 3:52:33| Just real quick, I mean, they had a great conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13953)|
| 3:52:36| We were in a breakout session at 1030 and had about, I don't know, 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13956)|
| 3:52:40| 20 people in the room and just bounced some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13960)|
| 3:52:43| gave a little history of who we are and where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13963)|
| 3:52:46| And I think it's going to be an annual event through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| and I think we should participate as a county every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13968)|
| 3:52:53| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13973)|
| 3:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13974)|
| 3:52:55| Thanks for covering again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13975)|
| 3:52:56| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13976)|
| 3:52:58| Go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130325?start=13978)|
