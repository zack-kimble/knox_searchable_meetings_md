| 0:07:25| Ricky Hall died this past weekend after a really gallant struggle with brain cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| He was much too young. He was a dedicated environmental and political activist, a writer, and a journalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| A lot of you read him in Metropulse and in the Hellbender Press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| He was a good friend to me and really one of the smartest people I've ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| I appreciate Ricky for all of his support and enthusiasm in my own political campaigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| and I know he helped a lot of other candidates who ran for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| And I thank him more broadly for everything his advocacy and intelligence contributed to our community over the last several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=475)|
| 0:08:03| Even when I disagreed with him, I always wanted to know what Ricky thought and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| So I attended a tribute concert for him a few weeks ago at the Scruffy City Hall on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| I saw a councilman camping there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| And the outpouring of love and respect for him from people across Knoxville is really quite touching and inspiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| So I'll miss Ricky. I know a lot of us will miss Ricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| And our hearts go out to his wife, Kim, and all of his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| So thank you for letting me share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| And now are there any reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=515)|

| 0:14:54| that we're doing before turnover to the actual builder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=894)|

| 0:15:22| thought we were on the last step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| we pulled out some concrete pads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| and there was this stuff under them. So it had to be remediated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=930)|

| 0:15:38| And let me just add to that, Councilman Della Vapi, we did all of the environmental work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| that we could do before we started the project. Unfortunately this particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| was underneath the building so it was impossible to know until we started taking the building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=946)|

| 0:26:36| it will coincide with the garage construction as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1596)|

| 0:30:40| But we've done 42 total in the city now since we've started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| the nuisance abatement process. And those are conducted by our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| repeat offender squad and our organized crime unit in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| the DA's office as well as other units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| that are engaged, patrol and our neighborhood bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| The grant that we are applying for, or the foundation grant that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| applying for is an opportunity to hopefully provide some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| money for supplies and overtime to continue those operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| And the operations certainly are making an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| And we've seen that in terms of the decrease in crime, not only in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| but overall in our city. And so it's had a very positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| impact on our city by shutting down these, basically the worst of the worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| properties that are havens for criminal activity in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And those are the kind of places everyone says, well, is that place down the street? But we never could do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| And now we have this program that's really helpful, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| And very impactful in engaging neighbors as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| as being able to address the root cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| of the issues in our neighborhoods. How did MetLife get in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| MetLife is just another founding or funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| cooperative. They're looking for local initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| that basically are homegrown in terms of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| assistance. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| as they go to hand money out, we look for places that are handing money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| That's great. Thank you. Yes, sir. We've got a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| set of grant writers there in the police department. Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| Mayor? Yes, Councilman Graves. I would just like to say to the Chief, I really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| the fact that two nuisance businesses in the Bearden area were shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| And I'm sure that all the neighbors and all of us really appreciate the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| you folks have done on that. So thank you very much. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Okay, we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. Resolution 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| AB, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Daniel Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| Danco Inc. for the amount of $319,800 to construct a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| public restroom pavilion at Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Councilman Wallace. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| continue to plug, you know, $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| I think it's a good project. I just want to continue to plug the idea that we ought to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| master plan and decide what we want to do with Chihuly Park. We spent money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| last year out there over a million dollars, I think, on the renovation of that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| now $300,000. And I'd like to see us have a master plan and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| what's the highest and best use of that property. Thank you. And Ms. Branscom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Yeah, if I can address that. As you and I have talked, we're going to do a feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| on the auditorium coliseum first. So as soon as we get that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| finished and we understand what that feasibility study lays out for us and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| make some decisions based on that study, then we'll turn our attention to Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| But these are improvements that have needed to happen at the park for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| But we do know it needs to be evaluated on a broader scale and we will be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you. Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Oh, Councilman Dallavope. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| I don't know whether this is for Greg McKay or for Christy, but tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| about our $346,000 potty. I realize it's more than that. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| picnic shelter area and a mechanical room, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| seemed a little gold-plated. I'm sure it's very needed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| We have large crowds that come to some of the car shows and the other shows out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| and obviously they have to have a place to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| natural relief. It is very needed. It is very used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| not only by the people who use Chihuly Park, but also by the neighborhood community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| They use it quite a bit. But Greg McKay is here, and he can come down and give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| some details on the project. Maybe he can give us a breakout or something, Greg, if you can get down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| here, just what we're doing. Mayor, while he's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| could I make a brief comment? Right ahead. I have had several people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| who walk in the park to talk with me about the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| restroom facilities, and I know that a lot of people are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| very happy to have that because a lot of people use that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Thank you. Mr. McKay. Greg McKay. I'm the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| of public assembly facilities for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Yes, it is. It's more than just a bathroom. It's actually 13 bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| There's seven women and six men. We do believe in parity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| It's over 3,000 square feet. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| It also includes a picnic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| It is much needed. There are a lot of people in the evening that use the park from the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| walk their dogs. Also, during the fair and during our events, we've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| had permanent bathrooms on the site except in the Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| This was actually planned before I got there, but I think it's a needed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| So we're just bringing in, like, porta-potties for events? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| We have been for years. And this will help alleviate some of that. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| the fair will still require porta-potties, and some of our larger events will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| When do you think this will all be in place? Labor Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered. 11AC is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to propose to partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| with the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance and receive a grant of up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| $700,000 from the Department of Energy to support an energy efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| financing program. So moved. Second. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| 12A is an ordinance to repeal the operation of Knoxville City Code Sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| 2-454, 456, 458, and 459| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| to the extent and as they respectively relate to the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| salary increase of 2.5% for employees with salaries in excess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| of $40,000, requested by Councilmember Dela Volpe. Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Second. Okay, Councilmember Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Yeah, let me address this, because first off, I think there's some confusion about what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| is, but I want to make sure we all understand what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Somewhere back in 1981, this 2.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| increase was adopted by the city when Mayor Tyree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| was in office. It was, if those of you who are old enough remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| the oil embargo, interest rates went through the roof. I happen to have bought my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| house somewhere in that time frame and paid way too much interest and was glad to refinance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| But we were running around average 9%. There were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| years where it was 13%. And there was a lot of pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| on the salary, what, schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| in terms of where employees would be on it and how they would move through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| And they passed both some salary increases and this 2.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| increase to deal with just the rampant inflation at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| Here it is 30 years later, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| inflation, of course, it may go up again, but inflation has been relatively tame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| for the last couple of years, under, by average, 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| in the last five or six years, maybe a percent and a half, according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| the federal CPI. And it struck me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| this is a highly unusual, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| rule that we have in our ordinances at a time when it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| quite fit the same economic circumstances. I don't see any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| reason why the city administration shouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| discretion to be flexible to look at everything, the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| the inflation, where the salary schedules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| reviews have been, and look at what kinds of increases can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| given. You have to understand the 2.5% was a floor. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| not a ceiling. And back then you could give more than 2.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| and you can now. And all I am suggesting, as the AIS tells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| you, is that we should leave that discretionary view to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| the administration that has access to all the financial information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| We're looking at budget items now where we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| any real growth in sales tax and property tax, which is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| 80% of the income that this city receives, or revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| So I'm suggesting take it off automatic pilot, put the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| of the administration to evaluate it, and let them make the increases where they make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| sense. Now there is a piece that has become more controversial if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| it's possible than that, and that is why did I pick the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| $40,000 rate to say those over that would have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| adjustment done discretionary and flexibly and not under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| You know, at the time I was trying to find the midpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| and I went and talked to Vicki Hatfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| who runs those statistics for us, and somewhere between 40 and 45%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| is the 50% range of employee salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| So I picked that saying, well, the folks that are under 40 in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| that I selected, you know, probably need to know that we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| at least as we try this out and see how it works, we're going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| sort of that floor in place. But realistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| I think this should be evaluated like every single thing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| administration has to do. We had two and a half days of hearings recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| where we were looking at things like do we close a fire station, do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| take 16 police officers out of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| There's a lot of things being looked at in terms of how do we manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| the cost that we have with the budget we have. And I submit that having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| an artificial two and a half percent in the statute makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| no sense. It ought to be evaluated on economic terms and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| fair terms that I'm sure the administration could look at with input from the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| So I'm suggesting that we repeal, and the reason there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| four sections, some of them dealt with general employees, some dealt with fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| some dealt with police. But it's the same provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| it's the same idea. It has an automatic salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| I think that was done at a time when they were putting oil on the water to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| quell what was a great deal of unrest because the salary system was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| out of whack. We have studies going on periodically. Right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| we have a consultant looking at this stuff and trying to make our schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| fairer, trying to make step raises make more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| I don't think this should be on automatic pilot, and I'm suggesting that we give the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| full discretion to evaluate the economic circumstances and propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| increases for employees, whether it's, you know, anywhere from zero to 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| There's no sense in making it artificial. That's why I introduced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| I think it gives some relief to the budget review process, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| that's really what I wanted to say. Thank you. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Yes, thank you. Well, I agree with most of that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| I'm in no way trying to undermine having the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| employees and retaining and recruiting the best employees and paying them the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| And I voted for the wage study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| and I would vote for that again. I think that's the right thing to do and to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| we're paying the market value and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| to keep the best employees. That's simple as put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| But I think this is a decision that rests with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| the mayor. And I think it rests with any CEO. It rests with any boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| It's the boss's, the owner's, the CEO's decision on how to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| salary increases and where those go and how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| because it all ties into funding. So I'm in no way trying to undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| pay as much as I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| the authority for this rests back with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| And I think you said that well. The part I don't agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| Councilman Della Vopi, is that I would like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| to say that we appeal at all and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| take out the steps. And so I make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| repeal the entire coordinates, the two and a half percent increase above the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and let the administration have this and let them take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| salary increases as they may and as it can fit in any budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| And if it's two and a half percent, if it's ten and a half percent, whatever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| in my opinion, myself as an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| of forty-five employees, it's my decision on how much I want to pay them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| and how much increase I can afford in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| So I'm not opposed to paying them more. That's not what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| It's about getting back the authority, back to the mayor to let her decide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| with her, you know, with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| I will support your. Councilman Della Vopi, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| I was going to tell him I support his substitute motion. Okay. So there's a second for the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| That's fine. Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Well, you know, I've got a little bit different take on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| I appreciate my colleagues' comments. To me, this is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| like the pension. See the same faces. And to me, it is exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| And, you know, you hear you want to compare government to private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| But private enterprise is, you know, a risk-reward business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| And you can do that. You can go out there and do those things with your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| You can be you can take chances. You can reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| You can do whatever because you don't have to answer to anybody unless you're publicly traded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| And then you answer to Wall Street in twelve-week cycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| But government is a service provider. That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| And you look at all the faces out here, and this is what all these folks get up every day to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| is to ensure that the tax dollars that we collect are given back adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| and fairly to the taxpayers of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And that's what we do. We're not for a, you know, a big game for profit enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| And that is why I think it's important for us to continue on with the two-and-a-half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2683)|
| 0:45:07| I would say private enterprise pays better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| They have bonuses, for the most part, and pensions of some sort are, you know, generally given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| So, financially, it's a lot better for individuals at times to be in the private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| So we've got to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| We did the Mercer study, and we saw that we were a little bit behind the bell curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| If we take this two-and-a-half percent away, we're going to get further and further and further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| And we can't afford to do that, because I've said this time and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| and I'm going to continue to say it, our greatest asset are employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| because those are the men and women that get up every day and give the sweat equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| so people feel like that the taxes that they paid are, you know, they're getting their money's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| Turnover, let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| You know, if we don't pay our employees a fair rate, coupled with a pension that we took care of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2759)|
| 0:46:08| which is not exactly probably where a lot of the new hires would like it to be compared to what we had in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| but it's fair and it's adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| And that, based with the, you know, with the salary model that we have, makes a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| People stay here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| I know people have been here 30, 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| We all go to the luncheons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| And it's great to see the people that have served, you know, the public that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| But turnover is our greatest enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| And it's the greatest enemy of any business, because, you know, you lose the teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| You lose the camaraderie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| You lose the pride and all the accomplishments that you've done as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| So turnover is something that we cannot afford to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| And as an example of that, when it cost us, I talked to both chiefs today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| and when a vacant position is filled at KPD, it cost us $66,000 to get that job replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2816)|
| 0:47:05| When we have a new hire, to put them on the street, it's $110,000 investment of hard-earned taxpayer's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2825)|
| 0:47:14| That's one hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| In the fire department, it is approximately $40,000 a year to put a new firefighter on the street equipped and trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2836)|
| 0:47:30| You lose four or five of those people to Maryville, to Y-12, to Oak Ridge, any of the surrounding counties, that is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| That's a lot of money that we're wasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| And so the only way I see that we retain and attract and keep the employees, the good employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| that we've got to have to make this city efficient is to have a fair wage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| and nobody has to get, you know, rich, that rich off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| but make a fair wage with a good pension, and you know you've got a future ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| So, for those reasons, I'm not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2886)|
| 0:48:26| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| I've heard for the four years, five years I've been on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| this topic has been kicked around by a previous council, and now it's being kicked around by this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| And I'm disturbed that we have nothing in place to replace this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| If we remove the 2.5% pay raise, we don't have anything in place to cover increases in the cost of living, to provide incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2925)|
| 0:48:54| We don't have performance-based pay mechanisms ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| And until we have those things, I don't think that we need to be repealing the ordinances that grant this 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2940)|
| 0:49:08| If there are other ways that employees can receive pay raises, those need to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| But we're right in the middle of another study on looking at the salaries of all the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| and I think we need to get that completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| And then if we decide with the employee groups that we need to look at some other ways to provide raises, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2963)|
| 0:49:34| But I think that this is the very wrong time to do this, and I certainly won't be supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2974)|
| 0:49:51| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| I'm very uncomfortable with the timing on this, just like Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| We are right in the midst of the salary survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| and there's so many other factors in my mind that go into this budgetary process, and we're in the midst of talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3005)|
| 0:50:13| I am not ready to support this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3013)|
| 0:50:25| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| I understand what my colleagues are saying, but I also feel very strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| and maybe philosophically in terms of what Councilman Wallace has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| that I really think there are a number of ways in which employees can be compensated for the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| And I do believe that under the circumstances with what I've been reading about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| and what I understand with what's going on with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| and the possibility of tax increases or the reduction in services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| I really do think that the mayor ought to have the option of being able to look at everything and not have your hands tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| The other thing that I think that all of us are missing is that who's up here representing the taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| Who up here is representing the little folks that are not little folks, but older folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| retirees that are living on fixed incomes in houses within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| I think we need to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| And let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| We're in a situation today with the economy the way it is that all of us are being hit one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And we all need to share in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| We need to share in the burden in terms of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| And if it means that some of us need to take less pay for whatever the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| or that we can't get a base or we can't get a pay raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| maybe what we have to do is see what's going to happen next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| But I really think that, Mayor, philosophically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| I'd really like to see you be the one responsible for the staff that you do oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| and take care of those pay raises, whether it's through bonuses or whether it's through standard pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| So I will be supporting the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| We're going back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Mayor Brown, I don't think you've spoken to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| I had not planned to really address this other than to just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| But I will say that I spent my life as a working person punching a clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| and I realized the value of these increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| There's really not that much to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| And at $40,000, there's not a lot of money today to try to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| So I understand my colleagues' thinking of trying to put the city in a found physical condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3152)|
| 0:52:40| but it's not always about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| We are dealing with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And I know that no one is being mean-spirited in this, but as for myself, I just cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3172)|
| 0:53:03| I'll go back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Actually, I also want to tell you, we have four people who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Do you want to hear from them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I mean, typically our rules allow three, so the first thing I'm asking is when do you want to hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| and do they need to choose three out of the four, or are you willing to listen to all four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| We'll listen to all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Would you like to hear them now, or do you want to have some more discussion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| I think for continuity, I mean, we've been with the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| Personally, I would like to see a state with the council discussion since we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| Council discussion going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| I mean, that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Is everybody fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Then later we'll have the folks who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Well, I want to just, you know, rebuttal that, because this is not about, and Councilman Pavlis is taking it totally out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| This is not about trying to push somebody down and trying to strip somebody's income away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| This is not what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| It's about, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| It's not about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| It's about the giving the authority back to the mayor to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| I'm for two and a half percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| But I'm not for the automatic part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| That's a decision you make each year based on what your economics are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| And that's what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| That's what the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| It's not just in private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| It's what the state just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| And that was based on the revenues for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| That was his decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| And that's what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| And it's not about trying to push somebody down or take something away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| It's not about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| You have to pay for the best employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| You have to retain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| It does cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| You have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I understand that wholeheartedly because I write payroll checks every other week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| But I'm just saying that it's not automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| I've got to look at each year, and it's no different in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and it's no different in private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Yeah, I just wanted to footnote, and I'll join George in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| It seems to me that when you translate what Mr. Pavlis is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| it's as if we're taking something away from the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| But I think, no, I think we're putting flexibility into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| And I guess I could translate his remarks into he doesn't trust the mayor to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| And I don't believe that that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| This is a 30-year-old provision that was put in at a time when inflation was going through the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3322)|
| 0:55:29| It ought to be looked at with all the facts in front of you and make a rational decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| There's nothing wrong with getting a raise, but it ought to be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| just like we look at how many cars we're going to buy and how many employees we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| or whether we're going to lay somebody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It has to be looked at in a discretionary fashion that takes all the factors into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| And putting your thumb on the scale isn't prudent, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| Okay, I'm going to ask everyone to stay calm, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Let's have the discussion, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Well, I mean, I'm not taking anything out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| I mean, I've run a small family business myself with, you know, up to 30, 35 employees for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| I've worked for two Fortune 500 companies in the last 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| I mean, I know what it's like to earn a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| And it is taken away from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| I mean, I don't understand when you say we're not taking away from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| We're taking away a guarantee that they know that they can count on, they can put their kids in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| they can buy a car, they can buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| They know they can plan their lives based on that 2.5 percent and the salaries that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| So I'm not taking anything out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| And I certainly have all the trust and faith in the mayor and her administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| and this council to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| So, I mean, when you look at the increase, the percentage of increase that we're talking about here with this 2.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| it's less than a half a percent of the total operating budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| So look out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Are they worth that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| I think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| And this is an emotional issue, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3421)|
| 0:57:13| Council, let's keep this at a professional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Let's keep it at a, you know, I don't think we need to be pointing fingers at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| And, you know, we won't get very far that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| I promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| This is a difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| And I, you know, agree with a lot of what's been said on both sides of it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| You know, and I think it's been brought up because we are facing a tough budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| My third budget, and I think we know it's a very tough budget given a lot of the expenses that have increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3465)|
| 0:57:54| And I think that's why it's come up at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| And that's why there's tension amongst the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| And I think that's why it's being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| But I think it's premature at this point to be looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| I think it should be looked at in the context of the entire budget, not just tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| And I think it's important to remember, you know, and I certainly think if we can afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| we should continue on with it, but to look at it in the context of the entire budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| And also remember it has been around over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| And I think the studies have shown that, you know, our employees aren't overpaid and many times underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| So, you know, given the timing, like Councilman Saunders said, I'm not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| But I do think that, you know, when we're talking about cutting positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| it certainly makes sense that not having raises would be considered at the same time when you're trying to make those choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| But in terms of being able to support this tonight, I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3538)|
| 0:59:09| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| I just want to say again that this is always a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| It's always a tough situation when you're dealing with someone's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| But I think also that the one thing that I would hope that as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and I think that our council is one that does talk to one another and not privately at council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3563)|
| 0:59:32| I better throw that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I got in trouble once before for saying it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| But I think that one of the things that we need to understand is that it's our responsibility as the council to be fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| for decisions that we make and what we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| And it's not a matter of, Nick, what you're saying or George is what he's saying or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| I think we're all coming from this, from the idea that we are concerned about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| We are concerned about where we are money-wise as far as revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| We saw the headlines of the paper this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| We saw what the state has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| We've seen what the governors had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| And I think what we're looking at is that I would hope that all of us would also consider the taxpayer in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3606)|
| 1:00:14| They're the ones that are footing the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| And we need to make sure that we're representing them as well as all our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| And the other thing I want to say is just because we may not agree with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| or may not agree with whether or not the employees should have a pay increase or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| it doesn't mean that we don't think they're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| We do think they're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| But it's something that no, it's not funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| I mean, I'm being serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| We have a responsibility as an elected official to look at the overall budget in terms of where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| and what we can do and whether or not we can provide the services that our taxpayers want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| And our taxpayers are the ones that are footing the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| And we need to consider that as we look at each one of the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And as I said earlier, philosophically, I just feel very strongly that the mayor is one that can make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3659)|
| 1:01:06| And just because we repeal that, it doesn't mean that those pay raises won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| But, again, I think that each one of us are looking at this in different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| and I think that's one of the things that makes us a strong council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| I would just like to say something here since a lot of you have talked about what the mayor's authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| the mayor should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Let me just speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| And I do respect all of the arguments that have been stated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| I think I understand all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| And as I often say, reasonable people can disagree on the issues that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| Right now, as has been mentioned, this 2.5% has been in place for 31 or more years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3703)|
| 1:01:52| We still find ourselves needing to go out and do competitive wage studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| And just went through when Mayor Haslam did the Mercer study a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| we had to spend, was it $6, $7 million or so to try and get us over a three-year period to get us back to the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3722)|
| 1:02:11| And so if we were facing a situation where we had highly overpaid employees, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3731)|
| 1:02:22| in comparison to other cities, then we might have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| I'd have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| You know, then I think we're not perhaps reflecting or balancing the taxpayer needs versus our employees' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3748)|
| 1:02:37| But we're not at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| What we have found is that over these years, we are still, even with this 2.5% base, we are still trying to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3758)|
| 1:02:45| And so we still have to make, I know, adjustments in fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| We know there are some issues in fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| And we're waiting to find out with this most recent study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| It's a commitment that was made by a previous administration, which I intend to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| which is that our goal is to stay competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| As Vice Mayor Pavlis said, we do invest a lot of money in training, preparing our fire department employees, our police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3781)|
| 1:03:11| And we want to make sure that when we do that, that we keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| And we do that by paying them good wages, good benefits competitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| And we ask a lot of them, and therefore we should reflect that in their compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| And our other employees the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| We invest in them through training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| And experience really does matter in the kinds of work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| So though I appreciate the, you know, you wanting to give me the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| I would tell you that I would still be making this type of, given the budget situation right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| I would still make this kind of a 2.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Because we're not at a place yet where this is unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| And so COLAs have actually, if you look at the COLA average over these 31 years, it's more than the 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| And so we're not at a crisis where we need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| We even went through the recession when other places were not giving salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| We were able to continue it because, first of all, our employees really tightened, you know, up on the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| They really excelled in their work, and we were able to continue providing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| and not have to cut salaries and such in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| So I think we're all looking out for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| I know I'm looking out for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| I prepare the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| But I think in looking out for the taxpayer, you also make sure that you're looking out for the city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| because they're the ones who are going to be delivering the services that we depend on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| So I am not asking for this authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| I'm not asking for you to change what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| If it gets to a point in the future where it's unreasonable, then I would go to the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3895)|
| 1:05:01| I'd sit them down and talk to them about it and say, what are we going to do about this because we're getting out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| But we're not to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| And so I would ask that you not support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3913)|
| 1:05:35| Can we hear from the speakers now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Would you like to hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| We have two speakers up in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Kevin Faddis, Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| Welcome back, Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Our retiree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Brian Moran and Frederick Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Mr. Faddis, and let me get my you all know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| I'll set the timer for up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| I want to lighten the mood a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| It's my wife's birthday today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| I'm sorry we've got to spend it here, honey, but happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3968)|
| 1:06:18| Now, first off, I want to thank you, Mayor, Vice Mayor Pavlis, Councilman Brown, Councilwoman Brenda Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| Councilman Saunders, and Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| I want to thank you all, but thank you all for what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| We keep talking about the 2.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| I handed out some handouts earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| Those were for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| The 2.5 we've been getting since 1981 is actually, if you average all that up, it's actually low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4005)|
| 1:06:54| Actually, it's 3.25 is what it averages out to be on the inflation rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4014)|
| 1:07:04| Some of the ñI know Councilman Grieve asked, you know, who's representing the little man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| I'm one of the little men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| These guys are some of the little men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| I'm trying to represent them the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| And I thank you all for as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| And I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| Now, the USA Today says that there's going to be a 3.5 percent raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| You know, that's pretty much the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| You know, we're not looking to break the bank, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| You know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| We know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| We're looking for fair and equitable pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| We're looking to retire with dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Nothing more, nothing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| I can assure you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| We do our jobs very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| We're the cornerstone of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| We build this city with your help, of course, with your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| You know, it's a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Talking about taking things away, it kind of is taking away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| We're not guaranteeing anything in life except death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| You know, that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| But this is something that we've been struggling with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| I know the mayor mentioned, and I hate bringing it up, the past administration, the Mercer Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| It didn't go all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| You know, we were trying to get to midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| I think the last year, my words are it was broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| The answer I got was it wasn't broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| It wasn't implemented the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| So, yeah, I'm looking forward to this new salary survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| and I'm looking forward to working with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| I enjoy good debate, and like I said, I'm not looking to break the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| I'm looking to help the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| That's what I'm hoping to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| I certainly appreciate it, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| Anita Cash, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| I'm back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| It's like old times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| Anita Cash, city of Knoxville retiree, 160 Bird Road, Little City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| And I love retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Anybody else that can, you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| I'm here tonight because, first off, I want all the city employees to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| If you're here as a city employee or a spouse or a child, stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| And if you've been here since 1981, keep standing and anybody else sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4172)|
| 1:09:43| Few and far between, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Well, I really came tonight because when I read in the paper that this 2.5 percent ordinance was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4187)|
| 1:09:55| because of the Arab oil embargo, I wasn't sure what planet I was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| What really happened was what you all have proposed to do and give the authority back to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| to dish out ever how much that mayor at that time decided we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| And every year we were browbeating our heads against the wall trying to get a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| And finally, finally, police and fire got it first on an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| and we got it effective the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| And that 2.5 percent was so that we wouldn't have to run up here every time the cost of living went sky high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4232)|
| 1:10:42| and beg and beg and beg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| That's why the 2.5 percent was approved and implemented to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| If you look back at the documents that are attached to one of those ordinances in 1981,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| it talks about Mayor Tyree gave 13 percent, 13 percent pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| He gave some nine and then they got the automatic 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| There were people that wound up with 17.5 percent pay raises that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| And the city wasn't in that good a shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| I was fortunate enough to have worked in a number of departments during my employment with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| When I was in fleet management, we couldn't buy a lawnmower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| We had to lease purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| Never will forget all those we had to send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| When I went to inspections, they had clunker cars that wouldn't even pull Walnut Street Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| But the employees still got 2.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| And I understand that people are on a fixed income, but let me tell you something, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| These people are on a fixed income, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| They get the same amount every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| And honestly and truly, I probably don't have a dog in this spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| except that I am tired of people not getting the facts before they start putting stuff out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| and they don't think about the employees that get up every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| work differential shifts to protect and defend and take care of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| That's who those taxpayers are indebted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Not just these people that are up here, not the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| They're indebted to these folks out here that are taking care of their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4348)|
| 1:12:40| And I want to talk just a second about the Mercer Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| When the Mercer Plan was reviewed, put into place, approved and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4363)|
| 1:12:51| your very own vice mayor, Bob Becker, sat on our committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| And I can't tell you how many times he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| but this is just to get them to the 50th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| This is just to get them to the 50th percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| Do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Take care of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| They work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| They work Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, nights, you name it, they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| And they've done it without complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| So take care of the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4408)|
| 1:13:41| Thank you, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Brian Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Brian Moran, 801 East Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| I'm here tonight in behalf of Mark Taylor, representing the Fraternal Order of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| Some of you I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| I've spent some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| I've spent 19 years with this city under a couple of mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| I've spent some time as a local FOP president as well as a state FOP president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| So I've got a little background, as Anita and Kevin do, on things like the Mercer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| and trusting previous mayors to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| I do trust this mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I trust her implicitly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| I can speak from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| When this country was going through the most prosperous economic time in recent history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| we had a mayor, had he had the authority, would have gave us zero many years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| So to say that is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Let me, without going too far into the weeds, touch on this 1.5 percent cost of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| inflation rate, or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| The Bureau of Labor Statistics is where most people get this from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| And I understand cost of living equations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| But let's be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| And everybody on this, Diaz, is smart enough to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| The federal government doesn't include many things in those figures that I would argue most of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| with common sense and any rationalization whatsoever, would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Things like the increase to food, energy cost increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| Those are not included in the inflation rate and cost of living rates compiled that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| And anybody that would think that the increase in food, increase in energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| doesn't affect your cost of living isn't thinking straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| So when you're quoting numbers like 1.5 percent, I would just ask that you please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| if you're going to quote them, let's do an honest cost of living assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| Just because the federal government says they shouldn't be involved doesn't mean they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| In real world situations, I think we can all agree those apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Now, I can't add to what you guys said about the two and a half since 1981| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| and that every credible pay survey since my 19 years of being here that has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| has put us below average, even though we've had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Common sense dictates that this needs to stay in place, not only for those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| but also because it also sends a message to your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| You say it's not taking something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| Sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| You're sending a message to the employees that, hey, there's no more safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| If the mayor doesn't like it, tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| You don't get a pay raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| And you think that's unreasonable, but we went through that in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| And if this wouldn't have been in place, we would have got nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| So I would implore you to vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Support your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Everybody says they do, but actions speak louder than words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4578)|
| 1:16:30| Thank you, Mr. Moran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Again, Frederick Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| Mr. Wagner, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Frederick Wagner, 504 Knox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| I was hoping I wasn't going to have to come here and do this again, but we're back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| I'd like to thank Daniel Brown, Brenda Palmer, Nick Pavlis, Dwayne, I mean, Marshall Stair, Finbar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4610)|
| 1:17:03| It really troubles me because y'all sit up here and you collect a paycheck, and most of y'all don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4623)|
| 1:17:17| You don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| And, I mean, you sit and you run for office and I want to improve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| Well, that ought to be voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| I have employees in public service that make barely enough money to get to and fro from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| To and fro from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| And we're not asking to get rich, but we're asking to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| And, I mean, I thank the councilmen that had the intestinal fortitude to say no to Nick DeLaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4668)|
| 1:17:59| And I just think it's appalling that you think that our 2.5% should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| I mean, I understand that we are supposed to stay in budget and we're supposed to do this and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| but come and work with us a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| Come and beat the streets where we have to litter streets and alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| Come and beat the streets at Cumberland Avenue where employees have to walk up and down Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| get spit on, get beer bottles thrown at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| Come and walk the streets with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| There's no cakewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| And we're just asking to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| There are a lot of employees in here that are one paycheck away from losing a house, from being on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4714)|
| 1:18:43| These employees are sitting in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| And for you to sit up and say, you know, it's like you live in a glass house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| And, you know, the same people that you see going to the top are the same people that you're going to see falling down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| Don't walk over us because we're the ones that are breaking our back to get up at 7 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| to get ice off the road so you can go to and from for your driveway and up and down your street so that you don't break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4746)|
| 1:19:14| We're the ones that do that, not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| So don't forget about us little old employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4764)|
| 1:19:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you, Mr. Wagner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| So, counsel, is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| So we are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| I'd like to just respond for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Number one, Anita Cash, you don't live in Knoxville and you don't pay taxes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| There are people out there on Social Security living on $19,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Number two, I've been working since I was seven years old, so don't tell me I didn't work for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| I've worked at all kinds of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| I've worked on asphalt, on roofs, on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| And number three, we brought this to the table so we could have an intelligent discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| This city cannot just walk over cliffs without looking at where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| It doesn't matter how this comes out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| What matters is you have a council willing to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| If you don't appreciate that, you're not thinking straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| Any other discussion by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| So hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Is this what's the correct motion for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| I think what we really have here is we have a motion and a second followed by really a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| The motion to amend is to delete the $40,000 cap on that so that it would be across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| removal of the two and one-half percent automatic increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| Am I right about that, Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| And that was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Well, I'm going to withdraw my second because I agree with the last spokesperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| and that was I was trying to make sure that people at the lower end of the pay scale do look forward to that pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| And that's why I put it in there, and I took that midpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| A guy that's making $100,000 a year can live without increase if he didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| So I was doing that, so I'm going to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| I would ask the people in the audience, let's keep it down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| 190,000 people that live in this city, not just you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| Let's have some civility, please, on all fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| So you have removed your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| So your motion does not have a second, which is to totally remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| Well, he might get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| So is there a second to Councilman Wallace's motion, which would, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| remove the two and a half percent for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| So that fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| So now we're to the original motion, which is to remove the two and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| for any employee that makes over $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| or the opposite of that is to keep it for anyone who makes under $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| Is it $40,000 and under or under $40,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| Whatever it says on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| $40,000 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| It was just a midway point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| It could be $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| But we've got $40,000 on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| It's at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| Yes, we're going to have a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4960)|

| 1:22:47| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4971)|

| 1:22:53| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4973)|

| 1:22:55| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| The motion fails six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140401?start=4981)|
