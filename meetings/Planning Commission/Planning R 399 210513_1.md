| 2:35:25| I'll also make the motion to approve the concept plan subject to the 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| We have a motion to approve the concept plan subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| Commissioner Eddie Smith and Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korblick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9338)|
| 2:35:41| I have just a quick question for the applicant on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| One of the criteria that we look at is compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9346)|
| 2:35:52| And I know that these lots are much smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9352)|
| 2:35:55| and that you've asked for a slight reduction in the perimeter setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| And so I wanted to know how heavily you're going to plant that buffer to screen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| from the road to engage in at least trying to be more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| with the larger lots in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| Yeah, this was a conversation we had with staff with this common area strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| along the border or in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| or adjacent to the right-of-way along West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| And we agree we are going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| whether it's a requirement for Knox County or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| we are going to landscape buffer it to have the back of the homes kind of have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| a buffer between West Emory and the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9394)|
| 2:36:39| I didn't quite hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| So you are going to heavily buffer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| Yeah, and I can't remember if the staff recommendation is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| or it's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9406)|
| 2:36:47| I know there's a 25-foot strip of common area as a requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| but I can't remember if we actually have to landscape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| Regardless, we are going to landscape it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| Mr. Reynolds, did you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| I was just going to say that there is not a condition of landscaping of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| 25-foot common area, but obviously they can if they wish to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9430)|
| 2:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9436)|
| 2:37:18| Can I add that then to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9441)|
| 2:37:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| I mean, I don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9444)|
| 2:37:28| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9448)|
| 2:37:37| It was a request by Commissioner Korblick to amend that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| to include landscaping requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| Is Mr. Smith or Mr. Roth, I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| The applicant has already stated he's going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| so I don't think it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| So we motion a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| Ms. Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| I do think that the landscape buffer is important in this case because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| when you do have the double frontage lots, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| most people are going to put a fence in the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| The fences may end up looking different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| So I think the landscaping is super important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9499)|
| 2:38:20| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| Chair will entertain a motion on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| We'll make the motion to approve the development plan for up to 42| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| detached dwelling units and everything else that follows that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| second by Commissioner Roth to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9524)|
| 2:38:45| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| Next item is number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| This is a subdivision concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| This is three motions that are required on variances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| alternative design standards as well as concept development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| Subdivision is Catatoga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| Applicant is developers urban engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| Location, west side of North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| north of Yarnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Zoning is PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| Acreage is 62.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| Number of lots is 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| We have several variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9569)|
| 2:39:37| And then we also have four plus 11 alternative design standards on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9577)|
| 2:39:46| rows A and B combined and alternative design standards requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9586)|
| 2:39:52| Knox County engineering public works approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| which is not required by this commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| So staff recommendation is to approve variances one through 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9597)|
| 2:40:01| and alternative design standards one through 11 on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| recommendation of Knox County Department of Engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| Public Works because the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9607)|
| 2:40:11| with the subdivision regulations and the proposed variances will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| Second motion to approve the concept plan subject to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9620)|
| 2:40:21| Third motion, approve the development plan up to 120 detached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| dwelling units on individual lots subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9625)|
| 2:40:33| Commissioner Phillips, I just want to make one quick clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| I just noticed as I was reading, as you were reading the alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| design standards, the way that I have them listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| I have alternative design standards for road A and then for road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9644)|
| 2:40:45| So there's four for road A and then there's 11 for road B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| So it's actually 15 alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9651)|

| 2:41:21| We're asking that you accept and approve the staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| for the variances, for the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| and for the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| I'd like to bring up Chris Sharp to address the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9691)|
| 2:41:34| I mean the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| He can explain those a lot better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9695)|
| 2:41:42| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| Chris Sharp, Urban Engineering, 11852 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| I realize it is a pretty large number of both variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| and alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| They're all related to horizontal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| and vertical alignment of the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| We try to introduce a series of curves within the road in an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9720)|
| 2:42:06| to reduce driver speeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| so I think that's why engineering was in favor of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9729)|
| 2:42:15| There are more than you would typically see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| but there was a reason behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| Thank you, Mr. Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9740)|
| 2:42:25| As for the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| we are agreeable to comply with the ten conditions recommended by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| The concept plan does comply with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| and will be developed out according to the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| and the requirement of the Department of Engineering and Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| As for the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| the proposed development is consistent with the adopted plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| It's consistent with the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| The approved density, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| at the rezoning to planned residential was up to 1.93 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| This proposal comes in at 1.92 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| It's in harmony with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| This is compatible with the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9785)|
| 2:43:10| It's compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| It will not cause any harm or detriment to the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| It's not going to increase traffic as far as through other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| It has its own access with boulevard separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| We'll connect to the long farm development eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9807)|
| 2:43:33| There are plans and proposals that are set forth on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| that provide for common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| There's community lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| I believe there's some concepts in place for either a dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9822)|
| 2:43:46| or potentially at some point some type of clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| Again, we ask that you just approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| and the concept plan subject to the required conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9837)|
| 2:43:58| We do have two individuals designed to speak who are in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9838)|
| 2:44:03| and they are currently remote, Jennifer Stedstrom and Ryan Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9843)|
| 2:44:10| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| If you'd like to share that time, please give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| This is Ryan Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| I live at 1811 North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| I live next to this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| As we heard from Engineer Snow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| that North Campbell Station Road is a road of such significant regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| and local importance that Knox County is requesting federal assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| to try to help address the road issue because of how heavily trafficked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| the road is becoming and how difficult it is just to improve the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| So we don't even know if road improvement is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| until we get an outside engineering firm to do an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| and then come up with an option and a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| And then as we heard, they suggested possibly creating an entire new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| as a north-south connector just to decompress this road volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| So it is a significant road issue at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| but we don't even know if it's feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| let alone when road improvements might be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| So what I think is most important to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| is that this is not just another Hardin Valley development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| This will be the largest development ever built on North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9912)|
| 2:45:16| And with the approved 18 acres that you just approved adjacent to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9916)|
| 2:45:22| there will be a projected 1,400 projected car trips a day from this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9922)|
| 2:45:28| And so what's worse is that this is at probably the most dangerous location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9928)|
| 2:45:32| with the sharp curve in the road for this huge neighborhood development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9932)|
| 2:45:36| And so everybody who drives this road every day knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9936)|
| 2:45:40| that there will be countless car accidents, injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| traffic backups at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| So I think if the plan is allowed to proceed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| I agree there must be a left and right turn lane into the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9948)|
| 2:45:52| or else it would just be prohibitively dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| But part of the variances requested are to make the turn lane work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9954)|
| 2:45:59| are to really change that radius of curvature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| to actually make it a sharper curve road to try to slow traffic down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9962)|
| 2:46:07| which I think will inadvertently make it almost a 90-degree curve and more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9967)|
| 2:46:12| So I urge you to postpone this development approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| until we at least have some sort of road improvement plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| or at least until we know if Knox County will even receive the federal assistance needed to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9978)|
| 2:46:24| which we don't know when that would be at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| And I wanted to say just because there's a piece of land in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| and someone can build on it and figure out a way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| doesn't mean that they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| And all the red flags that have come up with this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| should cause us to kind of step back and seriously reconsider postponing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| at least until we have a better road improvement plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10003)|
| 2:46:47| So thanks for protecting the Knox County citizens who live here and drive this road every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10007)|
| 2:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Thank you, Mr. Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| Ms. Stenstrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| Hey again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| Jennifer Stenstrom, 1717 Long Farm Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| I'm going to ditto everything that Mr. Dabbs said about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10022)|
| 2:47:08| One thing about traffic studies is it's all on paper and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| but when you actually drive this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| this amount of traffic is going to be such a major concern for all of us who drive it on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10035)|
| 2:47:21| I've talked to many people about how long they have to wait to drop their kids off at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10041)|
| 2:47:28| because this Campbell Station Road is backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| And also the pick-up and drop-off at school is getting extremely dangerous, and that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10051)|
| 2:47:41| And I just wanted to add, when somebody says that it doesn't do any harm to surrounding parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| that is just disingenuous, disingenuine at best, because this is right in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| and it definitely harms my parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| Again, I can't build more than two houses, but now I'm going to look at 120 homes on 62 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10078)|
| 2:48:05| So I would really appreciate it if people would not say that it's not going to cause harm to surrounding parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10091)|
| 2:48:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10092)|
| 2:48:13| Mr. Sharp, do you have anything you want to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| I would like to address one of Mr. Dabbs' statements, that it's inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10096)|
| 2:48:22| We are, you know, as part of the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| it recommended improvements within the curve where our subdivision entrance is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10105)|
| 2:48:31| It recommended a right-turn deceleration lane into the property as well as a left-turn lane into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10111)|
| 2:48:39| Our revised drawings show both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| And none of the variances requested have anything to do with North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10122)|
| 2:48:48| And, you know, as we get into the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| I'll work closely with Knox County Engineering to detail, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| to work out the specifics of the deceleration turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10143)|
| 2:49:04| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10144)|
| 2:49:10| Yeah, I just wanted to just bring up that, you know, on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10150)|
| 2:49:14| a lot of times we ask people and we bemoan not having more common area and amenities in the subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10154)|
| 2:49:24| And I know this piece of land and the way that the developer is utilizing the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10164)|
| 2:49:30| and setting aside a lot of common area, I think, is exactly what we are asking to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10170)|
| 2:49:36| And I think it will make a beautiful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| And my only question is, like, for the developer as representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| are you guys going to have some walking trails or benches or something where people can enjoy that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| Because I know that lake exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| I've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| It's really pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| And it will be a great asset if you can set some land aside with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10192)|
| 2:50:00| Hunter Harrison, 2926 Wofford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| Now, I'm going to have to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| I go to Catatonia every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| I wonder why in the heck I'm building a subdivision there and ought to just move there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| Beautiful lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| I will have a 30- to 40-foot buffer around that lake, which will be common to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10213)|
| 2:50:19| No home will have access directly to their property without directly access to that lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| The bottom section of that lake where it drains, this is a spring-fed pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10224)|
| 2:50:29| drains all the way down to Hardin Valley, will be the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| There will be a swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10232)|
| 2:50:33| There will be a clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| There will be a nice fancy dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| We have been putting brim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| We've been stocking the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| I'm not a fisherman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| But we have been stocking that pond because we go over there Friday afternoon and drink beer and catch fish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| The boulevard, MPC requested at one point to rent a full 800-foot boulevard from North Campbell Station to the first home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10250)|
| 2:51:02| I was in opposition to that because that means I have to knock down all these beautiful trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| So the first structure on this property will not see North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| North Campbell Station will not see the first home in Catatoga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10272)|
| 2:51:17| This is my last subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| I've been in Hardin Valley 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| I want to yell at the people of Saddlebrook behind me because they're taking my fancy boulevard at Mission Hill, but that's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10283)|
| 2:51:30| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10290)|
| 2:51:32| This is my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| Believe me or not, and there's some people in here that know me, I will make this my statement, and it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| And 10 years from now when I'm done building, my son could come see you, and I won't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| But we will make the common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| We will make the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10310)|
| 2:51:51| We will have 85 by 180 to 200-foot deep lots in the second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10311)|
| 2:51:57| Show me that in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| Show me that in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10319)|
| 2:52:02| So because of your sector plan not providing me with LDR, not providing me with the density I request on my original, kept my mouth shut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10322)|
| 2:52:13| We made it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| So we will have nice lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| I would love to have a walking path in the long farm section going down to the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| Slope might constrain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| If I can work it out where slope doesn't constrain that, we'll have a walking path so people have access into this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10345)|
| 2:52:33| I guess I ask you that just to say we see that, appreciate it, and that's the kind of thing we want to see more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10353)|
| 2:52:38| Well, every subdivision I've ever developed, a lot of common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| Massey Creek backing up to Saddlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| And I'm going to argue with Saddlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| Over 12 acres out of 60 common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| So there are some points of economy of scales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10372)|
| 2:52:54| Yeah, I could go cram in another house here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10374)|
| 2:52:56| But why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| It's not feasible because of your site conditions, your land conditions to spend the money to make a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10386)|
| 2:53:07| Now, the opposition, I bought 45 acres in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10387)|
| 2:53:13| I come home two years ago, and I can see good all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| Part of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10399)|
| 2:53:20| Did I like it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| I should have gone to Mr. Ooten and bought the rest of his farm when he had a chance to do it, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| So I don't want to see growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| I will put buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| I will do sloping so that the existing people around there do not feel me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10411)|
| 2:53:37| The easements that Mrs. Stim talked about, in my agreement with the owner who I bought this from, I quit claiming that deed's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10417)|
| 2:53:47| I have no intention of ever driving up Long Farm Way, driving a dump truck up their property, ever accessing that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10427)|
| 2:53:54| I should because it would make it a lot easier for me from a development standpoint of getting my equipment in, but I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10434)|
| 2:54:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10441)|
| 2:54:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| That answered my second question was about traffic has come up, and I look at traffic counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10443)|
| 2:54:09| I think 2019 was around 6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| What is the traffic count today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| It doesn't seem that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| Who are you asking that question to, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10462)|
| 2:54:23| Who are you asking that question to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Whoever knows the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| Mr. Snowden, do you know what the traffic count is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| Current traffic count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| I don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| 2019 showed it at 5,500 cars a day on Campbell Station, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| That's correct, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| It's about between 5,500 and 6,000 cars a day in the section between Yarnell and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10481)|
| 2:54:46| I mean, for a two-lane road like that, is that right now super high, or is that average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10486)|
| 2:54:52| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| Usually when we start looking at improving two-lane roads to multi-lane roads, you're seeing about 15,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10493)|
| 2:55:01| There is a significant volume there that can occur before a multi-lane facility is absolutely required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10501)|
| 2:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10508)|
| 2:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10511)|
| 2:55:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| Mr. Dabbs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10514)|
| 2:55:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10516)|
| 2:55:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10517)|
| 2:55:18| You all have up to a minute to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| I think all due respect to Mr. Harrison, that's great that he's going to make a nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10521)|
| 2:55:26| I think we all expect that now with the neighborhoods being built, that they have to have common areas, and that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10526)|
| 2:55:32| Certainly every surrounding landowner is opposed to this, along with nearly 100 comments that were sent in in the original November hearing for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10532)|
| 2:55:45| I think the biggest issue for most people is the road infrastructure part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10545)|
| 2:55:51| The neighborhood is great, but then that will still be that 1,400 cars a day at that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10551)|
| 2:55:57| Clearly, we say North Campbell Station Road can handle more drive, but why are we then requesting $20 million in federal funding to try to improve the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10557)|
| 2:56:05| It's because we know that it's a serious issue, and we're trying to do that to protect the citizens here for this kind of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10565)|
| 2:56:12| This is a significant-sized neighborhood, a lot bigger than the remaining neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| Just postponing this until we have a better plan or a road improvement in the works would be a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10578)|
| 2:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10585)|
| 2:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| Ms. Stenstrom, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| No, just the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| We're asking for money, and we're building more subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10594)|
| 2:56:37| I can't even imagine what the construction is going to be like, and then people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| How are they going to get out of these subdivisions to get on the road to get to Yarnell or to Hardin Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10602)|
| 2:56:49| It's going to be a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10614)|
| 2:56:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| I want to make a comment and then I'm ready to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10618)|
| 2:57:02| In the concept plan conditions, there is requirements to implement some street intersection improvements that are outlined in the traffic impact study already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10622)|
| 2:57:14| Engineering, we spend a lot of time talking about traffic when we talk about these subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10634)|
| 2:57:20| I think today we've spent most of our time talking about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10640)|
| 2:57:24| I would submit that, unfortunately, roads follow development, not the other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10644)|
| 2:57:31| If we stop, if we just say people can't develop their property anymore until the roads in Knox County are improved enough to handle whatever traffic is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10651)|
| 2:57:40| then we're not going to be developing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| It's unfortunate, but that's how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10662)|
| 2:57:46| I think this is a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10666)|
| 2:57:48| I think the subdivision is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| I think they're going to be required to do some things with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10669)|
| 2:57:54| We have to rely on our traffic engineering people to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10674)|
| 2:57:59| We spend a lot of time sitting here talking about, well, how are they going to do their job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| What are they going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10683)|
| 2:58:04| They get paid to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| We have to take into consideration that traffic is going to be involved in this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10686)|
| 2:58:13| They're going to be involved with the road situations, the entrance and going in and out of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10693)|
| 2:58:19| Having said that, I'd like to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10699)|
| 2:58:24| We approve versions 1 through 10 and the alternate design standards 1 through 11 on road B and 1 through 4 on road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10704)|
| 2:58:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10716)|
| 2:58:38| Before we go to a vote, I see that Commissioner Graf, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10718)|
| 2:58:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| Mine is on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| My question is on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| You can go ahead with this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| Chair will recognize Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10737)|
| 2:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| I did have a question on traffic for either staff or transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10742)|
| 2:59:09| Would the number of cars per day factor into whether there is a turning lane into and out of a subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10749)|
| 2:59:17| Is that the only factor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Or would the curve of Campbell Station Road play into a requirement for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10760)|
| 2:59:27| Mr. Snowden, that's probably more in your area of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10767)|
| 2:59:34| Yes, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| We look at the traffic that's being generated by the development, the turning movements thereof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| as well as the existing volume and essentially the opposing volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10782)|
| 2:59:47| Our access control policy has a NOMA graph that their engineer has used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10787)|
| 2:59:52| to determine that both the left and right turn lane warrants are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| So both for the left turn lanes and right turn lanes to avoid those rear end collisions and right angle collisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10796)|
| 3:00:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10806)|
| 3:00:07| We have a motion by Commissioner Ross, seconded by Commissioner Uten, to approve variances 1 through 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10807)|
| 3:00:14| and alternative design standards 1 through 11 per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10820)|

| 3:00:23| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10823)|
| 3:00:26| Before I entertain a motion for the concept plan, I'll acknowledge Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10826)|
| 3:00:33| On the development plan, it's on page 32-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10833)|
| 3:00:40| Under comments in the first paragraph there, the second sentence or the last sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10840)|
| 3:00:48| the community lake and surrounding common area are proposed as an amenity for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10848)|
| 3:00:57| and may include a clubhouse, dock, pool and parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10857)|
| 3:01:04| My question is, are they on the development plan as this is a fact, not a proposal or a maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10864)|
| 3:01:20| Is this really part of the development plan and is the developer paying for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10880)|
| 3:01:27| or is this something that maybe the homeowners want to do once they take over the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10887)|
| 3:01:42| Potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10902)|
| 3:01:44| Yeah, it says potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10904)|
| 3:01:45| Per my understanding, it's not required to be shown on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| My answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| There will be a pool, there will be a parking lot, there will be a clubhouse, there will be a dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10913)|
| 3:01:57| and I will pay for every dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| And it's all part of the end of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| It is part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10921)|
| 3:02:02| It will be what I will provide to the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| The HOA will not pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| No homeowner will pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10926)|
| 3:02:08| But it will be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10928)|
| 3:02:09| It will be provided, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10931)|
| 3:02:12| That's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10932)|
| 3:02:14| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10934)|
| 3:02:16| Chair will entertain a motion to approve the concept plan subject to ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10936)|
| 3:02:20| I'd like to make that motion, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10942)|

| 3:02:27| to approve the concept plan subject to ten conditions per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10947)|
| 3:02:31| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10953)|
| 3:02:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Chair will entertain a motion on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10959)|
| 3:02:40| I'd like to make a motion to approve the development plan per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| I think Commissioner Korbelick beat you to the punch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| You can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| We have a motion by Commissioner Korbelick, seconded by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| to approve the development plan up to 120 detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10973)|
| 3:02:57| on individual lots subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10977)|

| 3:03:06| Item number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| We have variance, concept, and a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| The subdivision is Old Clinton Pike Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=10994)|
| 3:03:20| The applicant developer is Russell Rackley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| Homestead Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11003)|
| 3:03:26| Location, south side of Old Clinton Pike, west side of Haddock Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11006)|
| 3:03:32| Approximate acres is ten acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| Zoning is PR planned residential, and that is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| Proposed use, attached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| There are subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11023)|
| 3:03:46| Staff recommendation, approve the variance and the recommendations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11026)|
| 3:03:50| Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11030)|
| 3:03:53| and because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11033)|
| 3:03:57| regulations and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11037)|
| 3:04:02| Second motion, approve the concept plan subject to ten conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| Third motion, approve the development plan for up to 50 detached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| I'm sorry, 50 attached dwelling units on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| and a reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11056)|
| 3:04:21| along the Old Clinton Pike frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11061)|

| 3:04:31| Mr. Rackley, you're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11071)|
| 3:04:34| I know that there's Mr. Todd Vanderhorst, who's opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| as well as I think John King is representing some of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11078)|
| 3:04:43| So would you like to go first, or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11083)|
| 3:04:48| I'll go first, but I'll be brief and reserve my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11088)|
| 3:04:51| Your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11091)|

| 3:04:58| representing Homestead Land Holdings, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11098)|
| 3:05:01| Just want to say that we request approval subject to the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11101)|
| 3:05:07| We're okay with all those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| We've made quite a few changes to the layout to provide as much natural wooded area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11109)|
| 3:05:17| to remain as possible by clustering these townhomes in the more usable part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11117)|
| 3:05:24| avoiding the creek and the sensitive or spring creek sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11124)|
| 3:05:28| and the steep wooded area in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| And we're providing for, although not required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| we're providing a 25-foot common area around the periphery of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| as well as maintaining the required 35-foot periphery setback by this PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11139)|
| 3:05:45| And I will reserve the rest of my time and let the opposition speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11145)|
| 3:05:57| Mr. Vanderhorse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11157)|
| 3:06:00| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11160)|
| 3:06:01| Mr. Chairman, I think you will recall we had a short discussion before we started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| and this is the time you concluded that we could present our request for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11166)|
| 3:06:14| at the time the item was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| I'd like to have a postponement of 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11178)|
| 3:06:22| I just got involved in this matter starting last Thursday, a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11182)|
| 3:06:29| and on Friday I was out of the office and out of town all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11189)|
| 3:06:35| So I really got started on this Monday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11195)|
| 3:06:40| There's some questions and some issues that I don't think I have really a full plate of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11200)|
| 3:06:49| that I would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| I'd like to have some time just to get more acquainted with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11211)|
| 3:06:57| I would reserve that this is a request for approval of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11217)|
| 3:07:06| but that the rezoning of the property, the planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11226)|
| 3:07:11| which permits this development, has not yet been passed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11231)|
| 3:07:22| It's up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| The rezoning to PR is up at the end of this month in front of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11244)|
| 3:07:31| So I don't know that postponing this is a big problem as far as timing is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11251)|
| 3:07:40| I am advised by the developer that they do not agree and they oppose my request for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11260)|
| 3:07:51| But I would like a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11271)|
| 3:07:55| So I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11275)|
| 3:07:56| I don't have the ability to make such a motion, but you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11276)|
| 3:08:06| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| Mr. Vanderhorst?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| Are you Mr. Vanderhorst?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| If there's no motion, we're going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11294)|
| 3:08:19| He's a sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11301)|
| 3:08:24| I would make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11304)|
| 3:08:29| I thought that somebody else wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11309)|
| 3:08:33| Well, we do have another individual that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11313)|
| 3:08:37| We had actually Mr. Cureton and Mr. Vanderhorst that were opposing in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11317)|
| 3:08:43| This is Mr. Cureton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| Anything you would like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| He's a representative of the Homeowners Association that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11330)|
| 3:08:58| Before you all vote on such a motion to postpone, I'd like to come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11338)|
| 3:09:05| But if there's going to be a motion to postpone in a second before you vote, I'd like a chance to discuss, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11345)|
| 3:09:13| I think now's the time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11353)|
| 3:09:16| I'm glad Mr. Cureton's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| We have worked with the Homeowners Association, Mr. Cureton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11358)|
| 3:09:22| We spoke with him on March 17th at 3.09 p.m. for nine minutes when he first contacted my clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11362)|
| 3:09:29| and on April 26th at 11.10 a.m. for 19 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11369)|
| 3:09:34| He had three primary concerns, the adjacency of this subdivision next to theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11374)|
| 3:09:41| We have provided from day one a 25-foot common area buffer between our development and their subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11381)|
| 3:09:47| which is not required by PR zoning, but we did to provide a tree buffer both for our development and theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11387)|
| 3:09:56| It came back that there was a couple of areas along their property line where there aren't trees in that 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11396)|
| 3:10:02| So we agreed and amended the plan, working with Mr. Reynolds at Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11402)|
| 3:10:07| to add a note to provide MPC type B single row evergreen screening in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11407)|
| 3:10:15| or any area where no trees will remain or no trees currently exist along that buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11415)|
| 3:10:19| to screen our residents from them and them from our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11419)|
| 3:10:25| They also voiced a concern about the type of product, meaning townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| as one of their residents said in a quite colorful letter to the MPC, called them barrack-style tenement housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11428)|
| 3:10:35| I will note that Hunter Crossing is comprised of 42 percent attached homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| Forty-two percent of the total residents in their neighborhood is either duplex or triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11440)|
| 3:10:46| So I don't know why they have a problem with townhomes on an adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| The third area of concern that Mr. Curitan expressed was impact on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11452)|
| 3:10:58| Currently, in their neighborhood, the average comp is around $160 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11458)|
| 3:11:05| What we're proposing are townhomes of around 1,350 square feet for a target price of $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11465)|
| 3:11:12| That is $166 per square foot cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| So there will be no impact on their property value whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| In fact, providing smaller square footage in today's age where material and construction prices are going through the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11480)|
| 3:11:26| a mile up the road from an elementary school provides housing choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| current modern housing choice for people who can't afford that same square footage in a 3,000 or 3,500 or 2,500 square foot home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11491)|
| 3:11:39| but they can afford a nice new resident in a smaller square footage home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11499)|
| 3:11:44| There was someone that was most concerned about the drainage runoff going onto their property from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| Actually, all their subdivision, our subdivision back up to Black Oak Ridge, most of their water drains across us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11509)|
| 3:11:57| There is a small area that drains across the back of two of their lots before it reenters our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11517)|
| 3:12:03| My proposed design, you can look at the grading on the concept plan, has a cutoff swell in the back of the lots that intercepts about 40 percent of that drainage basin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11523)|
| 3:12:10| that's currently running across the back of two of their lots and routes it down behind our development and around to the front of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11530)|
| 3:12:19| So the remainder of the storm drainage is handled in the street with storm drainage detention pond, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| It never went their direction anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11544)|
| 3:12:26| So I believe that we have worked both with the Hunter Crossing HOA over the last several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11546)|
| 3:12:32| along with the residents who aren't here on both the east and west who we've been working with all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11552)|
| 3:12:37| who live on large lot parcels and not in a divided subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| So we've worked with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| There should be no postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| We have listened to every comment that was sent to Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| We've made adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11568)|
| 3:12:50| We've made clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11570)|
| 3:12:51| We've done our best to give what is a really nice development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11571)|
| 3:12:56| maintaining the utmost natural area, treat area around our development for the benefit of our customers and the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11576)|
| 3:13:05| So, again, I respectfully ask that you vote and ask that you approve this concept plan subject to staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11585)|
| 3:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| Since it was at my request the motion was made, I guess we need to go ahead and see whether there's a second to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11599)|
| 3:13:30| and whether we go forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11610)|
| 3:13:34| If we go forward, I hope the chair would entertain the thought of deducting from the developer the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11614)|
| 3:13:43| that he was talking about the project and things other than what was related to the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11623)|
| 3:13:50| Mr. King, once it goes to the commission for consideration, you may not have another opportunity to request anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11630)|
| 3:13:58| So I think at this time, if you have some comments you'd like to make, you need to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11638)|
| 3:14:04| I would second the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| You have a motion on the floor, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11648)|
| 3:14:10| You have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| We don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11652)|
| 3:14:14| I second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| You extended the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11656)|
| 3:14:17| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11657)|
| 3:14:18| You seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| I'm seconding the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| We have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| So at this point, there's no point in talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11662)|
| 3:14:26| Before we go to a vote, I'll recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11666)|
| 3:14:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11671)|
| 3:14:32| And help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11672)|
| 3:14:34| So the developer reached out to your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| Sorry, the gentleman that was just speaking at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11677)|
| 3:14:41| I can't remember the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11683)|
| 3:14:44| Mr. Kerrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11684)|
| 3:14:45| Okay, Mr. Kerrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| You first had a conversation with the developer on March the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11687)|
| 3:14:51| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11691)|
| 3:14:52| I was thinking about that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| I asked him what he was planning on doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| He told me that they were going to come up a padlock, which is east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11697)|
| 3:15:02| They were not coming near us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| We did not oppose the change in zoning because, he said, we're not even near you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11705)|
| 3:15:11| We're not coming back toward you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| We're staying over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11713)|
| 3:15:14| We want that flat ground up through there, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| Okay, let me finish my question because I'm not going to get into the he said, he said conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11717)|
| 3:15:22| But you agree that the developer first approached you on March the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11722)|
| 3:15:26| He filed his application for this on March the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11726)|
| 3:15:30| My concern comes in is that you didn't hire anyone to represent you until less than a week before this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11730)|
| 3:15:37| and your counsel just started working on this four days before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11737)|
| 3:15:41| That's my issue with this, is that everything's been drug out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| I won't be supporting the 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11745)|
| 3:15:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| He told me they were not coming against our east boundary at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| They were staying over on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| He said he was building probably, now I'll say probably because he did, a unit with two townhouses in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11757)|
| 3:16:03| He didn't give me a size at all, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| And other than that, now that was before, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11766)|
| 3:16:12| Far as I can remember, I had no conversation with him after that time, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11772)|
| 3:16:18| I've asked him to send me a concept drawing at the time we talked originally, and he said he would as soon as he got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11778)|
| 3:16:25| The only time I got a concept drawing, I got Mike Reynolds to send it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11785)|
| 3:16:30| He sent me a PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11790)|
| 3:16:31| I like to fill over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| And I appreciate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| What we can look at is not any conversation you all had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| We can only look at what the developer submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| I'm looking at that, plus then I'm looking at what you admit, that he talked to you 12 days before he submitted his application, that you all did have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11802)|
| 3:16:52| He submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| I'm looking at the timeline of how all this is developed, and that at the very nth hour, now our request is coming up for a 30-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11813)|
| 3:17:00| which I don't think necessarily is fair to the developer who went through all the steps to have the conversations and to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11820)|
| 3:17:06| to make accommodations with staff and come up with all of the different processes through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11826)|
| 3:17:12| now to kind of throw a wrench in at the last second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| That's where I'm kind of struggling with asking for the 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11834)|
| 3:17:20| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11840)|
| 3:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11843)|
| 3:17:26| I will not support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11846)|
| 3:17:29| The applicant has indicated conversations, compromises with all of the adjoining neighbors to some degree or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11849)|
| 3:17:39| and I fail to see what a postponement will actually gain, given that the concept of townhomes is the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11859)|
| 3:17:50| and providing screening, he's looked at drainage, he's worked with neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11870)|
| 3:17:56| and I simply don't see the point of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11879)|
| 3:18:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| I'm just going to state why I'm supporting the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11883)|
| 3:18:06| which is the fact that for the developers, for the professionals who are doing this type of work all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11886)|
| 3:18:14| this process is something that they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11894)|
| 3:18:17| They're very accustomed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| And for individuals who are citizens who are all of a sudden finding themselves faced with a circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11899)|
| 3:18:26| that is completely unfamiliar to them, while the timeline to us may seem very quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11906)|
| 3:18:32| to them, they're having to learn from square one as to what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11912)|
| 3:18:37| So what I hope will happen during the postponement is that since the developer has been open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11917)|
| 3:18:45| and conversant and trying to work through things, that there are a few more voices that they may need to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11925)|
| 3:18:51| to find that consensus spot where everyone is comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| 30 days seems worth that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11935)|
| 3:18:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11940)|
| 3:19:03| Mr. Curitan, have you been before us before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| No, not in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| When will the rezoning be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| Rezoning is not approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| When is it supposed to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| It will be on county commission this month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| What day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11964)|
| 3:19:26| 24th or 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| The rezoning is not totally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| It will get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11972)|
| 3:19:34| Well, we're rezoning from RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| I know. It's kind of a down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| We're cutting the density in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| I mean, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11980)|
| 3:19:41| There are issues where I'd like to get it done quick, and I'm not saying you shouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| but I'm also saying, you know, if there's any way you can give a little bit, sometimes...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11984)|
| 3:19:50| No, I had this conversation with Mr. King last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11990)|
| 3:19:55| There's no physical way to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| This isn't just a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| I could submit this tomorrow to Leo at the county and would get it approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=11999)|
| 3:20:03| if I had the drainage calcs ready to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| It is nailed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| It is maximum density allowed by the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12007)|
| 3:20:10| The only variance is because there's not enough frontage to get the intersection spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12010)|
| 3:20:16| There's no other variances on any of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| The only way to move and give them more buffer that we're not required by zoning to give any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12018)|
| 3:20:25| but we're already giving, the only way to give more is to lose unit count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| which is a negative impact on the developer's investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12029)|
| 3:20:34| It's a taking of his future profits to give additional buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12034)|
| 3:20:40| that's more than what we're already voluntarily providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12040)|
| 3:20:44| There's no physical way to change this layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| A 30-day delay will do nothing but put us right back here looking at the same plan in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12047)|
| 3:20:53| I'm happy to talk with them all they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| I can explain the drainage patterns and how this project isn't impacting the runoff in their yards at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12055)|
| 3:21:03| But there's no structural changes to the actual layout and the design that will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12063)|
| 3:21:08| That can occur without taking money out of the pocket of the investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12068)|
| 3:21:12| I believe you 100%, and I'm not, this one's hard because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| but sometimes creating a little goodwill even though it does in the end, it's not going to make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12076)|
| 3:21:20| You're talking about two or three weeks difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| We believe we did with the two conversations, and we have the call logs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| Well, no, you had it with Mr. Tredzewski back there with Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| I'm sorry. That's all I have. I just wanted to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| Well, we thought we had goodwill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| I was shocked when he called me yesterday and said that they had hired legal representation to ask for a delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12096)|
| 3:21:41| because I'm like, we've been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| Mr. Reynolds can tell you. He's emailed me three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| Hey, we got this letter. They're asking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| Oh, well, no, yeah, we'll do that. We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12108)|
| 3:21:50| I had a guy call looking at a house to buy in the corner of their neighborhood and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12110)|
| 3:21:54| hey, I looked at your plan, and you're not showing anything in this back corner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12114)|
| 3:21:57| Will that remain? Would it? Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| Okay, great. I'm going to call the realtor and put in an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| So we thought we had done it, and so y'all that know me know that I don't try to put a square peg in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12121)|
| 3:22:08| And so I guess I get a little – I take it a little personal when somebody wants to say, oh, well, you didn't do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12128)|
| 3:22:15| You didn't do this right because I try to do everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12135)|
| 3:22:18| I don't think anybody's saying you did anything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12138)|
| 3:22:20| I know. I'm just – I get a little excited because I work really hard to back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| I know. You do a good job, and Mr. King's a reasonable guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| So I'm just trying to see if this way y'all can get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| We need to continue on. Chair will recognize Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12151)|
| 3:22:36| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| You know, I think this developer has done exactly what we have encouraged developers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12158)|
| 3:22:43| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| I'm sorry. Can you not hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| Get a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| Okay. I think this developer has done exactly what we've encouraged developers to do in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12168)|
| 3:22:55| Now, we've granted a lot of postponements where developers and builders have failed to meet with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12175)|
| 3:23:04| have not made any effort, which is certainly warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12184)|
| 3:23:09| But in this situation, this guy has – he's made the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12189)|
| 3:23:13| He's got his notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12193)|
| 3:23:14| He's gone through all the right steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12194)|
| 3:23:17| And, you know, we think, well, 30 days, it might – you know, what's the big deal, 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12197)|
| 3:23:22| Well, right now, I mean, construction costs and everything, I mean, 30 days is a big deal to a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12202)|
| 3:23:30| So I would have a very hard time supporting this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12210)|
| 3:23:36| Seeing no other comments, we do have a motion by Commissioner Graf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| seconded by Commissioner Adams to grant a 30-day postponement on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12219)|
| 3:23:46| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12226)|

| 3:25:18| That's what you all were supposed to do preceding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12318)|
| 3:25:22| I mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12322)|

| 3:25:32| I will grant you three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12332)|

| 3:25:41| Mr. King, I mentioned earlier that once it goes to commission for voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12341)|
| 3:25:47| that's when all conversations between the applicant and the opposition stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12347)|
| 3:25:52| Now, you were relying on a motion being made to postpone the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12352)|
| 3:25:58| postpone the project, and that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12358)|
| 3:26:01| I will grant you three minutes to state your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12361)|

| 3:26:23| You requested, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12383)|

| 3:26:44| I want to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12404)|
| 3:26:47| You're now saying we can discuss concept plan and the development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12407)|
| 3:26:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12413)|
| 3:26:54| Yes, that's what our term is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12414)|
| 3:26:55| How much time do I have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12415)|
| 3:26:58| I said three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| If we need to go more, I'll entertain suggestions from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12421)|
| 3:27:05| We need to get this meeting moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| I object and register objection to the imposition, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12427)|
| 3:27:14| of a limit on the amount of time limiting us to less time than the opponents had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12434)|
| 3:27:23| You've already had-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12443)|
| 3:27:24| I didn't start arguing this matter during a request for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| It was my opponents that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| Old people who are here from Hunter's Crossing-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12452)|

| 3:27:45| Any objection from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| Anybody second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12467)|
| 3:27:48| Mr. King, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12468)|

| 3:28:07| if I may, would you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12489)|

| 3:28:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12505)|
| 3:28:26| It's a unique subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12506)|
| 3:28:27| It's a gorgeous place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| It's over 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| It has been totally maintained and totally taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| It's a jewel of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12514)|
| 3:28:36| The 85% of the people in there are the ages in the 70s, 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12516)|
| 3:28:41| and some of the 90s, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| The homes are brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12523)|
| 3:28:44| Where additions, small additions have been added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12524)|
| 3:28:47| there is some vinyl on those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| Homes are at least all 75% brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12529)|
| 3:28:54| The condo area, they're all brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12534)|
| 3:28:57| and there's two condos to a home, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12537)|
| 3:29:00| They're single-floor dwellings in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12540)|
| 3:29:04| About 11% of them have some two-floor areas to them, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12544)|
| 3:29:09| And it's a very desirable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12549)|
| 3:29:12| Now, you know, we got a zone changing because of what I was originally told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12552)|
| 3:29:18| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12558)|
| 3:29:19| And, you know, that, nothing to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12559)|
| 3:29:25| But the zoning says I get a 35-foot periphery around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12565)|
| 3:29:30| and now he's saying he's going to give me another 25 beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12570)|
| 3:29:34| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12574)|
| 3:29:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12577)|
| 3:29:38| You know, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12578)|
| 3:29:39| But if you looked at the house plans that they have put up here for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12579)|
| 3:29:44| houses themselves, they say that there's common townhouses around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12584)|
| 3:29:51| I actually gave you pictures of townhouses, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| They're brick, mostly brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| One whole section on West Shire has all two-car garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12597)|
| 3:30:02| They're 35, 36 feet each on, no, Brookshire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12602)|
| 3:30:08| On West Shire, there is some single garages and double garages, and you see the brick, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12608)|
| 3:30:15| That's what's close to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| This is not compatible in any shape, form, or fashion to what we have at Hunter's Crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12618)|
| 3:30:25| And that's one of the requirements in the PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12625)|
| 3:30:28| It's got to be compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12628)|
| 3:30:30| Your street up front, Old Platt and Pike, it's 17 feet white line to white line, 17 1⁄2 up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12630)|
| 3:30:37| You go a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12637)|
| 3:30:38| The only way to get out, if you go to the right coming out of Southern Vision, you can only go south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12638)|
| 3:30:43| You have to go three-quarters of a mile to West Emory to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| That road, once you turn after a quarter of a mile, you turn, it's 17 feet wide, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12647)|
| 3:30:55| Now, that could be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| Drainage has always been a problem in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| We have some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12659)|
| 3:31:00| If you'll blow this up, what we had a while ago, we'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12660)|
| 3:31:05| On our lots, 225 or 325, can you blow it up a little bigger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12665)|
| 3:31:12| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12672)|

| 3:31:16| I'll work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12676)|
| 3:31:17| All right, there's what you look for townhouses, 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12677)|
| 3:31:21| How many of y'all had 20 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| And there's 19 of them back up to four of our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| A little over an anchor, there's 19 homes backing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12687)|
| 3:31:32| There are two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| The houses backed up are one-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| You know, they are going to hurt that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12696)|
| 3:31:40| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12700)|
| 3:31:41| You know, they got a same car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| How many square feet you going to get after you put a garage in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12703)|
| 3:31:46| And that's what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12706)|
| 3:31:48| But we're looking at 19 of them backed up against our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12708)|
| 3:31:51| And there is runoff problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12711)|

| 3:32:30| It grades right down on their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12750)|
| 3:32:33| His ditch is halfway down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| An open ditch is a nightmare and a maintenance just a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12755)|
| 3:32:39| Try to keep an open ditch on one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12761)|
| 3:32:42| Now, his lot runs back in the buffers on two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12762)|
| 3:32:46| And his clearing cut comes within 15 feet of our line down on this end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12766)|
| 3:32:53| Now, that's on the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| He may be proud of them, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12775)|
| 3:32:58| I don't have a problem with the drawings, but they don't perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12778)|
| 3:33:01| and they don't help our subdivision in a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| They harm us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| And they attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| Thank you, Mr. Cureton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12787)|
| 3:33:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12788)|
| 3:33:09| Five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12789)|
| 3:33:10| Mr. Rackley, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12790)|
| 3:33:12| I won't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12792)|
| 3:33:13| I just wanted to clarify a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12793)|
| 3:33:16| They actually have four triplexes in their neighborhood, not that it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12796)|
| 3:33:19| They're mostly duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| They're 42% attached, but four of those are triplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| We are downgrading from RB, 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| We could put 120 apartments in here to PR5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12807)|
| 3:33:31| and we're clustering this to protect the open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| The drainage will be handled and improved at engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12813)|
| 3:33:37| The cul-de-sac end he just pointed to is actually cutting down seven feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12817)|
| 3:33:41| and cutting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12821)|
| 3:33:42| A good portion of the area draining across their lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12822)|
| 3:33:45| will never touch their lots ever again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| and, in fact, improve the neighbor behind their subdivision west of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12827)|
| 3:33:52| on old Clinton Pike that confided in us the drainage nightmare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| that their neighborhood caused for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| And we told him that by cutting off some of this drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12838)|
| 3:34:01| and routing it through our pond, we'll actually improve his situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12841)|
| 3:34:05| So another neighbor who doesn't have anything to do with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| other than their neighborhood created a problem for him back in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| 30 years ago, whenever it was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| So, again, we've tried our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12853)|
| 3:34:17| We've done everything that we know to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| We've responded to questions and concerns that have come in through staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12859)|

| 3:34:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12871)|
| 3:34:32| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12872)|

| 3:35:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12903)|
| 3:35:04| One nay, Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12904)|
| 3:35:06| I'd like to make a motion we approve the development plan for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12906)|
| 3:35:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12910)|
| 3:35:11| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12911)|
| 3:35:14| to approve the development plan for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12919)|
| 3:35:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12920)|
| 3:35:21| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12921)|
| 3:35:22| One nay, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12922)|
| 3:35:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12925)|
| 3:35:29| On to item 34 that was removed off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12929)|
| 3:35:35| This is a subdivision concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12935)|
| 3:35:39| Require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| Subdivision is Fox Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| The location is northeast intersection of Fox Road and George Williams Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12943)|
| 3:35:48| Acreage is 4.16 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12948)|
| 3:35:51| Zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12951)|
| 3:35:54| Number of lots, 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12954)|
| 3:35:56| There are several variances, subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12956)|
| 3:36:01| Staff recommendation, approve variances one through four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12961)|
| 3:36:05| And alternative design standards on the recommendations of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12965)|
| 3:36:12| Because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12972)|
| 3:36:17| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12977)|
| 3:36:21| Also approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| Third motion, approve the development plan up to 12 detached dwelling units on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12986)|
| 3:36:32| and reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=12992)|
| 3:36:40| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13000)|
| 3:36:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13002)|
| 3:36:44| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13004)|
| 3:36:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13007)|
| 3:36:48| Your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| Richard LeMay, Jr., 10816 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13010)|
| 3:36:55| I'm one of the engineers on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13017)|
| 3:36:58| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13018)|
| 3:37:01| I believe Mr. Reynolds had some reason to pull it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13021)|
| 3:37:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13027)|
| 3:37:10| When they submitted their revised plans, they had two requests for the cul-de-sac radiuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13030)|
| 3:37:16| one being to reduce the pavement, the curb radius from 40 feet to 38 feet, which engineering staff is okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13036)|
| 3:37:27| The other variance that they requested was to reduce the right-of-way width from 50 foot wide to 40 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13047)|
| 3:37:34| This caused an issue with First Utility District with not having enough space between the curb line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13054)|
| 3:37:42| and the property lines to put utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13062)|
| 3:37:45| The engineers have worked with First Utility to increase the right-of-way request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13065)|
| 3:37:52| I guess to lessen the request of variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| And I apologize again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13076)|
| 3:37:58| There should be six variances on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13078)|
| 3:38:01| Recommendation number five needs to be revised from a request of reduction of right-of-way cul-de-sac radius width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13081)|
| 3:38:10| from 50 feet to 48 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| So instead of 50 to 40, it needs to be 50 to 48 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13093)|
| 3:38:18| That was agreed upon by the applicant and the First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13098)|
| 3:38:28| We'd be happy to comply with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| I'm sorry, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13111)|
| 3:38:32| What did you say the right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13112)|
| 3:38:35| It's variance number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13117)|
| 3:38:38| It's the cul-de-sac right-of-way width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| They wanted 40, and First Utility said that wasn't going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13121)|
| 3:38:45| Yes, because there was only two feet between the back of the curb line to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13125)|
| 3:38:50| And so did we find an intermediate distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13130)|
| 3:38:54| Yes, that 48 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13134)|
| 3:38:56| 48 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13136)|
| 3:38:57| I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13137)|
| 3:38:58| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| So, Chair, I'll make the motion that we approve the variances, as Mike Reynolds suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13139)|
| 3:39:05| on number five, changing it from 50 to 40, from 50 to 40 to 50 to 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13145)|
| 3:39:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13151)|
| 3:39:12| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13152)|
| 3:39:16| approve the variances per statute recommendation and changes as noted by Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13156)|
| 3:39:23| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13165)|
| 3:39:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13166)|
| 3:39:27| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| Make the motion to approve the development plan for up to 12 detached dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| Excuse me, concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13176)|
| 3:39:37| Oh, sorry, I am way ahead of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13177)|
| 3:39:39| Let's do that one then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13179)|

| 3:41:55| Well, I'm not really opposed to any development around Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13315)|
| 3:42:01| I've been there all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| But the way that floods in that area is just absolutely incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13323)|
| 3:42:10| This building that he's wanting to put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13330)|
| 3:42:17| I don't know what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| but the floor level is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13339)|
| 3:42:22| the finished floor level is going to be like five feet higher than, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13342)|
| 3:42:28| Firestone, excuse me, free service tire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13348)|
| 3:42:32| which is probably going to be, what, 20 or 30 feet to the side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13352)|
| 3:42:38| It's going to be five feet, the finished floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13358)|
| 3:42:41| five feet higher than the building right next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13361)|
| 3:42:46| And we've got a creek that runs right behind there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13366)|
| 3:42:50| and I have an apartment building on the other side of the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13370)|
| 3:42:53| And when it rains steady for two, two and a half hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13373)|
| 3:43:00| that creek starts, I mean, it's filled up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13380)|
| 3:43:04| and then it's coming towards the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13384)|
| 3:43:06| I mean, it's just a flood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13386)|
| 3:43:08| It's a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13388)|
| 3:43:10| And I don't know what kind of impact that's going to have on that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13390)|
| 3:43:16| but it's already really bad as far as flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13396)|
| 3:43:25| I mean, water on Broadway gets up above the bottom part of your door on your car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13405)|
| 3:43:33| when it rains for a good period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13413)|
| 3:43:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13418)|
| 3:43:39| Any other comments you'd like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13420)|
| 3:43:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13421)|
| 3:43:42| Mr. Bialik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13422)|
| 3:43:43| Bialik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13423)|
| 3:43:51| As one of the comments that's been made by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13431)|
| 3:43:53| we have to provide a no-rise certificate for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13433)|
| 3:43:57| We have a preliminary report already done that shows the free service tire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13437)|
| 3:44:02| acts as effectively a dam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| and even with us filling five feet behind them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13444)|
| 3:44:08| it will have zero impact on anything upstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13448)|
| 3:44:11| and or downstream of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13451)|
| 3:44:14| We will have a no-rise report with our submittal for full design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13454)|
| 3:44:19| So that's all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13459)|
| 3:44:22| And, by the way, the building is set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13462)|
| 3:44:25| even with the variances for the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13465)|
| 3:44:29| the building itself will set outside of the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13469)|
| 3:44:34| It will be in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13474)|
| 3:44:36| But we also have to waterproof the building for the 500-year flood issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13476)|
| 3:44:41| as required by city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13481)|
| 3:44:43| So we're doing everything we can within them without asking for any variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13483)|
| 3:44:48| or asking for a FEMA update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13488)|
| 3:44:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13491)|
| 3:44:53| I just would like approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13493)|
| 3:44:55| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13497)|
| 3:45:01| I think Commissioner Smith had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13501)|
| 3:45:05| I'll defer to you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13505)|
| 3:45:07| I just had a question about the traffic pattern with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13507)|
| 3:45:11| because it's the – help me, I just lost my word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13511)|
| 3:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13517)|
| 3:45:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| The drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| How the back of the property works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| if a car coming in has the ability to get out any other way than the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13523)|
| 3:45:29| off of Broadway, is there something off of the side behind the tire facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13529)|
| 3:45:35| We would love to have a cross-access agreement with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13535)|
| 3:45:38| but they want $150,000 for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| So I guess –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| No, I have talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13543)|
| 3:45:44| and have been approached by the property owner to the south of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13544)|
| 3:45:47| Mr. Mishue, who owns the development below us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13547)|
| 3:45:51| He is willing to work out a cross-access agreement with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13551)|
| 3:45:56| but we haven't approached that yet because we've got to get through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| before we can even start discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13559)|
| 3:46:02| So thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13562)|
| 3:46:05| Is there someone from planning or engineering who could also just fill me in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13565)|
| 3:46:10| little bit on how that works at the back of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13570)|
| 3:46:14| If it's strictly right now, we're going to be approving a car can come in off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13574)|
| 3:46:18| Broadway and they can leave back onto Broadway and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13578)|
| 3:46:23| Legally, yes, that would be the way it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13583)|
| 3:46:26| Currently, that is an open back to all those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13586)|
| 3:46:29| so someone could technically drive between the two unless there was a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13589)|
| 3:46:34| put up between the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13594)|
| 3:46:36| So as part of this development, they're not proposing to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13596)|
| 3:46:41| they're proposing to design the driveway to allow that connection between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13601)|
| 3:46:46| rear of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13606)|
| 3:46:49| There's no guarantee that unless the easements are approved between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13609)|
| 3:46:53| property owners that that's going to remain open permanently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13613)|
| 3:46:56| So right now we know the Broadway access is feasible and they do need to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13616)|
| 3:47:03| variance from the intersection to the city, what border zone it feels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13623)|
| 3:47:10| But outside of that variance request, that their access appears to be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13630)|
| 3:47:18| on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13638)|
| 3:47:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13639)|
| 3:47:28| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13648)|
| 3:47:30| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13650)|
| 3:47:33| To the gentleman who had the concerns, I have lived in Fountain City for a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13653)|
| 3:47:38| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13658)|

| 3:47:40| I know right where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| And I have lived there long enough that I can remember when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13661)|
| 3:47:44| you could go bass fishing up and down Broadway because it flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13664)|
| 3:47:47| So, you know, the development just to the south of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13667)|
| 3:47:51| which is the Lamberts all the way down to the west pen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13671)|
| 3:47:55| they did raise that when that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| So I think we have to trust that our staff has looked at this and that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13677)|
| 3:48:01| meets all of the requirements that it's not going to adversely affect to cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13681)|
| 3:48:06| worse draining in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13686)|
| 3:48:07| So I would say we've got to look to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13687)|
| 3:48:10| I mean, there's going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13690)|
| 3:48:12| there's going to be those rare exceptions where Broadway will flood again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13692)|
| 3:48:15| It's just the nature of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| However, a lot of what happened way farther south coming into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13697)|
| 3:48:22| you know, when they fix first Creek on down towards, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13702)|
| 3:48:26| fountain lanes, bowling area, when they fix all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13706)|
| 3:48:29| it actually has helped a lot of the flooding farther up north than what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13709)|
| 3:48:32| used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13712)|
| 3:48:33| So I think we have to trust our engineering and our planning staff that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| have looked at all of that and they're doing everything they can to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| future flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13719)|
| 3:48:40| So I would just advise you with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13720)|
| 3:48:42| knowing that area very well and having lived out in that area that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13722)|
| 3:48:46| something that I would also be very comfortable with having lived in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13726)|
| 3:48:49| area for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13729)|
| 3:48:54| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13734)|
| 3:48:56| I can make a motion to approve request for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13736)|
| 3:49:01| I have a motion by commissioner Ross second by commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13741)|
| 3:49:05| Eddie Smith or approve the request. First dash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13745)|
| 3:49:09| All in favor of the motion say aye. Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13749)|
| 3:49:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| Last item for consideration is item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13755)|
| 3:49:19| This is an amendment to Knox and Knox County proposed by Knox and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13759)|
| 3:49:22| County planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13762)|
| 3:49:24| And I'll turn it over to director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13764)|
| 3:49:30| Thank you chairman. I appreciate commissioner Hill pulling this off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| I want to be really clear and transparent about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13773)|
| 3:49:38| You know, as I mentioned during the agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13778)|
| 3:49:40| we made some changes based on conversations with city law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13780)|
| 3:49:44| I had a followup conversation with the city law department and an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13784)|
| 3:49:49| edit was made to clarify that a healthcare institution with onsite emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13789)|
| 3:49:52| room in any district can apply for a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13792)|
| 3:49:57| And you'll see that marked on the second page of article 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13797)|
| 3:50:03| It is, it should be highlighted. I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| I don't actually don't think this was printed in color, but it's 13.7 B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13805)|
| 3:50:13| Sorry. 13.7 D right under the bold there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13813)|
| 3:50:18| So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13818)|
| 3:50:20| we are just trying to clarify that if you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13820)|
| 3:50:22| if there is a healthcare institution with has an onsite emergency room that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13822)|
| 3:50:28| they can go through the master sign plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13828)|
| 3:50:31| regardless of the district that they're located in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13831)|
| 3:50:34| Does anyone have any questions? I do know that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13834)|
| 3:50:37| there should be someone signed up to speak as well on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13837)|
| 3:50:45| I'm here. Can you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| can you it's Joyce fell to signed up to speak from scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13847)|
| 3:50:55| Miss fell. Do you have a five minutes please? And you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| give us your name and your address please. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13858)|
| 3:51:02| My name is Joyce fell. I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13862)|
| 3:51:06| Knoxville, Tennessee, three seven nine one nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13866)|
| 3:51:09| And I'm here as president of scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13869)|
| 3:51:13| These standards have been under development for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13873)|
| 3:51:16| but scenic Knoxville is pleased with the result and proud to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13876)|
| 3:51:21| proposed changes before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| the standards are appropriate to the uses permitted in the newly created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13883)|
| 3:51:27| institutional district and the model and standards mesh well with the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13887)|
| 3:51:31| the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| We especially want to thank director Brooks for working closely with us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13893)|
| 3:51:37| other stakeholders and thoughtfully addressing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13897)|
| 3:51:41| So scenic Knoxville respectfully requests that you vote to recommend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| proposal to city council. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13905)|
| 3:51:50| Sure. Recognize this commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13910)|
| 3:51:52| Thank you chair Phillips. The only question I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13912)|
| 3:51:54| I just want to clarify is there somewhere that defines very clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13914)|
| 3:51:59| emergency room versus what a lot of hospitals are also starting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13919)|
| 3:52:03| which are emergency clinics that are not necessarily attached. Sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| sometimes they're standalone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| I just want to make sure we don't get into an issue where somebody's claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13929)|
| 3:52:12| they have an emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13932)|
| 3:52:13| which in an emergency clinic that doesn't handle the emergency room thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13933)|
| 3:52:17| So that's my only thought as a lot of the healthcare is changing that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13937)|
| 3:52:23| thought through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13943)|
| 3:52:24| that there's actually definition of emergency room somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13944)|
| 3:52:29| We don't have a definition for emergency room in the code currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13949)|
| 3:52:33| Just something that y'all might want to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13953)|
| 3:52:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13959)|
| 3:52:42| I'll make a motion to approve for the staff recommendation of the text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13962)|
| 3:52:48| amendments to the city's Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13968)|
| 3:52:50| Article 13 is shown on attachment one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13970)|
| 3:52:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| We have a motion by commissioner Hill, seconded by commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13975)|
| 3:52:58| to approve the amendment per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13978)|
| 3:53:01| All in favor of the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13981)|
| 3:53:04| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13984)|
| 3:53:06| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13986)|
| 3:53:08| One last thing before we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13988)|
| 3:53:11| This was brought up at Tuesday's meeting about a little get together for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13991)|
| 3:53:15| the commission and some of the staff and looking at the following days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=13995)|
| 3:53:23| May 29th, which is a Saturday or June 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14003)|
| 3:53:27| which is a Friday and we're June 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14007)|
| 3:53:30| Are any of those dates that do not work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14010)|
| 3:53:34| May 29th, since it's Memorial Day, people might have plans already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14014)|
| 3:53:38| But other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14018)|
| 3:53:40| everybody okay with either the 4th or 5th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| That's what we'll shoot for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| And either commissioner Graf or I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| we'll get back with you here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14033)|
| 3:53:54| Commissioner Graf for hosting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14034)|
| 3:53:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14036)|
| 3:53:57| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14037)|
| 3:53:58| I think it's important that we get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14038)|
| 3:54:00| Just socially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14040)|
| 3:54:02| meet some of the staff that make these recommendations for us and meet each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14042)|
| 3:54:06| other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14046)|
| 3:54:08| I know I stood alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14048)|
| 3:54:10| got one vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| but I don't hold it against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14052)|
| 3:54:15| We'll walk out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| Let's get together and have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14057)|

| 3:54:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14067)|
| 3:54:28| I just want to say this is our last meeting with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14068)|
| 3:54:31| Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14071)|
| 3:54:32| And I want to say that it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14072)|
| 3:54:34| it's been a pleasure to serve with him on the commission here as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14074)|
| 3:54:38| attorney and wish him well in his retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14078)|
| 3:54:41| spending time with his grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14081)|
| 3:54:43| fishing and doing whatever he likes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14083)|
| 3:54:46| Can we object to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14086)|
| 3:54:48| You make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14088)|
| 3:54:50| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210513?start=14090)|
