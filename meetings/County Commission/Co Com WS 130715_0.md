| 0:00:00| Thank you, Mr. Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| I guess one thing to do as routine when you start out, just your name and your address and then you can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6)|
| 0:00:15| My name is William H. Curtis and I reside at 4407 Beachwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=15)|
| 0:00:24| As I appreciate this opportunity to apply for this position and I appreciate your all's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=24)|
| 0:00:33| this is an opportunity for me to continue if I'm appointed to continue some of the initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=33)|
| 0:00:41| and objectives that were implemented during my time at the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=41)|
| 0:00:46| These include, among other things, increased delinquent tax collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=46)|
| 0:00:52| both for real property taxes and tangible personal property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| The trustee's office delinquent tax collections were up $3,362,000 in fiscal year 2011 over fiscal 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=58)|
| 0:01:12| which is a 33% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| They were up 9.2% from 2012 over 2011, which was $1,256,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=76)|
| 0:01:28| Our delinquent or the delinquent tax collections for the trustee's office in fiscal 2013 have leveled off some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=88)|
| 0:01:39| but they're up $1,503,000 over what they were in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=99)|
| 0:01:48| The trustee's office during my time there entered into hundreds of payment plan agreements since September of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=108)|
| 0:01:59| which enabled taxpayers to pay their delinquent taxes, keep their properties out of the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=119)|
| 0:02:07| The trustee's office has treated all taxpayers the same with courtesy and fairness to each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| Currently, the trustee's office has 63 lawsuits to collect tangible personal property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| Three of those have paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Eight of them are now paying with agreed orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| Others are still pending in Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| I believe that I worked well with the existing staff of the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| many of whom were dedicated and capable career employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| I have a good understanding of the general operations of the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| and have no agenda except to operate the office with efficiency, fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| and in accordance with regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| I will not run for the office in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you, Mr. Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| If you would just hold it there for a minute, I'm sure there will be some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Not a question for Mr. Curtis, but a matter of procedure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| I thought Larry was going to get into it there a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| I think it would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| I know some of these folks in their resumes said they were only interested in the caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| And I think that those designated, you know, whether you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| or whether you're not should be noted in this interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Hopefully, they'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| And if not, we'll ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| We haven't decided which way we want to go yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| what improvements would you want to make in the trustee's office should you receive this appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| Well, there are always efficiencies to be had in any government office or private company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| And we would look at how we could improve our office, mainly in the efficiency of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=244)|
| 0:04:14| When John Duncan and others came into the office in September of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=254)|
| 0:04:26| we initiated quite a bit of savings to the taxpayers by hiring a staff attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| closing satellite offices in the summertime, and some staff reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| They also eliminated travel allowance that had been paid in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| So we'll continue to look at those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| And I'll meet with each of the department heads and we'll decide what we can do to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=287)|
| 0:04:58| This position, obviously, is one where a lot of financial knowledge, I think, is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| Would you just give me a 60-second or less about your financial background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| and what qualifies you to be the trustee of Knox County based on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| I was in the mortgage banking business in Knoxville for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| A lot in the bond markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| I've seen the interest rates at their highest and their lowest during the last 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| and we've managed to survive throughout all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| As you know, the trustee's office has some investments that need to be managed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| and they have a finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| and we look at those as to how far out we need to go with our investments and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| So I have a lot of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| In our company, we did business with Fannie Mae, Jenny Mae, FHA, VA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| so we had a good record with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| And kind of like Commissioner Brown, if you all forget, I'll ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| but I kind of have a standard question that I'll be asking each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| So if you want to address it in your five minutes, I think that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| General question, would you be willing to submit a budget to County Commission for not for approval but for review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=386)|
| 0:06:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Mr. Curtis, what's your feeling on the CTAS program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| I know some, I see Foster sitting there sort of jogging my memory there is some office holders have the course available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| to their employees and don't pay the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| And some office holders have it and pay the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| What's your feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Because I'm sure within the year that some people will want to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| What's your, if you had the office, how would you treat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Well, I would want to talk to the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| and see how they felt about the training and how much did they think it would benefit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| I guess to answer your question, at this point I'm neutral on it as to whether to have it or not have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=439)|
| 0:07:26| until I talk to our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| Would you pick and choose employees that take that course or would you just let anybody that wanted to take it take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| Probably pick the ones that I thought would benefit the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| Here's my personal view of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| It's a good program, but I'm sort of like Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| It's a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Let the people take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| And you get your bonus when you get your promotion because you've got that on your resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| So, but I'd like to hear from other candidates what they want to do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| I mean, it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| You can pay the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| But some office, I guess about more than half the office holders are allowing the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| but they're not paying the bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Okay, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| When you look at the history of that office, you have seen money going out the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| I mean, we don't need to rehash all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| What will you do to make sure that things are done in a proper fashion, that people are not paying themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| that you don't have money going out the back door, and that we have a sense of integrity brought back to that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=510)|
| 0:08:38| What would Bill Curtis do in that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I would plan to review the payroll every two weeks before the checks were authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| each and every check, each and every mileage report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| Would you consider working with the Knox County Finance Office of the payroll system through the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| Commissioner Hammond brought up a point there, and you mentioned about the mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| You, as a trustee, are allowed some mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| And, here again, some office holders don't take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Would you, and it's $750 a month, would you go for reimbursement, take no mileage at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| or just be reimbursed or take the $750?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| What would be your choice of the three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| I didn't know about the $750, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I believe that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Is Mr. Caldwell here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| I'm pretty sure it's $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Is that right, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| Somewhere around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Again, I wasn't aware of the $750 for the trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| but in the past I have turned in my mileage when I was out traveling on county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| and when I could remember to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| So you would just do mileage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Okay, any other questions from commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Thank you, Mr. Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you for your service previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| Appreciate you coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| William Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| Mr. Daniels, name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| William Daniels, 1505 Botsford Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| You've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Thank you all for allowing me the opportunity to appear before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Obviously, it's no secret that there's been issues in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| And as taxpayers, we tend to look at what goes on from our wallet standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| But what we miss is the employees that have been damaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| and have been harmed because of all the transition that's gone on in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| I'm a person who likes to look under what you see on the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| And one of the things that I did was do diligence by interviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| and talking with some of the employees that work for the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| And I'd like to share with you what I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| The employees feel they are working in a dead-end job with no chance for promotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| They feel they are in prison even when they know something wrong is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| They are intimidated into being quiet for fear of losing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| They dread coming to work but need a job so they endure the pain, put on blinders, keep their heads down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| and look forward to retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| They believe their opinions are neither important nor valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| They believe the morale of the office isn't bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| It's nonexistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| They fail to understand why the top jobs are given to those who helped elect, reelect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| or give money to those efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| They worry that they or their coworkers will become tainted or corrupt because of all the corruption that has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| Now, how many of us want to work in that type of situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| I don't think any of us do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| I've never had to work in that type of situation, but I've corrected a whole lot of those types of situations in my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| To rebuild the trust of the employees in Knox County, it's not going to take a strong leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| but it's going to take someone who has done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| Restoration of a group of employees is not something that's for the weak at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| My background has a great deal of diversity of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| something I believe the trustee's office desperately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| I've been educated with some of the greatest training organizations in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| and I'm going to bring that experience to the office every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| I'm not going to be an absentee trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| One of the areas that's been constant in my 32-year career has been being a leader that's given the guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| and helping companies emerge even stronger than what they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| and emerge from the mess that's been created either internally or externally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| My experience includes working for companies such as TVA, American Electric Power, Entergy, and Westinghouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| And I've served as a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| and process consultant for a tremendous amount of years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| William, we are trying to keep it to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| If you could summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I don't know whether you can see this above you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| It's not on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| I see it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| I'm sorry, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| On your second round, will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I'll cut it off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| I'll cut it off there, Tony, to help move it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you, Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Okay, commissioners, we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| I don't know if we addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I'll put mine and Commissioner Brown's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| One is, are you going to seek this office from an elective standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| And two, are you willing to submit a budget showing, you know, incoming expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| The last one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Budget, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| I don't know how we can have transparent government without showing the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| I don't think that makes a lick of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| As a former auditor and accountant, I can tell you that there's a reason you do audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| and that's to be able to show what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| So I think it makes no sense whatsoever to hide numbers from the taxpayers who are paying people to be in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| And the first question was, would I seek re-election or election to the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| That's one of those questions that I really have struggled with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| I want to do a great job for Knox County and restore that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| If I'm able to accomplish that, yes, I would seek re-election to continue what I've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| I think the office has a tremendous amount of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I think the employees have a tremendous amount of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| But it's not a position to where you fill it with friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| You give the employees the opportunity to earn those positions and not fill it with good old boy tactics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| So, yes, I would run if I'm doing a great job, and the public believes I'm doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Mr. Chairman, William, thank you for coming forward and presenting your credentials to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| You did say something, though, I wanted to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| You said you did not think that the trustee's office needed a strong leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| Did I understand that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| No, they need a strong leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I wanted to clarify that because I didn't hear that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| And tons of energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Secondly, what you have said here in your conversations with the people in the office is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| I guess the bottom line is they feel a lot of politics have been played in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| What will you do to try to take the part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| You can't totally do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| What, in your mind, needs to be done to take the politics out of the office so that we can get that thing straightened out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| The trustee themselves, obviously, is a political position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| Everything below that should not be politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And the way you manage that is by working with the employees, spending time with each and every employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| which I've done when I had 250 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| I spent time with every single employee without interruption to find out what was important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| When you do that, you remove the politics from the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| An office is going to operate politically if they think no one cares because that's what becomes a dog-eat-dog environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| The only way to fix that is by spending time with each employee, finding out what's important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| Some of the greatest turnarounds that I've been able to make was finding out that we had employees that were bad fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| for the position they were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| So the trustee's job in that particular instance should be to find out what makes that employee tick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| How can I help that employee to become everything that they were created to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| And the only way to do that is to spend time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And it's to coach and it's to train, not just sit in an office and collect a paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| That isn't what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| A good leader is a person who gives the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| They're selfless, not selfish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| And, unfortunately, we've had a bunch of selfish people trying to run this particular department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| And it's embarrassing and it's cost all of us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| And my last question, then, is just based on what you've said, is this position requires someone who has a strong financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| background because you're dealing with the county's money, my money, your money, everybody's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| So in 60 seconds or less, I'm going to be asking everybody the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Why should you be the trustee based on your financial experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| In my career, I've had to handle not only budgeting, but responsibility of over $500 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| So, yes, what the county brings in, I can more than aptly be responsible for and be held accountable for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1088)|
| 0:18:19| I've spent years and years and years budgeting and managing those types of figures that we see going through Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Mr. Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| William, tell me about your bill on CTAS and mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| As before, I'll do the last one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Mileage, I think, should, in my experience and in the studies we've done in the corporate world, it makes more sense to do mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| If I don't go anywhere this month, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for me to collect $200, $500, $750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| That's just a waste of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| The smart move is always to take the mileage and not for campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| That mileage should only be taken whenever you take an official trustee office business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| The CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| Training is something that's critical to any organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| If the training is not viable and does not help the taxpayer get a better return on their investment of what they're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| that office to operate, then it doesn't make sense for them to get a bonus for taking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Bonuses should be reserved for things that employees taking to better themselves, to do their job in a much better manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| than what they've been doing, or to educate themselves to be able to move themselves up the ladder within the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1176)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Any other questions, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Thank you, Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1190)|

| 0:19:59| Jamie Fromberger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| We'll go to Mitch Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Mitch Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Here it comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Just give your name and address and then go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| You'll be given three minutes for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I'm Mitch Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| My address is 5912 Barbados Lane, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Go right ahead with your presentation and questions will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Well, first of all, thank you for the opportunity to put my name out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| and get a chance to represent Knox County in this trustee position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1247)|
| 0:20:56| A little bit about my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| I've been in the financial services industry for about 17 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| I've worked with both large and small companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| Worked with big and small budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And one of the things I've always liked about being a manager, being a leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1276)|
| 0:21:25| is just that opportunity to support my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| So that's a lot of what I want to bring if I were to be in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| The opportunity to support the team and help folks grow in their own careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1294)|
| 0:21:43| I've always felt like that a good manager or a good leader is a person who is willing to support their team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1303)|
| 0:21:53| and be able to just bring a lot of good energy to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1313)|
| 0:22:13| That's really about all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Thank you, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| We'll have questions, I'm sure, from Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Mr. Hanneman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| I guess basically the same line of questioning from the others is I'm wanting each candidate to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| what they would do to help restore the trust in this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| So that would be my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Well, I think, first of all, you have to really get to know your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| and be able to, you know, find out exactly what it is that everybody is doing on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| support them in their roles, and help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| And then you just kind of bring everything together and help to just have to get back on the good graces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1374)|
| 0:23:06| I guess, of the public, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Make a good presentation of yourself and be able to present a good image out there for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1388)|
| 0:23:16| Tax notices go out the first of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Is this something that you feel you would be able to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| And along with that, if you'd give me a little bit about 60 seconds of your financial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| why you should be the trustee based on your financial background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| but also in terms of with the tax notices going out in about 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| That is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Do you feel that you're capable of spearheading that effort and getting that job done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| First of all, obviously, buy in from your team and your staff to be able to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| But, yes, definitely that would be something I would feel like I could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Basically, what I've done in my financial background has been more on an individual basis of helping individual families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| You know, helping them get set up for better financial success in their own households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| so that they can achieve their dreams and goals of being financially successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| So that's the same attitude I would bring to the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| It's just an ability to take a look at everything and see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| what we can put together to better handle everything in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Similarly, you know, Commissioner Brown's question is if you are successful at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| would you seek election of the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| And second, would you be willing to submit a detailed budget for commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| or some other public entities review, public review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| Yes, definitely would be willing to submit a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| I think that's very necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And I think like the previous candidate has said as well, if I go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| and I do a great job and win the trust back of everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| I would want to have that opportunity to be able to run for reelection, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Thank you, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| We appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| David Hadish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| David Hadish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| J.A. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| J.A. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| Rhonda Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| Rhonda Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| Craig Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1563)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you, Mr. Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Again, your name and address for the record and then go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| You'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Craig Luthold, 1320 Zachary Taylor Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| First of all, I want to thank you folks for allowing us all to come today and speak before you and to consider us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| I know that it's a difficult position to be put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| Just to give you a little bit of background about myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I'm fortunate to be married to my high school sweetheart for 29 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| I have three sons, two of which have graduated from college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| And my youngest son is entering in his junior year at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| a university that I graduated in in 1985 with a degree in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| A little bit of background about my work experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| Right now I'm currently employed by the Knox County Property Assessor's Office where I'm the public information director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| And one of the other duties that I do is I supervise the customer service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| I've implemented an outreach program where I go out and I go to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| and I tell them what we do here in the property assessor's office, the process of how we come up with those valuations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| I also even talk a little bit about other parts of Knox County, such as the tax freeze, tax relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| and how important that is that if you know someone or if you yourself feel like you might qualify for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| to get that help in paying your property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| I also worked in the trustee's office for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| I know how that office operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| I was a supervisor of the satellite operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| I had a number of employees that answered to me, and I think I earned their respect while I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| And I'll continue to work to gain the respect of all employees if I am so appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| You know, while I was there, I collected that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| I know what it's like to sit there and take that money from that taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| I also know what it's like to help someone get on those programs, that tax relief program, the tax freeze program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1705)|
| 0:28:34| which, by the way, when I was on commission, I was the one that sponsored that for commission so that we would have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| really good program right here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| Not all counties have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Not all cities have the tax freeze program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| I've sat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| I had a disabled veteran come before me, and, unfortunately, he told me, he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| I won't be here, and I need my wife to make sure that she's going to be taken care of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1738)|
| 0:29:07| And I helped that gentleman get his tax relief for a disabled veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| Unfortunately, the following year, his widow came in, and I helped her get on that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| So I know what it's like, the human side, of how to help these people with their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| because as important as it is to make sure that these taxes come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| and I know how to do that because I did that for 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| I know how to make sure that we have the programs to help those that need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1772)|
| 0:29:38| And that's what I'll continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I'll promote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| I've been promoting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| And I think it's very important that we continue to grow those two programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Mr. Luthold, the three minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I'm sure we'll have several questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| If that's okay, we'll go ahead with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Well, I've said them a few times, but the two questions, one from Commissioner Brown and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| From now on, I'll just say, for those that are here, if you could address the issues of whether you seek election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1804)|
| 0:30:14| And then also, would you be willing to submit a budget for public review to the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| or some other public entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| Well, in my view, this office needs stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| And to bring stability, I think there needs to be a chance of continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| And so, if I was so appointed, and if I felt like I'd done the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| If I felt like I'd have the support of the community out there, then I would seek the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| And a second on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| On the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| You know, having served on commission, I think that every budget ought to come before this County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1847)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| And, Craig, thank you for putting your name forward and to submitting to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| Mr. Daniels earlier said that he had talked with some people in the office, and I believe his words were that morale was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| non-existent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| They felt like politics had been played, that they felt like they'd gotten a black eye, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| from the community because of what's happened over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| So my first question is, do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Do you believe that there is no morale in the trustee's office or very little morale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| The office is filled with a lot of great workers, dedicated Knox County workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| and they deserve to have a leader that is going to be there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| I think that we need to, you know, when you talk about leadership, it starts at the top, and I'll be accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| I expect the employees to be accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| I think by going in and evaluating every employee and making sure that they are in the position that they need to be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| so they can be the most successful employee that they can be, I think that will help the morale of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| And, yes, it is very low at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| So in addition to the morale, what would you do as trustee to make changes in that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and bring back trust in that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Well, I think it starts with accountability and stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I think that, you know, I've talked about the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| It starts at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| The trustee needs to be accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| You need to be accountable for the finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| You need to be accountable to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| What the county trustee does is it collects that taxes, it accounts for those taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| and then it invests that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| And the only way to do that is through transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| We need to make sure that our books balance on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and to make sure that everybody has access to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| whether it be the finance department, the commissioners, the mayor's office, and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| And you earn that trust day by day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| It's not going to come overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| But we're going to have to work on that every day, a little bit every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| There are 25 people that have applied for this position, so in 60 seconds or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| Why should Craig Luthold be the trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| What's your financial background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Because that's what I'm more interested in is the financial background of each of the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| and what they bring to the table in terms of looking over the county's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Well, like I said before, I have a degree in finance from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| I've served on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I've looked at the county budget, which is a much bigger budget, obviously, than the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| And I've worked in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| I know how that office works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| I know where the money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| I've been on the bookkeeping side of it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I've worked in most departments across the, you know, in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| And just I think that I have the financial background to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Craig, you mentioned there that you work in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| How many years did you say you worked there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Sixteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Sixteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| How much of that time did you spend in satellite offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| I started work in January of 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| And from there until 2001, I was in there in different satellites from, you know, a few months at a time, off and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2064)|
| 0:34:36| From 2001 until I left in 2010, I was out in the satellites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| So most of your career has been outside of the courthouse and at satellite offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| At satellite offices and making sure that, you know, the satellite offices, at the time I left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| we were accounted for about somewhere between $25 and $27 million were being collected, those satellites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| And, you know, when you're out there, that money has to be accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2099)|
| 0:35:05| It has to be double counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| It has to go downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| And then that person, the head bookkeeper or the head cashier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| then has to collect all of the data coming in from them and make sure all of that balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| And then, of course, it goes back to bookkeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| And I've been a part of that process, making sure that at every step of the way, every penny is accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2119)|
| 0:35:27| When I balanced, I balanced to the penny every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| And that's what I'm going to expect out of my employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| Working at the satellite offices, did you have any suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| or did you make any ideas before to the trustees that you worked for over that time that came to fruition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| I mean, have you brainstormed and come up with any good ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Well, one of the things that I was very involved in is opening the satellite office at Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| It's been a great location to have a satellite at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| It's, if you think of where is the middle of the population of Knox County, it's shifted, obviously, from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| And it has shifted west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| And the Cedar Bluff office was, I think, a great addition to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| The other thing that I did was to make sure that we get money in quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And I implemented a program where we started depositing the money at the satellite location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| Instead of it having to come all the way downtown, then get counted, then go back to bookkeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| and then get to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| So we were now getting that money into the bank, start earning that interest on those tax dollars quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2186)|
| 0:36:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you, Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| If so may, since I make these presentations, I just wanted to hand out real quickly to the commissioners just a sample of the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| the people thanking me for coming out, if that would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Just pass it over here to Jolie and we'll get it and we'll pass it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you, Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Or Amy can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| Takes a lady, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Commissioners, it is nine minutes until the start of our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Just want to alert you that what I'd like to do, what we feel like the best thing to do would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| is to go ahead and open the commission meeting and then, without objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| we'll take a motion to recess and then continue our hearing of our candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| So that seems to be the most proficient way to proceed, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| So we'll do that at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Are we still having the pension workshop today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| We still are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| And it's been noticed as following the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| The next candidate is Eric Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you, Mr. Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| And you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Eric Luttrell, 800 Embarcadero Drive, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| I'd like to thank you for your time and thank you for the consideration for the trustee position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| I've lived here most of my life, and I've been able to see, at least through the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| what's been going on at the trustee's office in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| And I don't like what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| I see a lot of money going out the back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| I see a lot of people helping themselves to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| I don't think there's stewardship going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| So we need somebody in the trustee's office who actually knows to not help themselves to other people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| Commissioner Hammond, it's exactly as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| It's your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| It's their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| It's my money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| It's everybody's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| There should be some accountability there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| I have a bachelor's in finance from the University of Tennessee with a minor in accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| And I just got a law degree from the University of Tennessee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| I helped audit franchise fees for a multinational corporation for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| So I know how to find money that's not where it's supposed to be and bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2356)|
| 0:39:28| I've had to keep track of mileage in several of my jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| So I do that down to the penny and the tenth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| And it shouldn't be that hard to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| The primary concern I have and the primary reason I'm stepping forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| I have no ambition to run for this office in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| I just want to make sure that Knox County has a good, faithful steward of the people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| And I plan to use personal oversight, go through the payroll, check people's mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| If something looks funny, I'll talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I love budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| I'd love to put forth a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| That's very incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| If you're keeping track of somebody else's money, they've got to know where that money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2423)|
| 0:40:32| Three principles I try to live by and that I bring to this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| Things that I learned growing up, you've got to take care of what's yours and it'll last you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| There has to be prudent, efficient management of the county's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| You've also got to live within your means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| You can't go out and blow money on things like putting your name on the window when you can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| Or gold-plated pencil holders, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| But you've got to live within your means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| And you've got to keep track of that money down to the penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| And I would plan to bring a fresh, unconnected eye to this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Maybe I could see something that a lot of people who have experience in the office aren't able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| And I know not to help myself to other people's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| Thank you, Mr. Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| We'll have questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you for coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| And I appreciate your enthusiasm for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| This is not an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| So the fact that you're here before us today, I think, says a lot about you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| and your desire to be a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| I guess my only question for you is that you said you got your law degree last year and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| But of all the candidates we have, and we've got 25 people, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| from a financial standpoint, what makes you the most qualified person to be trustee as opposed to these other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| Well, from a financial standpoint, as I said, I have the degree in finance and accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| I've studied both fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I've had the academic training for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| And I got my feet wet working for Marriott International,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| tracking their unpaid franchise fees and billing money that was supposed to come to Marriott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| but people weren't paying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Mr. McKenzie, would you like to ask your questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Any other questions, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you, Mr. Luttrell, for your interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Let's have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| We'll have one more candidate, and then we'll open the commission meeting and recess, hopefully, and back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2574)|
| 0:43:03| Mike Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2583)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| Name and address, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| My name is Mike Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| My address is 8807 Ashton Court, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| For the record, I am interested in serving for the stub period, the appointed stub period only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| and will not run for election the next time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| The primary reason that I'm interested in this position is that the trustee position in Knox County has had nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| but bad headlines and bad news stories for the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| The one potential exception I can think to, can think of, would be when collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| where we were paying a third-party attorney $300,000, $400,000 to collect delinquent taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| We brought that back in-house, and there were some headlines about that being a positive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| and I believe it was, but I'm not sure we've really seen enough information to quantify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| I really wanted to give commission an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| One candidate who would bring a fresh perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| and had not worked for a trustee who has been charged with a felony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| I think a lot of good people who have worked in the office have applied for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| but I think those two legal issues appear to be somewhat open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| I think Trustee Lowe's legal issues are working through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| From a public perception standpoint, I'm not sure that it makes sense to appoint a trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| who might end up testifying in Mr. Lowe's trial about whether that person was aware of ghost employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2690)|
| 0:44:57| that might have been in the office in 2006 or 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| You know, Mr. Duncan's plea agreement, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| had a provision where he was going to cooperate with future investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| but there's been no public discussion of what those future investigations might involve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| I don't know if that would involve someone who has worked in the trustee's department or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| From a public perception standpoint, I have no history with any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| My approach would be to come in and evaluate the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| My experience in crisis situations, and I've handled three or four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| is that the staff in the office probably have 85 to 90 percent at least of the things that need to be done to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| stabilize the department and to improve the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| I am new to government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Part of my approach would be to seek out peers in Hamilton County or Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| and talk about what they are doing so that I can help get an independent perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| on whether what we're doing in Knox County makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| As far as my financial background, I have a bachelor's and master's degree in accounting from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| I passed the CPA exam in 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| I have worked in audit for two of the largest accounting firms in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| I'm a corporate controller for Radio Systems Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| I've been the CFO of the Rush Fitness Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Part of the reason that I am interested in this, other than just being a concerned taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| is that I am personally curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| I think as a fee office, it's very easy to set up the trustee position so that it becomes a part-time job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| because there's not a lot of accountability to the commissioner, the mayor, or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| If I'm appointed for this 12-month stub term, you know, my intuition tells me that it probably should not be an elected office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| that it should probably report to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| That is from the outside looking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| If I'm appointed, I will take a look at it from the inside and be happy to express an opinion publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| about whether the office should continue to be an elected position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| Thank you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Questions now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| I think you answered my question with your last statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| But just to be specific, then, so with you evaluating bringing it under the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| or some other executive, you would be willing to submit a budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Yes, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| You talked about the news headlines and what has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| So are there specific things that you could tell us that you might do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| or want to do to help restore some of that confidence in the trustee's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| You know, I think the biggest thing that someone could accomplish in 12 months is to not do anything stupid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| and to keep their name out of the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| And also, I'll ask everyone else, and I see, you know, you talked about your Rush Fitness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and also radio systems experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| But what expertise do you bring in, say, 60 seconds or less to the trustee's office that as people are watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2882)|
| 0:48:11| and as they see us vote, why should we vote for Michael Manning as opposed to any other 24 candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| given your financial background and your ability to do the job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| You know, I think several very strong people have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| If appointed, I'm happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| I think I have a unique background as far as having passed the CPA exam, worked in finance for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| I've taught a class at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| I have managed large groups of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| And I think, you know, I do not have government experience, which in this particular situation I see as an advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2919)|
| 0:48:48| And I think that, you know, I don't know any of you individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| but I think that in just about every case we know enough of the same people that you can probably call someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| who knows me and get a read on me as a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| Any other questions, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Thank you, Mr. Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Now, commission, it's 2.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| I'd like to open our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| And I would entertain a motion to recess so we can continue in our.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| So we're going to continue with our process as we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| Commissioner McKenzie, wouldn't you need to call roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| We need to do all that at the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2979)|
| 0:49:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Let's call roll and then we'll go into the recess for the 2 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=2989)|
| 0:50:00| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3001)|

| 0:50:10| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3010)|

| 0:50:12| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3012)|

| 0:50:17| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Commissioner Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| We have nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| We have just taken a motion and recessed our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| Our interview session for our trustee's interim position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| The next name that we have on the list is Marissa Moizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| Marissa Moizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Next on the list is a service member, Charles Ogden, who is currently in Texas and serving a country there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3052)|
| 0:51:04| I had made an offer to his father, who is here, who would be willing to take questions for Mr. Ogden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3064)|
| 0:51:12| If there's any questions, commissioners, you all can ask those of Mr. Ogden's father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3072)|
| 0:51:21| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Mr. Ogden, would you like to say something while you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Go ahead and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| My name is Charles H. Ogden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| The same is on the resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I go by Howard, and I live at 1115 Graywood Drive, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3101)|
| 0:51:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Go ahead, Mr. Ogden, whatever you'd like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| I think I can use this opportunity to brag on my son a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| He's a graduate of Farragut High School, honors graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| He was born into West Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| He abides by the code of duty, honor, country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3131)|
| 0:52:20| He's an Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| His son's an Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| And he went by the honor code that they wouldn't lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3145)|
| 0:52:35| Now, nor tolerate is kind of a hard one for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| That says you've got to turn somebody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| So his integrity is second to none in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| As far as his financial experience, he did work for Prime America and managed mortgages and securities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3169)|
| 0:53:02| and helped people out with debt problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| He did that on his own in addition to his service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| He's been twice to Korea and twice to Kuwait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| One of the trips to Korea was to install a Patriot missile system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| and he was sent from his country as a lead on the project with all the equipment he needed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3201)|
| 0:53:31| He's been twice to Kuwait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| His last mission was doing satellite surveillance over the Far East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| And he was putting in something like 12 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3222)|
| 0:53:52| And he is up to the rank of lieutenant colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| He has put in a lot of long hours, and he's very dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| As far as him running for reelection or when the election comes up, I don't know, and I don't think he knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3244)|
| 0:54:13| But he'll be retiring at the end of September to be separated from the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| and he will be looking for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| I think he's highly qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| I think he's honest, and I think he'll make you a good trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you, Mr. Ogden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| If I can answer any questions, I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| Okay, thank you for raising such a fine son, obviously, and we wish him well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3279)|
| 0:54:49| William Orcutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Name and address, three minutes, and you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| I'm Bill Orcutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| I currently reside at 1149 Kahiti Trail in Vaughan Ore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| I've also got a home in West Knoxville at 600 Hemlock Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I, too, retired military, came back to Tennessee a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| I've been consulting for Monroe County as we try to rearrange and fix their airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| which we have successfully done in the last four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| My military career is primarily in aviation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| but the part that I want you to know about how it relates to the trustee job is the leadership positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| I was a commander of a flying organization as well as a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| I was a commander and the dean of a leadership school in Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| and my last job before I retired was a base commander of a large Air Force base also in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3350)|
| 0:56:00| I retired in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| The leadership aspects of those positions, I believe, are what correlate to a lot of public offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3363)|
| 0:56:11| After the military, I went into private practice, if you will, in the aviation industry as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| As a general manager of several airports, CEO of a private organization that I originated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| and then finally for the last 10 years as a consultant for numerous airports around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| most of which have gotten themselves in financial difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| or they've had problems with their leadership or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| And out of 24, 25 of those airports, we've turned 23 of those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| The other one was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| I'm not a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| It's not my intent to be in politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| but I feel a strong loyalty to give back and to serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| I'm also not an insider, which may be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| It means I've got a fresh set of eyes coming from a different background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| and that may be exactly what's needed in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| What I do bring to the table is a good set of leadership experiences, both military and civilian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3442)|
| 0:57:29| And what I see is the need to stabilize the trustee's office almost immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| and to hold it stable for at least the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Would I make any changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Certainly not right away, but I would put in a great deal of study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and personal involvement with the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| I believe, as other candidates have already referred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| there's a number of those very good employees who are walking around with their heads down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| And so my role and my philosophy of leadership is to win in charge, to take charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| and I would do that almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you, Mr. Orcutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Questions for Mr. Orcutt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I guess, you know, General, would you be willing to submit a detailed budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Thank you, Mr. Orcutt, for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| But I have a legal question, I guess, is that we have to run for office in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3510)|
| 0:58:41| which should be the same as to hold that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| There is a residency requirement, which I know Bono is next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| but even though you own a piece of property here, that doesn't make you a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| The only exception would be if you were a chief deputy right now by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| So to hold the office, you have to be qualified to run for the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| and I'm not sure that you would make that criteria under what you testify before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| Can we get a definite on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| I mean, I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| You can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| So your primary residence is in Bono, or it is not Knox County, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| I, too, in order to work with Monroe County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| I maintain my residence down there more full time than I did when I was staying in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| That is now terminating in Monroe County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| So I guess the question would be registered to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| Where are you registered to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| I registered to vote in Monroe County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| Thank you, Mr. Orka.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| Drake Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3603)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you, Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| My name is Drake Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| I currently reside at 849 Walker Springs Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| First of all, I want to thank you for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| I appreciate the opportunity to come down here and at least give my input on what this position needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| I'll start a little with my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| I am a native of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| I've grown up here my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| I graduated University of Tennessee with a bachelor's in finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| and I'm currently working on my master's at Tennessee Tech with an emphasis in accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| My entire corporate career has basically revolved around the world of finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| My first job outside of the University of Tennessee was actually at the corporate headquarters for Edward Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| in St. Louis, Missouri, where I managed offices remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| For mine, at any given time, I was responsible for about a $200 million book of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| After that, they actually offered me an office to come back to Knoxville and manage locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| and it was a completely different situation, and I decided to pursue other careers in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| So that's where I ended up at Ed Financial, to where I was actually overseeing accounting for the Ed South Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| which is a local company I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with, with dealings with student loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| And so I got a lot of experience as a financial analyst there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| looking for various items that would stand out, that you need to question whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| or not money was going where it was supposed to go, general accounting reconciliation type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| Also, while I was there, I worked very closely with bank trustees that they had accounts for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo were the biggest banks that they had accounts with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| and I worked with those trustees to interpret language and bond integers, so I'm very familiar with the debt markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| as well as any of the financial literacy that comes along with being a financial advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| Recently, I have joined Pilot Logistics Services, which is a sort of new venture for Pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3727)|
| 1:02:14| which is also a local company I'm sure some of you have heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| And as a financial analyst there, it is my sole goal to analyze the financials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| and look for discrepancies and ways to trim the fat, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| I don't feel I really need the full three minutes, so at this time I will take any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Thank you, Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Questions, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| So, again, are you familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| I feel like a tape recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Are you familiar with my two questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| I would absolutely submit a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| I believe transparency is very key in any financial organization or government institution, any organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| And also, I have no intention of running for office at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Greg, I'm looking here at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| I'm not showing anything, voter registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I don't care what party you vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Either way, that's not a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| But we didn't show anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I voted for Knox County in every election I've been eligible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| I was a resident in Coryton, which is still Knox County, and I voted out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| It didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| You got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| I didn't have it in mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| It was in Dave's house, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| No, that's in Hamlin County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Isn't that right, Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| It just wasn't in my packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Other questions, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Mr. Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| Marion M. Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| Thank you, Mr. Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Name and address, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| My name is Marion McDonald Mack Pickle III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| I reside at 630 Sutherland View Way, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| I would just like to open up by saying let us not forget that the reason we're here is to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| and serve the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| So, secondly, operating for the benefit of the citizens of Knox County should not be a stepping stone for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3864)|
| 1:04:32| ambition as has been proven in the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Thirdly, at the same time, I'd like to reassure that should I be chosen for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| I will reassure the faithful employees of the trustee's office that I would look forward to working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| and empowering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| On a fourth note, I would like to say that I do have a master's degree in instructional leadership for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| I help empower schools, committees, teams, organizations, and whether a school, classroom, team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3896)|
| 1:05:04| or athletic department in the public service or in private business where I've been employed by both large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3904)|
| 1:05:11| and small employers, I have maintained and exceeded goals and expectations in my work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3911)|
| 1:05:19| I am a native Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| I graduated from Holston High School, the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| I possess a master's from Tennessee Tech University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| I am currently an employee with the Knox County School System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| So, I would personally like to thank you all as a recipient of the funds that you've generated for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| I want to thank you for your support of our marvelous school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| I'd also like to say that in looking at this job, I have considered what can I bring to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| And the biggest thing is that I'm a team builder and an empowerer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| We've heard much about the morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| We've heard much about the low esteem that we have in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| That shouldn't occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Every place I have gone, that place is better because I went to it, not because I'm the world's greatest gift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| because God has given me the power to be able to help other people see their potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| I see great potential in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| I see great potential for it helping not only itself but also the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3980)|
| 1:06:26| And so, I'll just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| As a Knox County trustee, my job is to make your job easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| And so, I would support and promote a transparent budget for you to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| and whatever I could do to assist you in the mission of serving the citizens of Knox County, I would certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=3999)|
| 1:06:48| Okay, thank you, Mr. Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| Okay, questions from the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| I don't think we have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Okay, thank you, Mr. Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| We appreciate your time, Mr. Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| Jay Marty Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| Jay Marty Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| David Shepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| David Shepler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| Edward D. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4047)|
| 1:07:38| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Go ahead in the same procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| It's sort of awkward being down here, but I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| Forgive me if I get nervous or talk too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| Ed Shouse, 1301 Wilshire Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| I'm a candidate for appointment to the Knox County trustee slot because I understand what goes on in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| I don't understand necessarily the ghost employees or the bonuses or any of that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4079)|
| 1:08:07| But I've been studying that office for five years or four years and ten months since I've been on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| I understand that that office has had a low cash balance of $7,044,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| and a high cash balance of $161 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| It has an average balance of $53 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| I understand that on 531, when the books closed last, there were $59 million in the operating account at BB&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4107)|
| 1:08:35| and BB&T paid 35 basis points to Knox County, earning Knox County $27,000 in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| I understand there's $29 million in a compensating balance at BB&T, earning no interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| but that's a good deal because that pays for our checking, our credit processing, our deposits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| credit card processing and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| There are 27 other accounts the trustee maintains throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| They have about $90 million in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| I follow the investments of the trustee's office because I help pick them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| because I'm on the investment committee, which you put me on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| And I thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| I know that the trustee has $24 million with Raymond James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| That's formerly Morgan Key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| Their investments, like the Bank of India, New York, $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| That sounds a little shaky, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| But it's not because it's FDIC insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Their investments just matured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| The City of Maryville, half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Huntsville, Alabama, San Antonio, all good investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| That's Knox County taxpayers' money being put to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| All the investments are rated AA1 or better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| $20 million is invested with PFM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| That's also the group that Chris brings in to analyze our debt each fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| We think it's the investment committee thinks it's good to have two people competing for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| There's $20 million, $3 million in T-bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| and $16.5 million are in federal agencies, Fannie Mae's, Jenny Mae's, Freddie Mac's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| This PFM paid us $15,000 in the month of May on our investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Combined with the $55,000 we earned from Raymond James and the $27,000 we earned from BB&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| Knox County made about $97,000 in May from our assets, our invested assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| One of the most important things that I analyze each month when I get to this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| these numbers I've been going through is something that's handed out to us each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And it's a public document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| You can download it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| It's the PILOTs and TIFs, the PILOTs being the payment in lieu of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| There's one on your agenda today, item 59.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| And the TIFs, the tax increment financing, there's another one on your agenda today, item 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| For it's the rehab of the JC Penney building up on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| They're borrowing $3,500,000 and they want $1,150,000 in TIFs from Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| That will be a liability to Knoxville of about $45,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| But I still think it's a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| And later I do plan on voting for that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| I know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Mr. Chauffeur, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I will just conclude and say I've managed people, I've managed money, and I've managed railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| I would welcome this opportunity and I'm here for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you, Mr. Chauffeur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| Yes, Mr. Chauffeur, thank you so much for putting your name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| And I don't think there's any question that you're familiar with the numbers because I know that we on this body have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| relied on you a number of times to help us with those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| So I'm not going to ask you to go into your financial background because it's pretty obvious that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| I was hoping you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Well, if you would like, I'll be happy to ask you that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| But I guess the thing that most, well, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| First of all, getting that office back on its feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| And I think that the employees, I want to say this, I think the employees are doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| The employees are, for the most part, are not the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| And so what would you do, should you be selected trustee, to go in from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| and to help establish the credibility and the integrity in that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| I, the office needs stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| That's been said a dozen times today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| You're about to appoint the, what the, well, Ms. Phillips, I think, is the fifth trustee in six, five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4337)|
| 1:12:25| You're about to appoint the sixth, and there may even be a seventh next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| So it needs to be a continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| Most of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Many out here know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| I'm a people person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| I'm not a harsh or an autocratic boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| I still have coffee cups in my cupboard for, let's say, boss of the year for my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| back when I managed people at the bank and the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| I would offer anyone the chance for advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| I would do my best to take politics out of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| I mean, I'm naive to say an office in this building, there's no politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| I mean, I'm not that naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| But I would do my best to take it out and give promotions and raises and so forth on merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| And I'd have an open door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| I'd listen to anyone's problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| I don't know that many people in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| I know maybe ten I worked with through on the investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| I think they're great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| They're professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| They do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| And I've heard some of their complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| But for the most part, they're positive and looking forward to continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| So I just try to be a good boss and not an autocratic person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| How difficult would it be for you if you need to let some people go to let them go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| Well, that's never a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| I hope that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| If I think the efficiency and productivity of Knox County could be improved by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| then I would move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| And my last question is, and I don't mean this in any way to be construed as negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| but it's out there and I think that I need to ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| And that is, you know, you're a member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| What would you say to those who would say you shouldn't vote for one of your own, you should look outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| and if you do select one of your own, then it's just kind of part of the good old boy network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| How would you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I would say this body, since January 31st of 2007, well, let me qualify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4449)|
| 1:14:18| Since the fall of 2008, I entered this body on August the 29th of 2008, so almost five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| It's the most transparent county commission, I think, in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| I would submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| And I would, I regret if it does look like good old boy politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| I mean, I haven't called any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| And I was even told from the law office there was a technicality I maybe could call and lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| But I wasn't about to do that, because to me that would be certainly violating the spirit of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| I haven't had people call you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| I mean, I haven't, you know, my guys from church and friends here and there, you know, we know how that goes, 20 people call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| You know, I know it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| I regret it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| But it's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| And if I could only ask, if you think I'm the most qualified for the position, then vote for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| And if you don't, if you think others are more qualified, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| I hope what I do every day will do this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| And what I'm confident each of you do is vote for what you think is the best interest of Knox County for the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| and citizens and put us in those seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| And that's all I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| I guess my standard two questions are, if appointed, would you seek re-election for the spot in that second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4528)|
| 1:15:36| Would you be willing to submit a detailed budget to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| I would keep the option open on re-election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| I can't say absolutely I would seek it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| But I would like to have the option open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| And, of course, I would submit the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Again, the transparency thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| I think these old salary suits are archaic and should have gone out the door with Black Wednesday, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| So certainly I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4566)|
| 1:16:11| Fred Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4571)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you, Mr. Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| Just give your name and address again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Fred Sisk, 1916 White Aram Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| I appreciate you taking the time to interview everybody for this opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| And let me get a couple of things out of the way quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| I am interested in this appointment as a caretaker only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| And the reason that I'm doing that, I respect the electoral process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| And so I want to give everybody that wants to run for the office in 2014 a fair chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| You know, I don't want to have any, you know, whoever gets it and wants to run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| you know, will have an advantage over any potential candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| But I think the reason that I should be appointed trustee is based on the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4633)|
| 1:17:19| and the knowledge that I have at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| I spent over 20 years in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I've learned that office from the ground up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| And so, you know, everything from pulling receipts to processing payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| And later on, you know, I became the deputy trustee and then the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| So, you know, I've presented reports to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| I also have helped develop the computer systems that the offices use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4661)|
| 1:17:50| And so, you know, I'm familiar with all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| And it's one of the things I can do is, you know, can hit the ground running tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| And as Mr. Caldwell will tell you, the auditors are getting ready to come in, probably be here early next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| Knox County trustee has got to be ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| So there are several things that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| And also, you have to get ready for the upcoming tax year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| I know what to do, when to do it, and why to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| So, you know, I respectfully submit my application for the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| One of the things that I would like to put forward also is I'd like to work with Knox County Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| And some of the things that I plan to do is I would like to hire at least two additional CPAs to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4708)|
| 1:18:36| between our office and county finance to help get those accounts balanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| You know, I think it's very, very important that, you know, we have that process professionalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| and as accurate as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| And I think with the additional personnel, you know, that will go a long, long way towards accomplishing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| Another thing that I'd like to bring to the commission's attention is when I left the office in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| we had 31 employees, that's including the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| And now the office has in excess of 45 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| So, you know, there's going, you know, if I am appointed, you know, I'm going to look at every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| But I believe the office can operate efficiently with 31 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| I will ask for the county commission to look at that, you know, and, you know, agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| And, you know, but I'll make the, you know, reductions in staff that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| So I'll open up for any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you, Mr. Sisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Fred, thank you so much for putting your name out there and for coming before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| and submitting your qualifications for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| As you mentioned, you've been, you were in the office 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| We've heard other people say that the morale in the office is probably the lowest that it's ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| So because you have been there for so long, you know a lot of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| what would you do to help restore the morale in that office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Do you think that you could, given the fact that you were the trustee at one point, you have been there for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| do you think that you would be able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| And the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Morale is all about respect, respect for what they do, respect for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| And, you know, during my time as trustee, you know, you talk to every person every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Any problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| And things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| You know, you ask them, you know, do you have any ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Anything's come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| And so you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| The morale when I left the office was much, much higher than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| And so, you know, getting the office back to where it was is, you know, very, very possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| You've said that basically you feel that 14 employees, the office could be more efficient with 14 less employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| You said 31 when you left, 45 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| Are these full-time or part-time people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| But the 31 is including the part-time people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| So you feel like that it could be run with 14 less people, but yet you said you wanted to hire two additional CPA people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| So what would these CPA people do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| I mean, I'm trying to get a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4877)|
| 1:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Part of the office is we have to account for tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| But Knox County trustee also manages the bank accounts for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| They're in the trustee's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| And so the accountants are balancing all those accounts, the cash flows that come in and out every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4887)|
| 1:21:35| Knox County Finance, through their accounting system, is making entries all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| You know, they'll probably make 8,000 to 10,000 entries per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| And that has to balance against the cash accounts that the trustees have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| And so working on that, it's a massive undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| And to be honest, in previous years, you know, we were understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| So I want to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| I think that is the number one area that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| This is a tough question, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Sure, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| But I feel like it needs to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Sure, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| And that is, how can you assure us that we'll be voting on this, and also the members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| that Fred Sisk is going to be part of the solution and not part of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| given the fact that you have been there for 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| And that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| You know, how am I the solution is I'm going to work every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| You know, I'm going to do things the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| When something happens, you address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| You know, I'm accountable to everybody, you know, the public, to the commission, to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| But how do you make things better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| You have to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| You are reviewed, you know, in every step of the way, be it commission reviews, be it the auditors are reviewing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4969)|
| 1:22:57| And also, I'd like to throw one other thing in that I forgot to mention earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| One of the things that I'd also, where we got in trouble in the past was the trustees fee and operating account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| What I'd like to do is have that account administered through the county finance as one of their funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| That way nobody in the trustees office is writing any checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| You're going to have to provide a check request just like any other office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| And that will take care of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| You know, back in the earlier time with the payroll, I was the one in the trustees office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| We took the payroll account and went to county finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| And we had the Knox County Payroll Department administer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| So that eliminated that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| With this, transferring the trustee fee and operating account up to county finance, that will eliminate that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5026)|
| 1:23:55| And so, you know, I'm trying to get the policies, the procedures, the applications set right during this one-year time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5035)|
| 1:24:06| So whoever does come in will have a clean shop and a shop that's ready to go for the next, you know, ten, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5046)|
| 1:24:17| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Reg, you've been there for 20 years, that you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| Is there anything you can hang your head on, an item or two that you've done that you've implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| or an idea that you had that you thought that other trustees implemented while you were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| There's a bunch of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| One of the things that I did that I'm very, very proud of is we bought a piece of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| come to the county commission, authorize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| It's called a remittance processing machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And what that does, it allows us to process payments that come in, you know, the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| When I first started working the trustees office, at the end of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| there were payments that came in that we would not get processed until late April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| You know, we'd hold that money for almost two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| And now those payments are processed the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| And, you know, we'll have a smaller staff now than what we did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| And that's probably one of the things that I'm most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5123)|

| 1:26:28| of why you'd like to be trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5191)|

| 1:28:26| Thank you all, candidates, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5306)|
| 1:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| Welcome to our July work session again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| We're going to go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| Mr. Sproles, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| We stand and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5349)|
| 1:29:18| I'll bet you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| Under we just called roll in our previous session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| Under amendments to the agenda, I'd like to, out of courtesy to Dr. Carsello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5366)|
| 1:29:33| and to the Audit Committee to add the item of their recommendation from the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| concerning our internal auditor to our agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| We'd like to postpone that until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| In terms of the Audit Committee's recommendation, that's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| So, any Mr. Schaafs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5405)|

| 1:37:40| That's one that I'd like to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| That is my wife's name, Sharon Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| She goes to the library every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| And I make no money off of that and receive no gain with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| That is my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| I don't want to disclose that is my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5870)|

| 1:38:16| Did you want me to include it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Because you didn't count them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| No, I didn't count them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Did you want them counted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5903)|

| 1:39:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| We could postpone six and seven also to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| I know Mary is going to be out of town next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| and Dr. Carcello is not planning to come next Monday either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| But hopefully they'll both be able to be here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Both of those will defer to the August meeting without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| And Ms. Pianky is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| You know, I didn't know whether we need to acknowledge you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5982)|
| 1:39:48| We usually do that at the big meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| But thank you for being here, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| The next item is number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| It's resolution 105, proclaiming Knox County as the first county in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| to be a Purple Heart County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Since this will probably be a unanimous vote, I would like to speak to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| As a veteran of the United States Army, and I'm not speaking for the other veterans here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| but I am speaking for myself, that I appreciate the administration of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| seeing that this is an available option for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| and express my appreciation on behalf of other veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| especially those who are Purple Heart recipients here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| and in the state of Tennessee, that they be so recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Let's do one more, and then we'll take item 60 up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| The next item, then, is item number nine, resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| It's appointing an individual to serve the unexpired term of Knox County trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| through August 31, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| I make a motion to stand without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6073)|
| 1:41:27| Page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| I think we have someone wanting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Are you wanting to speak to item nine, the one we just read, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Yes, I would like to speak to resolution 110, the trustee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6094)|
| 1:41:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Go ahead, Mr. Anderton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| I am D.H. Andrew, 712 Summit Lake Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| Folks, some six and a half years ago in this chamber, we witnessed this body embarrass itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6114)|
| 1:42:03| in all of Knox County in a manner that severely challenged whether Knox County was fit to govern itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| under the freedoms, the independence, the self-discipline of a home rule charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| Since that Black Wednesday of 2007, much progress has been made toward restoring the citizens' trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6135)|
| 1:42:23| and confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| This commission can be proud of its leadership role in progress towards that restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| Now we are gathered at an inflection point or a fork in the road in Knox County's progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6152)|
| 1:42:41| for restoration and regaining of the trust and confidence bestowed by we, the people who elected you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| Yes, you as our elected county commission do have the authority assigned to you to appoint an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| interim trustee to an office that badly needs restoration of trust and confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| That authority is explicitly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| I ask you to recognize that that mandate, like all others, carries with it the concomitant responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6186)|
| 1:43:14| that it be exercised in true faith and good stewardship of the trust and responsibility that the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| of Knox County have vested in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| Yes, we have vested in you a defined segment of our sovereignty for specific terms of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| That trust and endowment of sovereignty must not be taken lightly if Knox County is to continue its path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| towards regaining and rebuilding your citizens' trust and confidence in our first level of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6218)|
| 1:43:47| Folks, if you appoint one of your own to fill the vacant trustee's office, you will jeopardize progress made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6227)|
| 1:43:58| by Knox County since 2007, and you will squander the trust and confidence which you have regained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6238)|
| 1:44:08| since January of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| Now, some speak about a perceived advantage to be gained by the interim appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| In light of Knox County's recent history and current situation, focused on the trustee's office in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6258)|
| 1:44:26| this appointment will at best be a mixed blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| Indeed, if you appoint one of your own, it may more accurately be recognized as a proverbial albatross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6271)|
| 1:44:39| of political cronyism, a sure sign that you are leading Knox County back toward the politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| as usual system that blighted this county earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| Yes, folks, I strongly recommend that you appoint as interim trustee one of the numerous qualified applicants who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6291)|
| 1:45:00| not a member of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Sorry I omitted you in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| I thought I sent it through the channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| And now we're on page 17, item number 60, resolution 816.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| It's regarding the issuance of not to exceed $39,075,000 general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6322)|
| 1:45:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| Can I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Second, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Chris, tell us a few things about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Excuse my voice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| I'm suffering from sinus trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| So basically what we're doing is we're combining two issues, the issue in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6354)|
| 1:46:01| which you all approved at the end of May, which was $22,075,000 in the five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| We're doing that with the issuance of FY13 of $17 million for a total of the $39,075,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6368)|
| 1:46:19| Our advisors are here, financial advisors, Cumberland Securities and Joe Ayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| and he can get into more detail than I, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| What we are planning on doing is a competitive bid, and we're going to issue fixed rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6386)|
| 1:46:33| And so, other than that, I don't have a lot more to say unless you all have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6393)|
| 1:46:40| Okay, Mr. Shouse, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| One or two quick ones, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Does this still fall within the mayor's plan to reduce, even though you're going out for $39 million more new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6403)|
| 1:46:52| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| More than that's maturing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Yeah, there were a lot of questions, I think, as we went through the process about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6414)|
| 1:47:00| we were only paying down $22,000 in debt this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| Excuse me, $219,000 in debt this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| The reason for that was we combined that with the FY13 issue, so it makes FY13 look really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6428)|
| 1:47:16| and 14 not as good, but it's still $60 million over the three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| And by the end of the fifth year, we would have paid down $100 million on our outstanding debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| It's all for new projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Is it no refunding, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| It's all new projects, about $10 million for county projects and approximately $12 million for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| And that's just the FY14 piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| The FY13 piece would be about the same, I'm sure, in dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| Can you estimate an interest rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| Or can Joe give us one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| Just an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| I would defer to Joe for interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| They've perked up since May the 22nd, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| Joe Ayers, Common Securities, 813 South North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| As Chris mentioned, we're anticipating issuing fixed rate bonds over a period not to exceed 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| The bonds will have an average life of about 13 years in today's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| We feel like we'll be somewhere in the neighborhood of three and three-quarters percent on a fixed rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| going out to 2035 as the final maturity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| To be specific to Commissioner Shouse's other question, while you're issuing $39 million of debt combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| next fiscal year you'll pay off $39 million of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| In the following fiscal year, $41 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| So that is consistent with what the mayor has pledged to you all to continue to pay down debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| And with that, these resolutions, as you all know, authorization to general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| And by nature of general obligation bonds, you all pledge the full faith and credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| and taxing power of the county to the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| The first resolution, 816, is the initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| That's the statutory resolution that gets published in the newspaper general circulation of the county once it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| The second resolution, 817, is the actual detailed bond resolution, which is the contract between the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| and the ultimate purchasers and owners of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| One final question, I guess, for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| I've never really known how to differentiate this because the taxpayer picks up the tab anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6558)|
| 1:49:25| But you said $12 million of it is school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| And that's on our meter, right, and not the school's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| It's on our debt service schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| But we break out the school's piece and the county's piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| But, yes, it's all Knox County debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| It's all under Knox County's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| When we do the budget or you do the budget for debt service, will that come under or that break out for school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| We do break it out and we sit down with Ron McPherson, the finance director, for the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| and give them an amount that they pay us for their debt service for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Not on this issue, but I'll do it when you finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| Thank you, Mr. Ears and Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| Are we supposed to go back and have a couple of things removed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| We had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| That's what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| The next item is number 61, resolution 817.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| It's authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| and the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $39,075,000 in one or more series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6640)|
| 1:50:48| making provisions for the issuance, sale, and payment of said bonds, establishing the terms thereof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| and the disposition of proceeds therefrom, and providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6654)|
| 1:51:00| principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| We want to address Mr. Brown's on the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| Seventy-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6683)|
| 1:51:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6684)|
| 1:51:31| It's listed on Page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Discussion regarding the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| Go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| I need to punch a button or can you hear me there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| You just need to lean in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| I'm leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| On the everlasting arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| I know we have a meeting next week following the commission meeting, a public meeting regarding the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| so I thought it would be prudent to have Dr. Black come today to give us kind of an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| on where they are with their building and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| A couple of weeks ago, I was at the graduation for the, what do they call this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6728)|
| 1:52:16| Emergency volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| CMTs, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Crisis intervention teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| It was a very impressive ceremony, and the fact that we have these set up in Knox County now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| which is a combination of Knox County City and UT Police ties right in with what we're talking about doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6750)|
| 1:52:40| with this safety center because it teaches these officers how to interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| and to decide whenever they make a stop whether this person needs to go to the big house or the little house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6765)|
| 1:52:53| So, Dr. Black, if you could kind of give us kind of where you are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| I appreciate your asking me to come down to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| We certainly have spent a lot of time with Commissioner Broyles as well and a number of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| We've been talking about the safety center now for, I don't know, three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| So, I don't think I need to bore you with the concept of what it is and what it does and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6796)|
| 1:53:25| We can answer those questions, but if you have any other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| if you have questions that you would like to ask me or Jerry Bagnier, who is our president for the McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6808)|
| 1:53:36| I think about two years ago the county issued an RFP, maybe two and a half years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| for this safety center, and the McNabb Center responded and we were awarded that RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6822)|
| 1:53:52| So, I'd be more than happy to try and answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| My interest, Dr. Black, was that a lot of people don't know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| I think most of them on the commission do, but the public doesn't know kind of where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| Building-wise, that you have a new building available that's to be renovated, what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| that might take some of the pressure off of Amy's district and get everybody on board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6853)|
| 1:54:23| Yeah, I'd be happy to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| We operate a facility out off of Ball Camp Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| and that facility houses our crisis stabilization unit, our mobile crisis unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| and our medically monitored detox beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| And a piece of property became available, if you're standing in front of our property on Ball Camp Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6882)|
| 1:54:50| To the left was a former church that had gone into receivership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| and so the bank owned it and we purchased that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| I think the technical address is DeWine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| So it's about a 10,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| It's a metal-wrapped, metal-designed building, and it certainly is renovatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| And it's convenient to the center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| Do you have any, have you put out any feelers yet on about what it would take to rehab the building to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| useful for this purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Well, I knew you were going to ask me that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| And as you might imagine, I'm somewhat reticent to offer, you know, an exact cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6933)|
| 1:55:43| But it's going to be, and we've just done a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| We think we know what it would cost to rewrap the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| We think we know what it would cost to make it handicap accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| We think we know what a new roof might cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| But in terms of the details, we don't have them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| But it's going to be in the $60 to $75-square-foot range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| So I think the last time we went through this process, we were budgeting about $2 million for a 10,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6969)|
| 1:56:20| I think it could be half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Well, certainly, as I said, after seeing and hearing about the other program, I think they do dovetail hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6985)|
| 1:56:35| And I think that we can save the, over the long haul, save the county a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| by not having to take some of these out there to Maloney Road and house them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| and feed them and all this kind of stuff and pay for their medicines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| and all that where if they go through this type of center, they'll be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| their insurance will pay for it and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| So, plus, if you look at the officer's time, and I'm sure Brad could attest to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7016)|
| 1:57:03| the officer's time it takes to take one, bring them into here, get them processed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| and then to take and get them out to Maloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Well, I mean, the officer's off the street for sometimes a couple hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| So, this would take care of a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| So, I appreciate your input and your all's willingness to continue to go forward with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| I'm looking forward to next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| We're real pleased that Knoxville Police Department, Knox County Sheriff's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| UT Police have all participated in our community treatment teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7052)|
| 1:57:40| And so, we think that a lot of good things could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| In the paper, a day or so after that graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| there was an article that the city may be closer now than they ever have been to kicking in with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| Have you or maybe J.J. had any additional conversations with them about jumping on board cost-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7077)|
| 1:58:06| I have not, but we meet with them next week, the middle of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| The team from McNabb meets with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| So, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| And so, Andy, from a numbers standpoint, you're thinking that we had budgeted two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| You're thinking that we could probably do it for around a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| I'm not going to hold you to that figure because I know once you get into renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| you get into all kinds of issues and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| And it usually costs a little more than what you had thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| But you're thinking that in the realm of about a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| we could renovate this facility that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| I think a million dollars turnkeys it, you know, from furnishings to renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| And we have that budgeted, I believe, in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| We've budgeted a million dollars for this safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| So what other costs as far as the renovation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7141)|
| 1:59:07| You all would own the property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Yeah, we've purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| So we would basically be leasing that from you, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| Or how would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| That hasn't been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| So I would assume that when the county decides to go forward with this, that that would be a part of the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7159)|
| 1:59:27| So whatever purchasing in terms of Chris or Hugh Holt are going to put in the RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| or whatever you all are going to direct for them to put in the RFP is how we would respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| And that's going to be my next question, is that you all have indicated, obviously, a strong interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| And I believe that you may be the only one interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| But we do have to go through an RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| Yeah, I mean, that's this is America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| That's what you're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| So we compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| And if someone else wants to do it, it'll just make us better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| Competition is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| What would be the annual operating costs, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Again, I'm not holding it to it, but kind of a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| Ballpark is going to be between, you know, one-sixth and one-eighth probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| And where would the funding from that come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| I would assume that if Knox County is going to, Knox County, in your all's wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| have budgeted monies for the capital, that ideally what I would like to see is a combination of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7226)|
| 2:00:35| the city, and the state, at least on some sort of time-limited basis to see if the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7235)|
| 2:00:43| And we've had conversations with the Department of Mental Health, Commissioner Varney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| and as late as last week, and they would certainly entertain a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7249)|
| 2:00:56| Is there an opportunity for any insurance-type reimbursement or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| Yeah, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Jerry could probably help me with the numbers, but we run, through our crisis stabilization unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| we'll see 1,500 to 1,800 people this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| Sixty to 70 percent of them are going to be uninsured, and the rest are going to have some form of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| It could be public insurance or it could be private insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| But basically these people, if they don't go to a safety center, chances are they're going to the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7286)|
| 2:01:32| And so there's going to be cost involved in putting these people in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| or incarcerating them or holding them for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| Sure, and they're not just some of them are going to spend a fairly long period of time in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| But also it's my understanding that if they go to a safety center as opposed to going to the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7306)|
| 2:01:54| that they don't lose, is it their TennCare or their?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| They would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| They would not lose their TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| So that's if they go to the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| So you're thinking about 1,500 to 1,800 people a year would go through this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| Oh, I think more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| That's just on our crisis stabilization side, which is primarily mental health right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| I think when we incorporate this whole process, those numbers will increase significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7336)|
| 2:02:25| As I've said before, my position hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| I think we need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| And if for whatever reason the city says, no, we're not prepared to bring any money toward the renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7349)|
| 2:02:35| I think we need to go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| And hopefully if they came in and said, we'll help you with the operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| And I don't know how these discussions are going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| But my position is we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| And we've been talking about it for three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| It's time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| And so I'm ready to vote next month or whenever it's being brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| And I hope the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| But thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| And I guess we have to go through the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| but I'd be in favor of going ahead and voting and getting that out so we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| and get the ball rolling on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| But, again, thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Thank you very much, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you all for showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| Where you were looking at going before where your headquarters is now, and you were looking at that originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| you were going to house how many beds were going to be at that location versus the new place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| It would be the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| Same number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| Same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| Second, I've looked at the makeup of the committee and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| It's a great committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| You're pretty strongly looking at going over there on Oak Ridge, off Oak Ridge Highway, at that location, to put it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7408)|
| 2:03:35| Well, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| But, you know, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| We always try and meet with the community first, but we've missed that opportunity simply because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7419)|
| 2:03:47| the information preceded us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| So, but we would still meet with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| But we think it's a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| We think either location is a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Yeah, I don't have a problem with your location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| The item I have about it, Mr. Chairman, is the makeup of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| I think the commissioner, I don't know who the commissioner is for that area, but is it Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| I believe it's Mr. Norman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| I think he needs to be on your committee because you're eventually going to come back to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| I think county commission needs to be represented, whoever's district that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Mr. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| Yes, thank you, Dr. Black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| Is this a facility that used to be a church, used to be a gymnasium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| Is that the same one that's on DeWine right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| I don't know about it being a gymnasium, but it used to be a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| It was a gymnasium prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Yeah, when I was growing up, it was a gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| So the bed is still going to be around 18, is what we're talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| Yeah, 12 to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| You're going to break them out in several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| There will be crisis stabilization unit beds, and there will be medically monitored detox beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7493)|
| 2:05:00| And there will be sobering stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| So the sobering stations are going to be in the 12 to 14 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| Medically monitored detox beds are going to be in the 6 to 8 to 9 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| And the crisis stabilization beds are going to be in the 15 to 16 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| So I don't know, whatever that adds up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| I mean, I think this is something that we're going to need, especially with the closure of Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| And I don't think 18 beds is going to be anywhere near of what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| We've already seen an influx of problems in just the past year of the mentally ill that do not have the care out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| They're being turned away from Peninsula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| They're being turned away from Chattanooga, where they're being transported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| And they're right here on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| I think you answered the question, Dr. Smith, that I had about the community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| We're going to have to get with the community because that facility is smack dab in the middle of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7558)|
| 2:06:05| I mean, there's residential all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| But we need to do something for our mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| There's just ñ it's a shame that Lakeshore isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7571)|
| 2:06:16| But we're going to have to have some facility to get the care that these people need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| Because once they go to jail, then they lose their TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| And they can't get treatment after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| So I'm with Commissioner Hanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| I haven't been a supporter in the past because of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| But I feel that the state needs to put into the funding for it as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7594)|
| 2:06:42| And I would hope that they would follow suit and help out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| In terms of the current facility, we've been in that location now for, I don't know, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7608)|
| 2:06:58| So we have a real good relationship with the neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| And, you know, knock on wood, we've had very few incidences or issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7622)|
| 2:07:09| You know, and the city of Knoxville has been very open about talking and communicating with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| But they certainly want to continue to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| Ms. Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| I'll just let the mayor know that I wanted to be put on this committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| I have been on the Justice Committee from five years, I think, now that we've been working on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7648)|
| 2:07:36| So even though it's no longer going to be located in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| it's still something I'm very, very much invested in and really want to make sure it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| So I've asked to be put on that committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| And one of the reasons I welcomed it into my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| and we had some pretty involved public meetings that I want to throw out there for this other community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7673)|
| 2:08:01| is that, you know, this is really a medical health, a mental health medical facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| It's not a social services agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| It's run by doctors and nurses and staff with doctors and nurses, not social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| So it's not creeping social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| It's a mental health medical facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| And there is no shame in having that in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7708)|
| 2:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| I appreciate it, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| We're back on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| Item number 15, resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| It's approving a grant agreement in the amount of $840,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| It requires a local match of $360,000, which is funded by Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| and private sector partners with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| Local match funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| I'll move its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| I just wanted to ask a little bit about the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| I did several of us were at a press conference for this last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| Let me get a second on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Go ahead, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| Would you just tell us what you intend, what the Gates Foundation, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| specifies this is to be used for and then tell us about the match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| I think part of it is taxpayer dollars and part of it greater school partnership, possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| My name is Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| We're at 912 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| This is a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| It's a $1.2 million grant program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| As you suggest, it's $840,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| It will come from the Gates Foundation with a $360,000 local match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| The intent of the grant is to provide the Knox County schools with resources to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| and deepen the work that actually the conversation that we all have had over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7812)|
| 2:10:18| about making sure that we are efficient and effective in our use of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| and that we're getting the best possible return on the taxpayer's investment in public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7823)|
| 2:10:29| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| So I appreciate that that's been a conversation that we've had with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| and certainly with the county commission and the mayor over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| And this is a pool of resources that will help us to continue and to deepen that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7837)|
| 2:10:44| In terms of the specifics of the match, as I said, it's a $360,000 match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| The school board and the commission approved as part of our fund balance designations a month or two ago half of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| $180,000, and the other half has been committed to coming from the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| through its private fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| So we're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| We're excited about the program evaluation, the analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| and the great work that we're going to be able to do to continue to look at some very specific areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| that we've talked a lot about in terms of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| and how we spend our instructional time in the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| looking at people and some of the human capital strategies that we've put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| and then also looking at program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| And have we gotten the sort of return on investment from things like our investments in early literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| and special education and instructional technology that we've put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| And what are some of the highest value instructional initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| and investments that we can be putting in place for the years to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| to make sure that we continue to see the solid, strong academic progress that we've experienced in the Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| the last few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| Just one year, right, to be spent in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| Well, it's technically about a 15-month grant, but the vast majority of that analysis will be done in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7923)|
| 2:12:09| and work will be done in the next six months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| It will be in anticipation certainly of the fiscal year 15 budget development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7933)|
| 2:12:20| that certainly we'll all be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| But also part of the intent, which I'm really excited about, is really to help us to continue to build our capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| internally as a school system to do the type of analytics and to do the type of program evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| that we're going to be able to do in this time frame over the long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| and continue to integrate those type of structures into our budget development process going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| So, you know, and the other great opportunity here is that we just finished year four of our five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| And so at the same time we're looking at some of these and doing some of this analysis on our resource allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7971)|
| 2:12:59| We'll also be talking about and thinking about what the blueprint educationally looks like for the next five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| for our community around public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| And so being able to do those two things in parallel and to have that kind of alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| and synergy around resources and strategic decision-making I think is a wonderful opportunity for us as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=7993)|
| 2:13:21| and as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| That's all from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| There are two resolutions that will be before us based on this school request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8011)|
| 2:13:42| This first one that we have right now before us is about the consolidation of the bill of the Gates Foundation seed money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8022)|
| 2:13:52| and then the money that county commission or Knox County will be adding to it along with Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8032)|
| 2:14:04| The simple math is it's $180,000 from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8044)|
| 2:14:11| That rolls into what we have as item number 19, which then takes all of the money in one pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8051)|
| 2:14:19| and turns around and, as Commissioner Shouse points out, spends it over the next year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8059)|
| 2:14:31| I just wanted to make sure that these two were tied together so we know where the money comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8071)|
| 2:14:37| and where the money is going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| So are we talking about both of them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| We're going to get to 19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| I'll reserve my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| That will be the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8109)|
| 2:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| Item 19 is listed on Page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| It's Resolution 205.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| It's approving a contract in the amount of $1,200,000 with the Parthenon Group to provide professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8124)|
| 2:15:33| in support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grant to assess resource alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| and effective implementation of instructional reforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| It's funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8142)|
| 2:15:46| Motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Do we hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8147)|
| 2:15:48| I'll move the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| I also attended the last Monday afternoon announcement of this program at four o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| and as it was described by the superintendent, it would be a process as he has just presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8157)|
| 2:16:04| It would be seed money from the Gates Foundation and the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| Later on at the school board meeting, I don't know whether it was discussed or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| that there would be money from the Board of Education entering into the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8173)|
| 2:16:21| But that's the item that's before us right now, Item Number 19 or as it is, 205,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8181)|
| 2:16:30| whichever way you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| The question that is raised here, also by Mr. Shouse, Commissioner Shouse, is where's the money coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| and does it approach, then, my question, the threshold on which it has to be bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| and if it as we had a moment ago a request for proposals on the Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| was there a request for proposals on this particular item, and if there was, who were the bidders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8213)|
| 2:17:00| and then by what process was this particular bidder selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| That's the Parthenon Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| That's a rather technical question, but one that I'm sure that can be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| The second part of my question, though, is really not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| It's a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| What is it that we're purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| If you take the technology of the Internet and you look at the Parthenon Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8240)|
| 2:17:27| and I find them to be a global company, organization, or whatever they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8247)|
| 2:17:35| with offices in Boston, London, Mumbai, San Francisco, and Shanghai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| And what I say now is really tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| I've been to all those places except Mumbai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| I didn't really want to go there, but I do want to go to India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| So if I can visit this office, then it may be that, well, no, I'm not going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| The thing that concerns me about the Parthenon Group is that all of their white papers deal with how to get away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8275)|
| 2:18:06| from bricks and mortar, how to sell a brand, not a product, how to raise money in sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8286)|
| 2:18:16| how to get more money in baseball, skateboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| Tiger Woods has a $77 million contract and endorses Rolex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| The white papers that I've read, some of them actually have the Parthenon person and a second is co-written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8306)|
| 2:18:37| The other person being from the Education Industry Association, as I think I pick up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8317)|
| 2:18:44| well known on building models where educational groups raise capital, have funding models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8324)|
| 2:18:57| produce innovative solutions, and secure access to capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8337)|
| 2:19:06| The thing that I believe I read in the most recent white paper by the Education Industry Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8346)|
| 2:19:14| really is hardcore in how to move education from public education to private education using public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8354)|
| 2:19:27| I don't know whether that's good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| I know if I were standing in front of the governor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| the model in Tennessee would be that charter schools might be the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8380)|
| 2:19:40| If there's something wrong with public education, I think public education needs to be fixed and not farmed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8380)|
| 2:19:48| So those are my two concerns with 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| I just wanted you to know where the money was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| It's 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8400)|
| 2:20:01| Dr. McIntyre, would you like to respond to any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| So on the question of RFP, we did work with the Law Director's Office and the Procurement Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8407)|
| 2:20:14| the Purchasing Department, to make sure that we were in compliance with what we needed to be in compliance with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| In order to receive these dollars, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| pre-qualified certain technical assistance partners and required that one of those be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8425)|
| 2:20:34| And so in conversation with the Purchasing Department and the Law Director's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| that was deemed to be appropriate in terms of procurement as a condition of receiving these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| There were a handful of firms that were pre-qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| We did go through and work to identify the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8452)|
| 2:21:00| with what we thought was the best credentials in terms of analytic capacity and the ability to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8460)|
| 2:21:08| If you, Commissioner Wright, I know you're, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| fond of doing some research on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| If you look on our website, you'll see the work plan for this particular engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| And it's very specific about what the Parthenon Group will be doing for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| and what their subcontractor, Education Research Strategies, will be doing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8485)|
| 2:21:33| And it's very specific in terms of the analysis and the program evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| and the analytics that they'll be undertaking within this engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8497)|
| 2:21:40| So it's about making sure that we're as efficient and effective as we can be in public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8500)|
| 2:21:48| in our community, making sure we're making, as we've talked about with this body several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| making sure that we're making the best possible investments that we can that are going to get the best possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| educational return for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| So I think it's very specific with regard to what the work plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8520)|
| 2:22:09| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8529)|
| 2:22:10| Thank you, Mr. Aaron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8530)|
| 2:22:13| Dr. McIntyre, you answered most of my questions as far as who the Parthenon Group was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8533)|
| 2:22:20| But I guess, so maybe I'll make a statement you can either agree with or disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8540)|
| 2:22:27| The tangible outcome of this process will be a series of steps for you and the board to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8547)|
| 2:22:38| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| Yeah, recommendations or options for the Board of Education to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| And also, again, I think the technical assistance that will help really bolster our capacity as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| to continue to do those types of analyses after this engagement is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| So is this lining up with the 100-90-90 strategy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8579)|
| 2:23:06| Is this lining up with or is it more so lining up with in a ever shrinking, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| stagnant budgets and cost increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| What aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| Are we looking at pupil outcomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| Are we looking at operational efficiencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| What are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| We're looking at how do we use the dollars that we that are available to us in the Knox County schools as efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| and effectively as possible to get the best possible outcomes in terms of student learning and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8613)|
| 2:23:38| And, you know, I think, again, if you go through and look at the work plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| it's very specific about some of the strategies that I outlined in terms of looking at some of the areas of how we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| or utilize our time, how we develop and utilize our people, and the investments that we've made programmatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8629)|
| 2:23:57| and that we could make programmatically in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| So it's a pretty detailed work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| It's pretty specific in terms of what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| And so the short-term outcome is some options and potential recommendations around fiscal year 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8645)|
| 2:24:12| The longer term, I think, outcomes are building capacity so that we can do some of this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8652)|
| 2:24:19| or continue to do some of this work and have some of this capacity to do the analytical work over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8659)|
| 2:24:27| And then I think, again, a real significant side benefit is that we're doing this at the same time we're creating our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| So as we're having conversations with key stakeholders like county commissioners, parents, community members, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8675)|
| 2:24:43| students in developing and the Board of Education, working with the Board of Education to develop the next five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| strategic plan, these types of analyses can inform that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8688)|
| 2:24:54| And I think it can be a real powerful in terms of being able to align our resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8694)|
| 2:25:01| with the strategic direction that we're developing at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| And then I guess my last question that kind of dovetails into what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8706)|
| 2:25:12| We're going to do some things with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| But I guess in terms of over the lifetime of this $1.2 million process project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8714)|
| 2:25:23| what are our costs associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| I mean, we're going to have to couple up with these folks, these advisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| Is that captured anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| There's going to be, you know, office space that's going to just kind of nuts and bolts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| What's our piece of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| I mean, I know we're giving, you know, $180,000 Great School Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| Are there other costs that we have, administrative costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8743)|
| 2:25:46| Are we applying staff to coordinate with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| Oh, we're absolutely applying staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8750)|
| 2:25:50| I mean, we're absolutely the biggest cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| There might be some nominal costs in terms of some of the activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| but really the bulk of what this engagement is going to look like is certainly within the $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8758)|
| 2:26:10| I think there might be some minor things outside of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| except for, you know, a significant investment will be in the time of some of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8772)|
| 2:26:19| You know, we're going to have our folks interacting significantly with the folks both from Parthenon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| and from ERS and working with them to help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| think through what the data says to make sure that they have the appropriate context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| when they're doing some of this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| So, yeah, there's a significant staff time component to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| but those are sort of already embedded costs in our budget and in our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8802)|
| 2:26:48| And, again, this is about making sure we're using our resources as efficiently and effectively as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| That's a strong interest on the part of the school board and certainly from our conversations with this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8813)|
| 2:27:01| and with the mayor, that's of strong interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| So, you know, the fact that we are here and accepting one of four school systems in the nation, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8825)|
| 2:27:12| that have been selected for this grant project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| I think it's certainly a wonderful opportunity for us to continue that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| and to deepen that conversation that's so important to everyone around this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| everyone on the school board, and I think everyone in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| to make sure that every dollar and every dime that we have that we're investing in kids in public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| we're getting the best bang for that buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| You know, I'd just really like to make an observation here, I think, in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8867)|
| 2:27:52| I realize that this money is tied into the money coming from the Gates Foundation, et cetera, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8872)|
| 2:27:59| But why is it that we have to spend $1,200,000 to have somebody from Podunk, Iowa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8879)|
| 2:28:11| come in and tell us what's wrong with our system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| Why don't we have $200,000 professionals that you have over there across the street that can figure this stuff out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| Do we not have anybody that smart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| Is that a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| The end of it was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| Yes, we certainly do have some pretty intelligent people who have been working hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8910)|
| 2:28:35| and doing a lot of, I think, great work around resource allocation and efficiency and effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| I think having the support of the Gates Foundation and some really very expert organizations in the effective use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8921)|
| 2:28:56| resources in public education simply adds credibility and allows us to continue, as I've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8936)|
| 2:29:02| to continue and extend and deepen some of the work that we've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8942)|
| 2:29:07| Part of the challenge, as you know, is we have a fairly, despite what some of the perceptions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8947)|
| 2:29:14| we have a fairly lean organization in the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| And so the folks who are doing the day-to-day work of directing and supervising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| and supporting the work in our schools are also the folks who have to do the analytics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8964)|
| 2:29:29| and the program evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| And so having some additional analytical horses, some additional help to do that, I think is certainly useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8971)|
| 2:29:38| But I think having the support and the credibility that a third-party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| independent perspective brings I think is also very powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| And I've heard that from people around this table, that that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| So, you know, I think it's useful to bring in sometimes an outside perspective to help make sure that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| under every stone, to make sure that we're looking at every possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| and every option to be as efficient and effective as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| Well, I would agree to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| But, I mean, I think that we have to utilize the resources that we have on hand, that you have on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9006)|
| 2:30:13| You talk about experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| I mean, you've got people over there that are 25, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| If they're not experts by now, then we need to be replacing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| But this is just one instance where we go outside and pay a lot of money to have somebody come in and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| Which we're going to get into here in the next couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| So I'll reserve the rest of my comments until we get down to computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| Yeah, I think the beauty of this engagement is what Commissioner McKenzie asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| is that this just isn't someone coming from the outside to do something to us or for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| This is a group that's going to work with us to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9045)|
| 2:30:48| Really, I think part of what was attractive to the Gates Foundation about the Knox County Schools is that we're not starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| from ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| We're not starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| We've been having this conversation for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| We did an extensive 100-page return on investment report last year that was very sophisticated by our people internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9059)|
| 2:31:07| But we recognize that there's more that we can do and that we should do around making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| that we're doing everything we possibly can to ensure that we're as efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| and effective as we possibly can be in the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| But I still lost my welding house outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9080)|
| 2:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9087)|
| 2:31:28| Ms. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9088)|
| 2:31:30| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9090)|
| 2:31:31| I haven't had a chance to talk to India about this yet, so I don't want to make too many remarks until I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9091)|
| 2:31:36| But I would like to meet with you later in the week after I have an opportunity to speak with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| Something that raised a couple of red flags for me is that there were groups that were pre-selected that you had to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9101)|
| 2:31:48| Because I'm wondering if all of them have as their main thrust a desire to privatize public school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9108)|
| 2:31:57| if that was a requirement for any group that the Gates Foundation pre-selected for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| And I wonder how much that's going to feed into what the recommendations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9123)|
| 2:32:08| Commissioner, I'd suggest that that is not an accurate characterization of the Parthenon group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| If you take a closer look at the work that they've done and the materials that they've put out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| I would not say that's a major thrust of their organizational identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| At the stuff I've looked at, that seems to be kind of what it does appear to be, as speaking as a parent and a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9147)|
| 2:32:35| That's something I'm very concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| And I know that there's a push in our legislature and from our governor to do vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9157)|
| 2:32:44| and to expand charter schools in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| So this just is one more worrisome thing for me as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| But, like I said, I haven't discussed it with India yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| But after I do, I'd like to meet with you maybe later this week and talk about it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9181)|
| 2:33:02| A couple of things for me, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Would you all provide contact information for educational research strategies and Parthenon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9184)|
| 2:33:12| Just give me contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| Just e-mail it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| And then the other one is, in our budget process, especially in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9197)|
| 2:33:25| the issue of teachers and teacher morale is still very, very much dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9205)|
| 2:33:33| And I do welcome third-party looks at the schools and how operations, how we do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9213)|
| 2:33:43| Would that be an aspect of any of the analytics that these two organizations do in this use of these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9223)|
| 2:33:56| To try to measure teacher morale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| No, I don't believe that's in the work plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| Was that a consideration within the work plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| You know, I think one of the challenges is measuring morale, you know, teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| It's a, I'm not aware of any reliable, quantifiable metric out there that looks at teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9251)|
| 2:34:21| There are lots of, you know, what we do have is we have some information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| and they're certainly going to look at it as are we when we begin to look at strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9266)|
| 2:34:30| is the TEL survey that we do biannually in the state of Tennessee to get some information from teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| But, no, I'm not aware of any instruments or metric out there that seeks to reliably measure teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9277)|
| 2:34:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9301)|
| 2:35:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| Now we're on Item 22, Resolution 208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| It's approving a contract in the amount of $1,706,300 with Follett Software Company for the provision of a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9311)|
| 2:35:20| information system, SIS, funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| Hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9329)|
| 2:35:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| The reason I asked for this one to be pulled, I would like to know if it is tied in with Number 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| which is the master lease purchase of about $6 million for computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9342)|
| 2:35:47| That's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9347)|
| 2:35:48| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| What is a student information system, and why does it cost a million and three quarters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| A student information system is the system, the information system that we use to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9355)|
| 2:36:03| and support all student data from attendance to grades to information that's required to be reported to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9363)|
| 2:36:13| state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| It's basically our backbone information system in the school system, and our current system is becoming obsolete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9374)|
| 2:36:21| within the next 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| So we went through a procurement to put a new one in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9384)|
| 2:36:30| So it's not tied in to 26 or 212?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| No, sir, not directly, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| Okay, other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9397)|
| 2:36:38| Is this an update of the previous system, Follett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| Yeah, it's a, well, it's a, it would be a new student information system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| So the previous contractor for SIS was Follett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9410)|
| 2:36:54| I don't know that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9417)|
| 2:36:58| In fact, I don't think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9418)|
| 2:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| Okay, do you know who that was, who the previous contractor was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| I don't, but I can certainly get the name for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Maybe Mr. Oakes has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| And I'm assuming this was RFP 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9436)|
| 2:37:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| Century Starbase is a previous contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| So they did the star student system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9452)|
| 2:37:38| Page 6, item 23, resolution 209,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| approving a contract in the amount of $220,000 plus reimbursable expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| for the design of a CTE magnet high school to be located within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| Pellissippi State Community College facility located at 7201 Strawberry Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9471)|
| 2:37:57| funded in current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| This is $220,000 to study having a new high school at Strawberry Plains Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9487)|
| 2:38:20| This is for the design and the internal design at the Pellissippi State campus there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9500)|
| 2:38:29| Architectural design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9513)|
| 2:38:34| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| This is for the design for the space at Pellissippi State Community College Strawberry Plains Campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| for a new career and technical education magnet high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9521)|
| 2:38:51| I'm getting assistance here saying how many square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| That doesn't bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| The question that I guess I'm going to get at, and I have spoken to Mike McMillan about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9536)|
| 2:39:03| a member of the Board of Education, and he was unable to answer some questions that I had about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9543)|
| 2:39:10| And let me back up for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| I attended the ribbon cutting at that location on Strawberry Plains announcing that the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9552)|
| 2:39:21| through Pellissippi State, was going to have educational resources presented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9561)|
| 2:39:30| And that, Dr. McIntyre, that is the location we're talking about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| They're co-located with Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9574)|
| 2:39:37| At Pellissippi State's Strawberry Plains Campus, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| Right, the former North American Phillips location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| At that ribbon cutting, I was enthused by the prospects that there could be classes offered there that would be joint credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9586)|
| 2:39:55| In other words, the high school students in Knox County, maybe juniors but probably seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9595)|
| 2:40:02| could do some high school work at their high school and then be transported, transport themselves to this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9602)|
| 2:40:10| and do college-level work, or post-secondary work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| thereby easing the transition between high school and post-secondary education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9616)|
| 2:40:25| I thought that to be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| In fact, I thought it would be an exceptional idea because they exist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| They're not going to take up all their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| This is Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9633)|
| 2:40:38| But now, a little over, maybe it's a year later, I don't know how much later this is than the ribbon cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9638)|
| 2:40:45| but as Commissioner Brown suggested a moment ago, he lost something at South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9645)|
| 2:40:53| Maybe something has gone away at Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| I believe Board of Education member Dethridge asked the question if this would affect Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9657)|
| 2:41:04| and that career and technical education from Austin East might be moving to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9664)|
| 2:41:10| I think she was assured that that would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| But really, let me get back to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| This is, as I hear, the high school is going to be 125 people in the fall of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9677)|
| 2:41:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| 125 freshmen the fall of 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9692)|
| 2:41:33| That's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| And then the rest of this, I'm guessing, is going to be adding a class each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9694)|
| 2:41:43| so that the high school eventually comes to a head count of maybe 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9703)|
| 2:41:50| That being the case, the dollar value of the bottom line of the Board of Education's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9710)|
| 2:41:58| if attendance in Knox County stays flat, does that mean that this location has no cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9718)|
| 2:42:07| Because we have no more head count in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9727)|
| 2:42:10| I'm trying to make an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| We can say attendance in Knox County goes up 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| Then we know that Knox County's educational costs are going to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9735)|
| 2:42:20| But if the head count in Knox County stayed flat, would there be an increase in the cost of education in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9740)|
| 2:42:29| because this school pulls attendees from other schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9749)|
| 2:42:37| In other words, there may be someone from Austin East or Gibbs or Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9757)|
| 2:42:46| I shouldn't start naming schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| There may be students that will attend this new high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| Will that mean that the cost of these schools where they come from stays the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9774)|
| 2:43:00| Or if the head count in Knox County stays flat, then the expense in these other schools will go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9780)|
| 2:43:07| and will then cover the expense of the new high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| And generally speaking, with our magnet schools, like with the L&N STEM Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| we have an enrollment-based funding formula, an enrollment-based staffing formula that we use for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9796)|
| 2:43:22| So generally speaking, the dollars or more precisely the staff would typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| or the positions would typically follow the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9807)|
| 2:43:32| But there would be a net increase in cost because there are some fixed costs with providing an additional site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9812)|
| 2:43:41| such as there would be a principal of this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| There would be a presumably a school secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| There would be some security costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| And because this is a specialized program, there would likely also be some instructional costs that would go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9830)|
| 2:43:57| We want this to be, and I think we've developed a truly outstanding partnership with the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9837)|
| 2:44:03| and with Pellissippi State so that we can make this an extremely high-quality educational opportunity for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9843)|
| 2:44:10| But it may mean there's some net additional cost in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9850)|
| 2:44:14| It may mean an additional career and technical education teacher or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| It may mean we need to have a magnet coordinator there to be able to facilitate the internships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9858)|
| 2:44:26| and the mentorships with industry and the dual enrollment that occurs between our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9866)|
| 2:44:31| and Pellissippi State Community College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| So there may be some net additional cost that we'll have to embed into the fiscal year budget that we develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9873)|
| 2:44:40| and obviously comes before you for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| But the idea here is to provide, is to really add to the opportunities for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9883)|
| 2:44:50| that we're going to provide career and technical education in four areas, four courses of study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9890)|
| 2:44:59| which include advanced manufacturing, sustainable living, homeland security, and teacher preparation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9899)|
| 2:45:05| and that we're going to be able to partner with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| And those, by the way, those came out of conversations with Pellissippi State Community College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| and with leaders of industry that we've been able to talk with through the partnership with the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9913)|
| 2:45:21| And those have been great conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| Those are four areas where, looking to the future, there are high-demand, high-skill, high-wage jobs for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9923)|
| 2:45:31| And, you know, the Board of Education strongly believes in the philosophy of multiple pathways to success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9931)|
| 2:45:38| that every kid can be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| Every child in the Knox County Schools can find success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| but there need to be multiple options and multiple pathways to get there because each kid is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9943)|
| 2:45:48| Each child has different learning styles, different needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9948)|
| 2:45:51| and so we want to make sure we have multiple pathways to be able to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| And this truly fits with that philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| And I think it's, you know, it's something we've, again, talked a lot about over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9959)|
| 2:46:06| looking for additional opportunities in career and technical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| It's actually in the strategic plan that the Board of Education adopted in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9969)|
| 2:46:14| says we'll seek to develop a career and technical education magnet or charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| So we're fulfilling some of the promise of what we said strategically we were going to do over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9980)|
| 2:46:27| And I think it's going to be a great opportunity for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9993)|
| 2:46:35| As we named off the expenses, one that was left out would be transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=9995)|
| 2:46:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10000)|
| 2:46:41| Is that if a student bids on a seat at this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10001)|
| 2:46:54| and is successful in being admitted, is transportation included in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| I forgot what happened on the STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| Yeah, it typically is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10021)|
| 2:47:02| I believe we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| With STEM, we did some sort of unique transportation structures so that we would be able to make it as efficient as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10023)|
| 2:47:12| But, yes, we provide transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| Students, we provide transportation basically from the other district high schools to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10035)|
| 2:47:21| And if you remember, the STEM Academy starts later than our other high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10041)|
| 2:47:25| So it's a little bit of a different transportation pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| And then on the way home, we provide transportation sort of out from the center like spokes to various parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10048)|
| 2:47:36| And so it's not necessarily door-to-door transportation, but we do provide transportation to students who attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10056)|
| 2:47:44| Now then, I have to continue on with trying to get myself up to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10064)|
| 2:47:49| and that I've got to go back to something that's before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS130715?start=10069)|
