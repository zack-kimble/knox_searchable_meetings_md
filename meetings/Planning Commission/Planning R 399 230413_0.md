| 0:14:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=846)|
| 0:14:31| We will now move to agenda item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| The applicant, Chris Burkhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Location, north side of Nash Road, east of Pelham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| Approximate size of track, 1.22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Present plan and zoning designation, low density residential, hillside protection, single family residential, and hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=888)|
| 0:14:59| Proposed plan designations, hillside protection and light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| Existing land use, single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| First motion, staff recommendation, deny the sector plan amendment to light industrial classification because it would be an encroachment of incompatible land uses into an established residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=919)|
| 0:15:37| The second motion, one year recommendation, would be deny the one year plan amendment to the light industrial land use classification because it would be an encroachment of incompatible land uses into an established residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=937)|
| 0:15:57| Third motion, staff recommendation, deny general industrial zoning because it conflicts with the sector plan and with the intent of the IG district as described in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=957)|
| 0:16:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant, Chris Burkhart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Seeing no opposition, please proceed, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| This is a rezoning request that Mr. Burkhart made for two lots, 0 Old State Road and 299 Nash Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=991)|
| 0:16:40| The purpose of this request is to allow there to be a common access driveway across these lots that will serve the existing industrial zoning to the north and the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1000)|
| 0:16:56| I just passed out some documents that I will be referring to during the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| The first one is an email that I sent on Monday to Ms. Hillman and Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| This was brought up during the agenda review that we wanted to revise our zoning request to basically make the southern edge of the zoning request for the 299 Nash Road match the southern boundary line of 0 Old State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1026)|
| 0:17:21| Therefore, it wouldn't be pushing that industrial zoning up the hill to the south towards Nash Road, which would address any concerns that this would introduce potentially industrial traffic onto Nash Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1041)|
| 0:17:34| Again, the purpose of this zoning is really necessitated simply because of the need to do a common access driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| Back in May 2022, and this is the second page in the handout I gave you, there was a concept plan approved for a closure of the existing Pelham Road right-of-way and the creation of a Rock Point Drive right-of-way that will go a little bit further to the south and then connect to the intersection where Pelham Road curves up the hill towards the south and then kind of stub out just to the west of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1061)|
| 0:18:10| That was approved and they're underway in getting that road constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| Since that time, they have, and this is the third page, they're moving forward with connecting that stub out to a private drive that would then stretch from where the stub out is on Pelham Road all the way to Spring Hill Lane, which is going to be a common access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1097)|
| 0:18:37| It's not going to be a public road, but a private road serving those industrial tracks there that are on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| That's necessary, and I gave staff engineering comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| If you look at the third page or fourth page, comment number nine says the primary use is located in the IG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1128)|
| 0:18:57| You either have to reroute the driveway to remain in the IG zone or rezone parcel number 071A0201 to IG, which is the purpose of the request before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1137)|
| 0:19:09| There have been changing conditions which would warrant a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| The introduction of this new road and this common access driveway to serve this property is a changing condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| This property has been built up for the last 30 years by Mr. Burkhardt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| It used to be an old quarry and was used for a borrow pit for the interstate when it came through, and it was set kind of vacant for years until it was built up and then put on the tax rolls as an industrial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1166)|
| 0:19:39| This is just a further extension of the redevelopment of this entire area, which has been ongoing for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| You look at the property there, and while there is still a portion that is zoned residential, most of the property to the north, to the east, and to the west right now is zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1187)|
| 0:19:59| So it's a minor extension of the existing sector plan and the existing zone at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| And given the topography of that property, really there's no opportunity to introduce additional residential zoning at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1205)|
| 0:20:14| Honestly, it would be very difficult to introduce any significant development at all on those two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| They're really just kind of vacant land and would be difficult to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| But the road comes across the very south or northeastern corner of that, and it just shaves the 299 Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| And the reason that was included was because it's such a narrow lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| It really serves no other purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| It also gives you a little wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| If the road, when you're starting to construct it, you have to veer over a couple of feet, and that's all it would take onto that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| then you wouldn't have to come back and rezone that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And so it was the purpose of including that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| I understand any time you're trying to extend commercial zoning is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| Just a few minutes ago on the consent agenda, item number 14 was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| That actually converted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| You can see it there, that hash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| That part right there was industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| It's now been converted to CH2 by that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| So there's a net loss of overall industrial in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| So we're really just trying to accommodate a private drive that's going to increase the flow of traffic through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| serve those existing industrial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| And with that additional road, it's not going to be pulling any more industrial traffic or uses into the established residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1284)|
| 0:21:32| So, you know, not all of that was fully fleshed out at the time of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| I got involved on this on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| So I understand, you know, that this is some new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| But with this information, respectfully, I would ask that you approve the sector plan one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| and the rezoning for industrial just to be able to accommodate this common access driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you, Councillor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Vice Chair Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1333)|
| 0:22:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| So what they're proposing with just having the rear portion of those lots be zoned general industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| it would be less of an encroachment into this residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| It would no longer access those local residential streets of Nash Road and Old State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| It would still compromise, you know, it would still incentivize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Clearly there are plans to remove that vegetative buffer that does provide some protection to the existing residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| So that would still be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| But it's generally less of an encroachment than it was originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1381)|
| 0:23:09| And then I would assume since it's going to be backing up to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| there would be an additional setback, a larger setback off the remaining residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| I mean the setback requirements between industrial and residential properties would remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| Considering the amendment by the applicant and staff comments and that there's no opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the sector plan amendment to LI Light Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| We have a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve the plan amendment, sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1430)|
| 0:24:03| That's for the backpack, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Yeah, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion that we approve the one-year plan amendment to LI Light Industrial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1466)|

| 0:24:39| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Then I'd like to make a motion that we approve the IG General Industrial Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| All right, we have a motion by Vice Chair Uten, seconded by Commissioner Phillips to approve General Industrial Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| We have a light from Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Commissioner Higgins, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| All right, do we need to specify as amended for this, too, for the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| As amended on the one-year plan and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| And the rezoning, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| Okay, so we will denote as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| Should we redo that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| Okay, so it's understood that the one-year plan was as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| and it's understood that this motion on the rezoning is as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| So, seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Moving on to agenda item number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| The applicant is Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Location, north of Tipton Avenue, west of Moody Avenue, south of Baker Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| Approximate size, 2.55 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Present plan and zoning designation, low-density residential, RN5, and historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| Proposed plan designation, civic and institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Existing land use, public, quasi-public land, public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| Staff recommendation on motion one is to deny the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| to civic and institutional classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| because it does not meet any of the criteria for a change to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| The second motion, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| deny the one-year plan amendment to civic and institutional land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| because it does not meet the criteria for a change to the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| Motion three, staff recommendation, deny institutional zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| because it is not consistent with the intent of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I think I have a list of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Would you like to defer, Councilor Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I'll defer, please. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| So signed up, we have Kimberly Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1640)|
| 0:27:29| Is Kimberly Russell here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Rachel Loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Is Rachel Loop here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Ms. Loop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I apologize if I am going off base, but please tell me if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| I've never done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| So my name is Rachel Loop, and I am a resident of Lindbergh Forest since 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1669)|
| 0:27:58| and a parent of a child at Dogwood Elementary since 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| I wanted to start off by saying how pleased we are at how the McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| has approached our community regarding the planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| and purchase of South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| The McNabb Center has been very open and honest with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| and we appreciate the transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| The McNabb Center has served Knoxville in so many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| and I am very grateful for the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| My family and I have several tough conversations about the McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| moving their center point facility into South High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| how this facility will affect our family, our children's commute to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| and our family's walks or bikes around the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| how it will affect our feelings of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| The McNabb Center has been able to answer a lot of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| and has genuinely made me and my family feel at ease with Center Point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| entering our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| I feel confident with the McNabb Center will stay in our community for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| like they have proven in other communities around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| But what happens if they decide that South Knoxville location isn't big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| or no longer meets their current needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| What happens if they decide to turn the residential medical detox facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| into an outpatient facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| What happens if they decide to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and they sell to someone who turns it into an inpatient or outpatient facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| How do we protect our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| So Tuesday night, the Lindbergh Forest neighborhood met with the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| During the meeting, I proposed for the McNabb Center to file the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| This would keep the South High building zoned for RN-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| but allow an exception for the McNabb Center to run as an institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| This would ensure our community that what was going into South High building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| cannot and will not be anything other than what has been proposed and promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| At the neighborhood meeting, Mr. Mullins stated there was a deadline of June 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| for state funding for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| It seemed that the McNabb Center is not interested in this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| It would require additional time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Mr. Mullins suggested a deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| My concern about the deed restriction is there is nothing that prevents the McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| from turning the proposed residential program to an outpatient program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| or any other program that was not discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| I understand that time and money is involved, and people don't have a lot to spare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| but I would rather see the McNabb Center take a little bit more time up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| to ensure a better relationship with the community in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| I strongly feel that the plan development option is the best option for my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| the South Knoxville community, and in the long run, CenterPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you, Ms. Loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Could I get your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| 808 Goldfinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| If you don't mind, if you have signed up, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Any others that have signed up against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Could I just see a show of hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| We've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| So we're going to be, we've got four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Okay, we have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| So, you know, we typically only give five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| We've got two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Commission, would you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I would suggest we give a total of ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Give a total of ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Okay, so we've got seven minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So if we could, how about three minutes each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| Would you be agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| So we've got four folks speaking against left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| If you'll please limit your comments to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Let's go on to John Timmerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1918)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| Hello, my name is John Timmerman, and I reside at 835 Tipton Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| I've been a resident there at South Hive since August of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| I was the fourth one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| I'm also now the youngest one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I'm the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| But the main thing is, this is our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| A lot of our residents voted for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| You know, and it's just hard to take away that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| You know, there's a 106-year-old lady there that's going to have to be told she has to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| You know, we provide for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| We had a trunk or treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We had over 500 bags of candy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Last Saturday we had, what, 700 Easter egg hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| So it's just, you know, we're part of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| We've had residents there from World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| We've had three Vietnam vets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| One of them was an F-4 fighter pilot that got shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| And he was a POW for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| So I just, you know, this is the last place we thought we'd all ever have to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| And now, you know, they're going to have to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| We've had residents from Knox High move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Now they're going to probably have to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| So I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Timmerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Mickey Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Mickey Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2035)|
| 0:34:11| Mickey Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I live at 3109 Ticonderoga Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| My mother is a new resident of South High, so I have a personal interest in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| But as a resident of South Knoxville, I also have a concern for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| This facility is in a neighborhood with Dogwood Elementary School right next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| a children's recreation center in the neighborhood, and South Doyle Middle School just a couple minutes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| A few days after the announcement of this potential sale, a man came into South High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| appeared to be on drugs, and was looking for drugs and mentioned the McNabb Center by name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| stating something like, they help him out when he gets like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| The police were called and the schools were placed on lockdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| but by the time the police got there, the man had left and they could not find him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| This is the kind of thing I fear, people like that just wandering around the community when children are so close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| We already have so much to worry about in keeping our schools and our kids safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| with all the school shootings in our country and recently in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| without adding a drug rehab facility with unstable people that close to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| The facility will be an unlocked facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| which means patients can check themselves out of the program voluntarily at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| and they'll be allowed to have visitors while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| All of this makes me very nervous about the safety in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Mr. Dover received taxpayer grants to renovate this facility for an assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| It should be used for sustainable long-term care for our seniors who are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| Now he's trying to sell the facility and make a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| and the facility will no longer be used for the intended purpose for which he received the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| if this sale is final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| This seems like a huge misappropriation of funds to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| We don't have another assisted living facility in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| so if this sale occurs, not only will the residents have to move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| they will have to move to other parts of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| which will make it harder on their families to visit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Many of these people have dementia, and changing environments will be hard on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| My mother is just really getting adjusted to living there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| and it will further set her back cognitively, emotionally, and probably physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| if she has to adjust to another new environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| This will likely be the case for most of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| It's not fair to cause these residents, many of whom have grown up in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| and contributed to our community, to have to relocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| so that addicts can use this building as a temporary home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| It's fine that Mr. Dover wants to sell his building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| He has every right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| I have personally spoken with somebody who is interested in buying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| and keeping it an assisted living facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| and I think this would be in the best interest for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| I'm a home health physical therapist, and I work in the South Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| My job is to help people stay safe in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Through my work, I know how important it is to people to be safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| and to be able to stay in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| There are people currently living in this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| who have planned on making South High their last home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I'm not opposed to the idea of a drug rehab facility at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and I'm not opposed to having one in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| I am opposed to the location they're trying to put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Let them find a building that doesn't already have people calling it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2245)|

| 0:38:14| Thank you for letting me speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| I'm also not only a resident of South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| but also a parent of a child at Dogwood Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| I'm fully supportive of having a place for people to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| and get help for substance abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| I will add that this is not a partisan issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| We all have varying opinions on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| There's also a lot of speculation about what could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| should a rehab facility be placed at the South High Senior Living location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| None of us has a crystal ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| but I want to share some realities with you, some hard realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| I went to pick up this shirt the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| and my 10-year-old son, who attends Dogwood Elementary, was with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| He said, Mom, what's the shirt for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| So I told him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I believe in being very honest with your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I told him about the potential for a drug rehab facility going next to his school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| He was quiet for some time, which is unusual for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| and after a minute said, Mom, I would be really scared to have that next to my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| Imagine how he would feel each morning at drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| looking out the window and seeing that building and what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| He'll be scared to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Aren't these kids scared enough already with two lockdowns so far this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| The other reality is that dozens of seniors who have made South High their final home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| will be displaced and separated from their friends and caregivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| who they've counted on to help them live their final days comfortably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Many of them will not survive such a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Where will they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| There's a reason why this was to be pushed through without the community's knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| and it was leaked on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| It's about money, not about doing the right thing for our children, seniors, and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| Please do the right thing today and vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| Mr. Michael Wolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Michael Wolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| My name is Michael Wolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I live at 824 Tipton Avenue, directly across the street from the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| What the ladies have said about the seniors that live across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| yes, it's going to be a travesty that you are going to kick them out, make them move elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Yes, I heard about the dealings of the tax credits and all that with the gentleman who owns the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| But besides all that, safety for the children is the number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| And there's also many older, low-income, senior citizens that live around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2449)|
| 0:40:59| If you put a drug rehab across the street from my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| who's to say that when they want something and they can't get it the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| that I won't become a victim or the other older people that live in this neighborhood become victims?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| I understand, yes, you need to treat people who have a drug addiction, but in reality, you also ought to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| they knew what they were doing before they need this treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| If parents did their jobs when they were younger, they know drugs are no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| I know the police are handcuffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| I'm telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| You look around our neighborhood and the existing neighborhoods around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| they out and publicly, literally deal drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| You can watch them hand money for drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| It's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| We do not need a drug rehab in this, in our tiny little neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| We have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| We have older people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| If you do what you're going to do, it's a travesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| I believe that's all that signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2551)|
| 0:42:40| Did I overlook someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| Sir, did you sign up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| No, I just signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| I don't know if you have enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Well, I don't have much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| Do you have anything new to add to the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Well, I'd just like to ask you all, would you like it fixed in your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| I've had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| And if you want to make comments, and it's not a forum to ask us questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| but if you want to make comments and you can contribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| unless commission objects, I'll give you a couple of minutes to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| And if you'd state your name and address, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Baker Trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| We have the properties at 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Sir, could you pull the microphone toward you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| 900, 906, 912, and 918 Baker behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| And since they found out, the residents found out about what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| three people moved out the first of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| They just don't want their kids around it or want anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| And, of course, I don't reside there myself, but if I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| and I would ask you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| would you like it right next door to you with your children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| I think there is a need for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| but I do not think there's a need for it right there in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| in a residential historic overlay area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2660)|
| 0:44:27| And that's about all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| I didn't sign up this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| but I would like to speak if it would be okay with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Are there any others that want to speak so that we can gauge how much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| We'll give you two minutes, ma'am, if you'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| My name is Virginia Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| My address is 904 Virginia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I'm an employee for South High Senior Living as a caregiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| I've always felt strongly gravitated towards our seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| from being knee-high to a grasshopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Since being at South High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| this has been my first employment opportunity to work with seniors in a professional setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| outside of family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I have fallen in love with each and every resident I have come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| I feel as a caregiver it's part of my job to advocate for our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| especially those that couldn't join us here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| for lack of transportation, safety issues, or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| Each resident there is a special, special gift to this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| Everyone has their own story, their own personality, and they are just gems to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| If you all vote yes to rezone this today, you are mining our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| You're mining the community of something rich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| especially for the children that often get to take part in the community activities that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| That lights up the seniors' faces and makes their entire week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| I specifically work in memory care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| And if you do rezone this to Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| you're writing a death sentence for many of my residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| I call them my sweethearts for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| They have stolen my heart time and time again every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| and I would not want to work anywhere else with any of them being displaced from their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Counselor Mullins, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here on behalf of the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| I also have with me Mr. Houston Smelser and Ms. Jennifer Heal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| who can answer any operational questions about Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| and what they intend to do with this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| This is a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| There are actually three requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| There's the sector plan and the one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| where we're asking for the sector plan and one-year to revert back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| from its current LDR to the civic institutional plan amendment that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| in place back in 2017 when Mr. Dover acquired this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| And we're also asking that it be rezoned from its current RN-5 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| institutional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Staff hasn't recommended these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| but we still believe that these plan amendments and zonings are legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| and appropriate in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| And I'll talk about the sector plan and one-year plan amendments first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| Those plans can be changed if it meets one of four specified criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| And here we meet two out of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| One of the conditions is if there's a change of condition warranting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| amendment to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| In 2017, when the sector plan and one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| at the time of this property, it was civic institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| You can look back and refer to the case 2-C-17-SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| That was when Miss Wade with the city asked for it to be changed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| civic institutional to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| And it was changed at that time because South High had been vacant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| blighted since 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| And it was changed specifically to accommodate Mr. Dover's planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| The civic institutional plan designation that was in place at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| was properly in place for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| All of the property there, do you see the civic institutional zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| In 2017, the sector plan for South High and the school property was all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| civic institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| It was in there because it was owned by the county at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| Since that time, it's been represented this is the only assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| facility in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| And that may be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| But as I understand, only 20% of the residents come from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| This is why Mr. Dover reached out to Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| It's just not a sustainable business model at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| Countywide average occupancy for assisted living facilities are over 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Currently, the occupancy rate at South High is just 29 residents out of 65 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| There may be a need for it, but there hasn't been a demonstrated need at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| location, and that's why this represents a significant change in conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| since the plan amendment was changed in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| There's also trends in development and population that warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| reconsideration of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| The reversion back to civic institutional would accommodate a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| treatment facility this county desperately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| There isn't a bigger need in this community than getting people off drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| You don't have to take my word for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| You can look back at the statistics that the district attorney here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| County keeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Since 2017, when this sector plan was changed, there was 300 overdose deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| in 2017 alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| That was a representation, 33% increase from the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| In 2018, that number was 325 deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| In 2019, it was 293, but then in 2020, it increased to 413 deaths from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| overdoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| That's 41% up from 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| In 2021, the last statistics that the district attorney has kept, it was 533| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| deaths in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| That's 29% up from 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| What the McNabb Center is trying to do with the residential treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| facility is make sure that these people who are in the community right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| they are our colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| They're our friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| They're our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| They're professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| They have this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| We're trying to make sure they can get help for this problem so they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| live to be the age of these seniors that are in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| This location is tailor-made to allow almost a turnkey conversion from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| assisted living to residential treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| It'll allow the McNabb Center to quickly and efficiently double its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| service capacity from 1,500 a year to an additional 3,000 clients every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| year from its current location at Centerpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| This trend showing that these overdose deaths are going up, up, up, and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| and even some of the comments we heard from opposition about what they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| in the community, that alone is to justify, to demonstrate a need for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| And trends in population changes and population and development and need is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| one of the reasons why you can amend the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| Staff also recommends denying the zoning on this based upon their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| interpretation of 8.2A of the city zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| And essentially, staff's interpretation of that ordinance is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| It can only be used as an expansion of an existing institutional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| It must be related to uses already established on a campus of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| And I just don't think that that is the accurate reading of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| If that were the case, you could never establish an institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| It could only be used if it were an expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| That's not consistent with the plain reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| It allows for both governmental and private institutional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| It can only take place if there's five contiguous acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| but it doesn't say those acres have to be related to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| If it's warranted to limit the uses to an expansion of existing campuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| already established, then it would be nearly impossible to ever establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| a new institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| But if that's what the zoning ordinance wanted to limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| then it could very easily have stated that no expansion of the institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| zone shall be allowed unless it's expansion of an established adjacent use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| or campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| And that's just simply not found in the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| The expansion restriction is tied to ensuring that institutional uses such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| as healthcare is done in a manner that protects surrounding communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| and that's what we're here to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| But it's hard to argue that institutional zoning isn't appropriate on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| parcel because this parcel once had the institutional one-year plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| It didn't have the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| None of the property had that zoning until RECODE when it was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| And I can illustrate this scenario through this hypothetical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| Let's assume that Mr. Dover didn't try to acquire this property in 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| and it continued to sit vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| No one bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| It was still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| When RECODE came along, it would have been county property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| and it would have been rezoned to institutional like the remaining county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| property in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| At that time, it could have been then sold by the county to McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| which would have allowed accommodation of this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| Now, if that scenario could have existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| and it could have under the current zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| then how can you say that the zone cannot be extended now to allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| that use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Those two concepts are just they cannot be at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| but that's exactly what the interpretation appears to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| Now, I agree the ordinance could be worded better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| But in the legal realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| when you're dealing with the interpretation of zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| the overarching legal principle is if there's an ambiguity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| that ambiguity is supposed to be read in favor of the property owner and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| free use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| And so if there are essentially balls and strikes get called in favor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3285)|

| 0:54:55| Now, during the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| Commissioner Huber asked a question about whether office zoning was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| And I thought that was an appropriate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| Prior to filing for any rezoning, I, along with Mr. Smeltzer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| went and met with Director Welch, Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and Ms. Hillman to discuss the options before we filed for any zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| We wanted to see what our options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| And there's only three zones that work on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| There's highway commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| which I think we all agree isn't appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| There's office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| And then there's the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| And we looked at what office zoning is already established in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| And there isn't any office zoning for over 4,000 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| You have to get to Chapman Highway before you find any sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| one-year plan, or office zoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| So the conversation was if this is the use that we need to establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| then our best chance would be to ask for the institutional zone as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| extension of the existing institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| Now, they didn't tell us they would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| But we felt like that was the best opportunity to establish that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| to go back to the zone that's allowed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| And there's a question, how can we do this next to an elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| And there's no prohibition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| I understand the concerns that parents have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| People get very nervous with a use like this, and understandably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| But the zone allows in the institutional zone for both schools and both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| residential treatment centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| The zone has listed the uses that they feel are compatible within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| existing institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| What isn't allowed and what we do not do is all of our residents are screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| They're there voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| They're not committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| They're not there against their will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| They come in because they want help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| And we screen them, and there's no sex offenders there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| There is a prohibition for sex offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| There is a prohibition for sex offenders within an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| and we do screen for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| So that will not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| Staffs pointed out that other potential uses that may be too intensive for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| this property, and we are willing to file deed restrictions limiting certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| uses in this facility in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| That is something that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| It's something that McNabb routinely does because we hear these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| concerns often, and so that's something that we can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| When CenterPoint was established almost 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| it was basically in a large field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| It has now been grown up into a residential community around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| You can go to the zoning map at Ball Camp Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| and you can look at what it looked like in 1998 with the facility versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| what it looks like now with a community that's grown up around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| a thriving community that we've existed and been good neighbors with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| entire time, and we don't have a history of police calls for our residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| leaving and causing trouble in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| That just hasn't been our experience at that location at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| I understand this is an emotional decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| but it's not about assisted living versus residential treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| There's a need for both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| There is a need for both of them in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| and we're trying to serve that need based upon Mr. Dover's needing to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| So that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| We're here for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| It's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| The zoning will allow it, and I would respectfully ask that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| approve this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| I want to say thank you to all the community members that have spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| and to hearing from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| I think what sits on my mind the most with this case is some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| history and where it sits right now, and really thinking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| not in the paradigm of is it a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| There's been a lot of discussion about McNabb that's very public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| but we are tasked with thinking about all the uses that may be there if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| do rezone this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| And there's a temptation to think about the history there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| which puts my frame of mind back to this is really a decision about land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| And the history of this, the recent history of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| is that the city and the community have put in a great deal of time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| treasure to get this property back online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| It's a historic property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| And if you haven't been there, it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| And it is an asset to that residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| One of the applicants talked or one of the opposition said something about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| the exchange between Old South High and Dogwood Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| the students there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| So there's an alignment in terms of the current usage that I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| important for us to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| Because in terms of land use, that is part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| It's being used by the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| You can use it and go tour it if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| If we change this to institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| we may very well lose that in terms of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| So the investment that the city and the community made in saying through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| the whole RFP process and through trying to get community input for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| they wanted in this spot kind of goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| Because some of those institutional uses are essentially private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| While they may be under a nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| they are private uses that people have privacy for those rehab treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3662)|
| 1:01:11| So when you think about the land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| that really takes it away from that community again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| which is what really sits uncomfortably with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| The RN-5 zone has the ability for it to be many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| just as the institutional does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| but it has many opportunities that require special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| and then others by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| But it seems to be, in terms of the situation of the community there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| it's embedded in the middle of a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| physically, literally connected to Sarah Simpson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and then surrounded by Dogwood Elementary and Cecil Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| I think that the RN-5 is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| And I make a motion to accept staff's recommendation to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| We have a motion to deny sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| I see other lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3738)|
| 1:02:30| So chair will entertain a second if there's not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3750)|
| 1:02:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| So we have a motion by Commissioner Adams, seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3761)|
| 1:02:48| We have some other lights here for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| and we'll move on to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| So, Mr. Mullins, I'm going to ask you some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| and we may have to refer to Mr. Smelter there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| One of the things that came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| and I heard it shouted when you mentioned that the McNabb Center will screen people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| and that sex offenders cannot be served because of the proximity to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| That exists because the school takes precedence under state law, correct, for the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| What happens to the McNabb Center if they're found in violation of serving someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| on the sex offender registry in that zone close to the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| I'll need to defer that to Mr. Smelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3811)|

| 1:03:40| Commissioner Smith, our understanding is that, well, there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| First off, within 1,000 feet of the property line of a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| if you are a sex offender, you are by law not permitted to be in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| I think there are exemptions that the schools themselves can allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| If you have a parent of a child where the parent is a sex offender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| they can come on campus with negotiation with the school when and how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| But sex offenders are not allowed to be, by law, within 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| The McNabb Center does not operate any services for sex offenders anywhere in its continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| In fact, we are the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| The McNabb Center is the sexual assault center of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| We are the therapeutic preschool that serves children that are victims of neglect and abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| We are the other side on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| On that, talk to us for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| You know, there's the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Clinic over on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Kind of help us understand the difference between this facility and that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| serving people who were just going through the cycle of reentry into the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| So those are two adjoining properties with two separate facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| The program you're talking about, Commissioner Smith, is the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| which is an immediate alternative to citizens who have been picked up by law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| who have a set number of charges that have been predetermined by the DA's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| the sheriff's office, the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| So those are folks who are coming as an alternative to prison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| but it is something that's being allowed by the legal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| The adjoining property that's been referred to, the Centerpoint Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| is a voluntary, residential, medically monitored detox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| long-term residential substance abuse treatment facility that has been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| since the McNabb Center merged with DRY, Detoxification Rehabilitation Institute, back in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3933)|
| 1:05:40| It's been in that location for almost 27 years, providing this type of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| and that type of service only on a voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| And the reason why I wanted to make sure there was a distinction there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| because if I'm understanding your all's service correctly, what you're proposing in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| they're not criminals, they're not violent criminals, they're not sex offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| they're not there involuntarily, meaning court ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| These are our neighbors, our friends, in some cases our family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| that are just needing some assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| We can do this cordially or you all can shout, but that's not going to help your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| So I would just recommend not yelling out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| We can ask you questions, but I just would recommend you not yelling out at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| Help me, where the Centerpoint Facility is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| help me understand what has been the crime history around that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| since that opened in 1997, 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| Sure. So we've actually, Commissioner Smith, I want to answer both of your two questions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| We've actually pulled 911 data three times in fairly recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| We expanded the Centerpoint Facility back in the early 2000s to allow for some additional beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| That wing eventually became our wing dedicated for providing these services for women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| We did it again when we were launching the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| I referred to back in 2018, and then we've done it again more recently as part of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| The 911 calls that are happening at our facility largely are us seeing things happening around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| in the community where we need to call law enforcement and say, hey, we've seen something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| It's our duty as an organization to say we see something happen in our community and we're reporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| Has there never been a 911 call that we've called for one of our residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| We have people that have physical health issues where we need an ambulance to come on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| and to work with those people, perhaps transport them to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| Have we had someone who was needing a 911 to come and to work with them around some issues they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4065)|
| 1:07:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| We've had that happen in the past 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Is it frequent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| No, it's exceptionally rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| You also asked the question about whether or not any of the residents of Centerpoint have any, are they criminals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| Absolutely, there have been criminal charges for many of the residents who have come to Centerpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| but please remember these are people who are voluntarily taking a step to come to a long-term residential facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| to get treatment for those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| These are not people who are being chained into this facility against their will for their treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| It's all voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| One last question, and I know you held up a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| I want you to talk more, and you may not have this data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| and then I've got one more statement to make before I yield the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Thinking about what has happened around that community over the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| have property values increased or decreased based on data that you all have looked at in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| I think Ben alluded to the fact that around Centerpoint there's just been a massive concentration of residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4135)|
| 1:09:01| after we moved in, so I would assume that residential neighborhoods have more value than an open field in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4141)|
| 1:09:08| So the McNabb Center, and this is good context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| we have close to 80 facilities in 15 different East Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| All those facilities are serving people or associated with mental health, substance abuse, social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4156)|
| 1:09:25| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| So all of our facilities live in kind of the same vein in terms of their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| We are an excellent fiscal organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| We've been around for 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| If you visited any of our facilities, you would find them to be very well-kept, beautiful facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| and there's not a single one of them that we wouldn't be proud of to show you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| So I would say it's just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| We bring nothing but value to our associated neighbors for all the developments we've conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| And then one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Someone from opposition asked the question, would you want your family to live next to the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| I'm just going to say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| My senior citizen mother lives directly behind the center right over off of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| Would I feel comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| She lives there, and I have no fear for her safety living alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| My dad passed away in 2020 due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| So I'm just going to answer your question directly so you hear it directly from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| Yes, I would have no problem with a facility like this because I know she's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| I know that community is safe, and the crime data shares that with where she lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4227)|
| 1:10:37| Mr. Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| I've got a couple of questions, and I want to make a statement too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| We've heard a lot about what the possible uses are of this facility if it gets rezoned, what things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4249)|
| 1:11:01| I might ask what happens if it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| We've heard people talk about the fact that it's not viable as an assisted living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| It's not going to continue to be that, and I think is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| One way or the other, it's possible that it may not survive in its current state as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| So what happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I mean, you go back to a vacant building that gets dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| I don't discount the concern with the other uses that are possible if it gets rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4290)|
| 1:11:38| What I would ask of staff, and maybe our attorney as well or Mr. Welch, is there a means or method?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4298)|
| 1:11:47| Because it seems like they're worried about what happens down the road with the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Is there a means or method that we have available to us as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| or a special program that would allow this use of this property without rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4316)|
| 1:12:10| I think our staff is trying to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| Is there anything that we could put in there to restrict the use within the institutional zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| So we can't do conditional zoning within the city jurisdiction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| I'm not asking about conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| I'm talking about a special use, some kind of a special use that would allow them to operate as this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| without rezoning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| So if the McNabb Center failed or moved out or it didn't work, it would still be zoned the way it's zoned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4359)|
| 1:12:47| So RN-5 does not, which is its current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| it does not permit a residential drug and alcohol treatment facility by rider through special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4371)|
| 1:13:04| So there is no way we could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| There is the planned development route, and that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| I can let the applicants speak to the viability of that at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| The planned development route, does that pretty much do what I'm speaking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4397)|
| 1:13:25| The planned development route allows for some flexibility in considering use and form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| in light of community benefits and other amenities that it would provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| I can pull up that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Think of it as an overlay, that it would be specific to that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| and that if it ever left, that use was ever removed, then it would go back to the base or underlying zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| And that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Is there a way that we can get to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| Which, to me, it's a win-win situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| because the applicant is able to operate as they'd like to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| and the community pretty much has a comfort level that it's not going to turn into a halfway house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| or some other thing that's allowed under the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Do you want me to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Commissioner Roth, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| And we talked about planned development with the McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| and there's a couple of things why we did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| It is a very involved process, and I understand that may be a good thing to some respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| but with regard to the financing we have lined up through the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| there wasn't time when we filed this application to go through the planned development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| to get to where we needed to be before those funds are no longer available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| that would allow us to do what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| So we didn't have the runway to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| And the other issue is with the planned development process, it's a fairly new process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| there's no assurances that if we go through this process, which comes to the planning commission first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| then goes to city council, then comes back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| that we would meet the definitions and the requirements to be able to meet that community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| Because of the emotion wrapped up in this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| because of the use that is established and people who do not want to see this use leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| they would still be opposition to that, and there's no guarantee that that would get us to where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| So that's why we are willing to look at the more intensive uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| and indeed restrict them as opposed to going through that planned development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| A question for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| You mentioned the census at the current South High Senior Living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Can you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Sorry, I had trouble hearing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| What the current census is at the Senior Living Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| As I understood, and I spoke to Mr. Dover yesterday, there are currently 29 residents at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4567)|
| 1:16:16| People moved out because they were being sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| Ladies and gentlemen, the applicant and his attorney have been quiet and allowed you all to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4579)|
| 1:16:27| Everyone that signed up had an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| This is not some, you know, we have rules here and we need to abide by the rules, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| The information I was given by Mr. Dover is right now there are 29 residents out of 65 potential residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| Only about 20% of the residents in the history of this facility have come from South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| So, I mean, it's somewhere between 40% and 50% occupancy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Which is really not very sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| We're countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| We're looking at 90% usually for these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Mr. Schmelzer, what is the average stay of a resident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| Commissioner Phillips at our Centerpoint residential facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| We have two different programs I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| We have medically monitored detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| And if we want to go down the rabbit hole there, Jennifer is the much better person to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| But that can be anywhere from a short three-day stay up to as long as ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| Depends on the physical health of the resident, the type of substance that they're detoxing off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| And so those folks will then have the opportunity to transition to long-term residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| which is what we think of more as the 28 to 30-day stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| So the one in South Knoxville would be short-term or long-term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| We would have both of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Typically people that do medically monitored detox then transition to long-term residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| But not everybody who comes into the facility does the detoxification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Some folks go straight into the long-term residential process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| I'd like to call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| We've got some more to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Let's see if this thing has support for the motion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4686)|
| 1:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| So we've taken the lights off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| So we have a motion and a second for denial based on staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4699)|
| 1:18:27| So all in favor of denial say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| So the nays have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| And we'll continue our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Or entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Could you take a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Actually, would you just raise your hands on the ones that were for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| For denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| So it was 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Are we missing one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| 11 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| 11 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| The motion fails 11 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Chair, we'll either entertain additional discussion or we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion, please, and a comment prior to voting on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| Based on the census of South High, less than 50% I agree is not sustainable long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4759)|
| 1:19:29| The numbers are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| I thought we'd already discussed this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| We have moved on to commission discussion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| The public comment, we're beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| So we're commission discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| I think Mr. Mullen's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| I think Mr. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| They give false information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Ma'am, if you'd please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| Ask kindly if you folks would maintain order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| We're at commission discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| We have rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| We'd never have order if we just let people talk willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4809)|
| 1:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| As Mr. Mullen's mentioned, one of the standards for a sector plan amendment is a change in the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| And we are dealing with a national, state, county, city epidemic with drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4831)|
| 1:20:40| And it's not something that any of us want to contend with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| We're happy that McNabb Center is here to handle these kind of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| And it's normally not required for us to look at specific uses that go on a piece of property when we look at rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| But given the situation we have in this country, I think it behooves us as planning commissioners to use some common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4858)|
| 1:21:08| And, you know, Jessie, you did a remarkable job on your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| Unfortunately, I can't accept the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| So I'm going to make a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| and institutional land use classification based on the changing conditions of our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| and the long-term need of the community to help these individuals who ultimately can be viable citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4888)|
| 1:21:37| and responsible to our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Phillips to approve the, what are we doing, changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4905)|
| 1:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| Changing the sector plan to institutional, civic institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| And we have a second by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| And we have some lights on for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| I want to address, first of all, I'm disappointed that my motion didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4932)|
| 1:22:20| I'm also disappointed that there seems to be conflation in the McNab applicant and what we're really looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4940)|
| 1:22:32| I don't think anyone has contested that the nation at large has an issue with so many people dealing with addiction issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4952)|
| 1:22:42| We also, specifically in our community, have an issue with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| We've talked about that here many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| In RN-5, this could be other types of housing, and that could be for seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| That could be for people of other ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| So I think it is incorrect to say that the reason to do this is because of a changing population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4981)|
| 1:23:11| This is not the only use, and McNab may or may not be the only people who might be operating something that is in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| So I think that is a disappointing thing that we're looking at it just through the lens of the potential applicant right now when it is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=4999)|
| 1:23:30| And one other item, in terms of the number of residents there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| I think that it probably does represent a specter of people being concerned about what the future of that facility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5016)|
| 1:23:45| So I can't speak to its accuracy, but that does worry me that it may not be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| And it is also not our job to assess someone's business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| This one effort during a pandemic of this particular facility may not have been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| Perhaps the people who were designing that business model didn't do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| That doesn't mean that that facility is no longer something that the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| who went through an extensive RFP process and community input process, should no longer have any type of access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| And if we zone this institutional, that is what we can be headed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| I appreciate everyone's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| The representative from the McNab Center had mentioned that you do restrict uses at your facility and that you have done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5082)|
| 1:24:52| Under the institutional zone, two of the permitted rights is a halfway house, and there's also a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5092)|
| 1:25:01| I don't know, I guess I'd like to get some comments from Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| If you were to restrict the rights of the uses at this facility, what would you include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5104)|
| 1:25:18| I can't speak to potential restrictions in the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| That would have to be like a private agreement by the applicant on what they would restrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| I can say some of the more intensive uses that are permitted by right include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5127)|
| 1:25:41| And when I say intense, it just means intense operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| It could require a lot of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Healthcare facility, which is like a hospital, halfway house, homeless shelter, social service center, large animal care facility, drug treatment clinic, drug and alcohol facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5146)|
| 1:25:56| residential, which we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| So when in the process would those restrictions be placed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| We can get the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Obviously, we can't restrict the property until we own them because they'd be deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| So it would be when we acquired the property, they would go down with the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| But we can have those restrictions fleshed out as this goes through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| And a homeless shelter and halfway house are two of the uses that we looked at that we would be willing to restrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| Incidentally, the halfway house is allowed in R and 5 as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| I mean, there is a special use process, but it is an allowed use that we would be willing to restrict on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| You know, I guess I would like to just comment that I feel like this is a very marginalized group of people that are in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| I listened to the mom, and she said something about her son being afraid of maybe going to school next to a drug rehabilitation facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5208)|
| 1:26:58| And, you know, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| But I'm hoping that maybe that boy will learn that, you know, these are people just like me, and, you know, they need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5221)|
| 1:27:09| And maybe he's going to grow up not too afraid, you know, having gone to school and realize that, you know, people are in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5229)|
| 1:27:19| just like people in my family or people in your family or in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| Thank you, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| How about Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| The sector plan of civic institution, I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| It's, if not for a changing of population or condition, also just a minor extension of the existing civic institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5267)|
| 1:27:55| So I think it's got another justification for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| Whether the property could be residential for anyone, you know, that's up to the owner what they want to do with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| And the owners come to an agreement with Helen Ross McNabb to come before us to request this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| And I think that this is a good thing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| The stigmatization of addicts being labeled that way is inherently dangerous, I think is not good rhetoric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| And as Amy said, a good opportunity to teach people that people have struggles in life and a lot of people need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5304)|
| 1:28:34| So I support the sector plan amendment and the other rezonings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| And, you know, city council is going to have to take this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| So, you know, talk to your elected representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| Thank you, Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| I agree with a lot of the comments that we do have a need for rehab facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| And nationally, locally, there's a very strong need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| I think in this scenario, not looking at just this specific use, I do think that staff has interpreted this correctly based off the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5342)|
| 1:29:15| section 8.2 talks about government uses being zone institutional and medical uses as an extension of a campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5355)|
| 1:29:23| And so I do think that that criteria does not allow for or permit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| And then there's also mention of the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| And, you know, in that scenario, it does allow for divided up lots to be less than five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| But in this scenario, these are very different institutional uses and zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| But I think if this were multifamily, which it's already zoned for, but if this were an attempt to go towards that, I think it would be very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| But, and, you know, we try not to talk about use when it comes to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| We've had a lot of conversations about use today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| And I do think if you're looking at use, I think that a senior living facility next to a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5404)|
| 1:30:13| in this area makes a lot of sense in terms of the interactions with kids and the access to the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5413)|
| 1:30:24| And I also, I wouldn't, I don't want to base decisions off of, this decision off of what we've been told about potential occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5424)|
| 1:30:35| I know that there's times where someone, you know, will plan on a change with their property and then begin to behave with the management differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5435)|
| 1:30:49| I don't know, I'm not speculating that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| I'm just saying I wouldn't want to base decisions off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| And I do think that if this were to be an appropriate use, based off the way the zoning code is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5454)|
| 1:31:03| and pretty much everything else in staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| I do think that the proper way to go about this would be a planned development and not an outright rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5468)|
| 1:31:16| So for that reason, you know, maybe this is a decent use, but I don't think that this is the best way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5476)|
| 1:31:23| I think it would need to go through planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| So for that reason, I do not support any of these motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| And I also will say that after, I need to step out for a minute for another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5492)|
| 1:31:40| And so if I leave, based off this motion, that is not me storming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| I believe it was Mr. Mullins that said that in 2020 there was 413 overdose deaths in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| And my older brother was one of those 413.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| And had he had more access to somewhere like the McNabb Centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| I don't know that we would be in the position that we are as a family now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| Someone asked earlier would I mind having that in my backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| and I absolutely would not mind having that in my backyard because my family would probably still be intact at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| It has nothing to do with if it's a senior facility or if it's a drug rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| The building itself is going to change regardless because it's not at full capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| And, you know, McNabb offers several school policies, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| to where they come in and teach kids about not using drugs and how to support their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| And with it being right next to a school, I have four children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| so I understand where the moms and the dads, like I understand your emotional state with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| But McNabb can offer so many more things to these kids than any of us probably realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| So I just wanted to give McNabb my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5587)|
| 1:33:14| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| Okay, so we have a motion and a second on the floor for a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| to approve plan amendment for civic and institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| We have, how many no's do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| One, two, three no's, three no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| Motion passes 11-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| All right, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| I'd like to make a motion, please, to approve a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| as a minor extension to the adjacent civic and institutional land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| All right, we have a motion to approve a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| and seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| Seeing no light, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| We have three no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| Motion passes 11-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| Before I make a motion on the rezoning, I would ask Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| you'd mentioned earlier that you would put restrictions on the property for certain uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| Would it be possible to talk to the current owner about putting those on now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| prior to transferring the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| And again, let me say that this board has no authority over deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| This is a, can you all make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| and try to make the residents feel a little more comfortable with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| I understand, and we would be willing to have those conversations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| I'm going to make a motion to approve the institutional rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| as it is a minor extension of the adjacent institutional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| All right, so we've got a motion to approve the institutionals from R and 5 to institutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5727)|
| 1:35:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Okay, and did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| And a second from Commissioner Barger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Did I overlook Commissioner Meyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| No, it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| All right, so we've got, I'm going to give credit to this one for Commissioner Barger as the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| Maybe a tie with Commissioner Meyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| We have two no's, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Two no's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Okay, so motion passes 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5763)|
| 1:36:13| Thank you for those that were a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| These are tough, tough issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| We're experiencing a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| I respect every vote on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| This is not about heroes and villains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| If we didn't vote your way, we're not out to be villains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| And if we voted your way, I don't think we're taking credit to be heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| These are extreme times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| Sometimes extreme times call for extreme measures, and we may not always have the best method of getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| So I respect everyone's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| However you did vote, I hope the community will understand, and I understand the concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| We are, unfortunately, in an epidemic where the number one cause of death in the ages 18 to 45 is fentanyl poisoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5818)|
| 1:37:08| and it continues to rise, and I don't have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| If I did, I promised you I'd share them with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| I think almost every family has been touched by this epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| Many live in shame because of it, because of comments like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| if you raised your kids right, they'd know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| Maybe I didn't raise my kid right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| I had one that suffered addiction through a very traumatic experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| I feel led to share that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| That doesn't mean that our decision is right and wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| but we all bring our backgrounds and experiences to weigh in on these difficult decisions for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| And so I just appreciate everyone's patience and hope we get unity and understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Well put, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| And if I could ask we'd take a five minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| We'll take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Everyone will please take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| We will attempt to reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| And we will now move to agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| The applicant is Taylor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| Location, east side of Dresser Road, north of Ginn Drive, south of Mount Vernon Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5902)|
| 1:38:29| Approximate size tract, 3.176 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| Present plan and zoning designation, low density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| RN1, single family residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| Current plan designation, MUSD SCO-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| and the existing land use is agricultural forestry vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| Staff recommendation on the first motion, and this will require three motions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| is to approve the sector plan amendment to MUSD SCO-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5939)|
| 1:39:07| the Alcoa Highway small area plan land use classification for the portion of the lot requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| because it is a minor extension of that land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Motion two is to approve the one year plan amendment to MUSD and SCO-3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5960)|
| 1:39:31| land use classification for the portion of the lot requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| because it is a minor extension of that land use class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And motion number three, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| is to approve CG1 zoning for the portion of the lot requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| because it is a minor extension of the zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| and is not anticipated to create any adverse impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| All right, we do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| All right, would you like to proceed or defer, Councilor Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6017)|
| 1:40:25| Here on behalf of the developer of this track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| as Chairman Hills pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| it's just for a portion of this property that currently has this LDR sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6032)|
| 1:40:41| So we're in one of these situations where we have a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| that has a split or bifurcated sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| where we have for part of the property the mixed-use specialty district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| for the sector plan one-year plan and then the other has the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| And so what we're asking is for just this portion to align with the other part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6060)|
| 1:41:08| that already has that sector plan designation of mixed-use specialty district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| We would leave and request that the back kind of finger annex part remain LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| That provides a buffer for the residential houses and lots that are back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| That's also got some hillside issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| Adjacent to this parcel, I guess to the north, address 2920 Dresser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6093)|
| 1:41:42| my client has legal interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| That property is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| and so we've already started the voluntary annexation process to bring that into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| That property has a sector plan designation of mixed-use specialty district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| and has a zoning designation of the general commercial CA for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| So like I said, we've started that process that should be hopefully concluded sometime this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| to bring that in, and then we'll create one kind of cohesive lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| And the ultimate plan here is for a multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| This area has suffered from lack of development, kind of blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| and that's happened for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| And then we've had the redevelopment of Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| It's been about a ten-year process, and with that concluding, this area is ripe for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| We think this is a good project that will kick-start the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| I've been in conversations on multiple occasions with Councilman Tommy Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| This is his district that he's over, and he is 100% behind it, thinks it's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6166)|
| 1:42:53| thinks it's going to be great to get this area kind of going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| He put me in contact with a kind of area leader, Mr. Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| I don't know if you all are familiar with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| I know he's been here a good bit, probably speaking on behalf of his involvement in the Alcoa corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| He's lived in the area for over 50 years and had a great conversation, lengthy conversation with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| He's 100% behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| He said I could let the Planning Commission know that he endorses this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| and is very supportive of this request and the ultimate development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| He thinks it's a great use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| He's actually been in discussions with our architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| I see he's an architect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| As noted in the staff report, the request does satisfy the requirements for the requested sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6220)|
| 1:43:50| It does satisfy the requirements for the one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| as well as the list of requirements under the ordinance for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| There was a question as to why we were requesting the commercial, the CG1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| instead of some type of residential zoning that allows a higher density for multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| The simple answer to that is everything around us, at least to the north and to the west there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6253)|
| 1:44:22| our commercial, even all the way across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| we don't see any real support or grounds that would allow for a legal rezoning to a RN5, RN6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| as there's simply not any in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| The CG1 does allow for the multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| With that being consistent with the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| that was the preferred zoning designation to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6283)|
| 1:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| I think we had someone signed up in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| Number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6304)|
| 1:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| I signed up when I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| If you'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| I would like to speak in opposition of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Could you state your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| My name is Paul McQuaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| I live at 3107 Ginn Drive or Ginn, however you say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| My property is catty-corner to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| It's behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| And what it is is there's plenty of commercial property already rezoned right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| They don't need this extra commercial into low-density residential to do their apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6343)|
| 1:45:51| What I heard was apartments, you've got G1 right there that you can build apartments on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| And so this is not zoned for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| It's not zoned for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| It's vacant land that's zoned low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| And it's mission creep is what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| And the RN1 that's just above this is also part of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6372)|
| 1:46:18| And I can see a next meeting where, see, it's already adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| We're just extending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| I take issue with the word a minimal change in this or a minor change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6384)|
| 1:46:33| It's not minor if you put commercial behind low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| I don't call that a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| And you can say you're just straightening up your property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| but you've got plenty of commercial land that you can build your apartments on if that's what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| And if you want to build some transition zone, might be some duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| or some other thing other than commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| But putting commercial into low-density residential is not appropriate for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| We know there's going to be development on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| And there's plenty of areas to be developed on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| You don't need to go into low-density residential and make it commercial in order to build apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6436)|
| 1:47:25| I hope that you all respect the integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| and try to respect the other people who were there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| They have land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| They bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| They knew what it zoned when they bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| They've got commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| You don't need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Do we have any other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6471)|
| 1:48:09| Linda Billman, 3100 Germantown Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| Thanks for letting me speak on behalf of the Martha Washington Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| I think Paul makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| Our neighborhood discovered just a couple days ago that this was being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6503)|
| 1:48:29| We're not necessarily opposed to the idea of a development in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6509)|
| 1:48:39| We would ask that you all consider and remember the Alcoa Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| which had expressed goals for vehicular safety and pedestrian safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| and to provide sidewalks along Dresser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| which would then provide a connection to the Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| which is currently being built on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| We would also like for you to urge the developer to consider our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6544)|
| 1:49:12| which is directly connected to the piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| You'll see those two cul-de-sacs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| And they would be affected to the east there of the commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| So there's a lot of concern from the neighbors that there would be some encroachment by commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6571)|
| 1:49:45| But generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| we urge the commission respectfully to consider the Alcoa Corridor Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| in the development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| And I know you're not developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| but please urge the developer to keep in mind the guidelines of the Alcoa Highway Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Commissioner Schell, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| Yeah, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Would staff mind commenting on the buffering requirements with CG adjacent to RN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6613)|
| 1:50:25| The City Zoning Ordinance has landscaping requirements for buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| I believe it's a Type B landscaping buffer that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| but I will double-check that really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| One buffer or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| So with that, I think that this is an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| I think that the fact that they're not requesting the reason for the entire part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| kind of shows that the project obviously isn't going to encroach too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| And with that buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| so I'd like to make a motion to approve the Sector Plan Amendment per the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| We have a motion by Commissioner Schell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| so seconded by Commissioner Huber to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| Cutting me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| I'll make the motion to approve the One-Year Plan Amendment per the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Schell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| so seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| And motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Motion to approve CG1 per the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| Motion to approve CG1 per the staff recommendation for the portion of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| We have a motion to approve CG1 per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| That was by Commissioner Schell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| so seconded by Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6717)|
| 1:52:06| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Moving along to agenda item number 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Applicant Merchant Holdings, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| location south side of Merchant Drive between Clinton Highway and Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| Approximate size of tract, 11.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| Present plan and zoning designation, LDR, CN, and AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| Proposed plan designation, MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| The motion one of the staff recommendation is approve the sector plan to MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6756)|
| 1:52:44| which is the medium density office land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| because it meets the location criteria for this classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| and is consistent with surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| Bear with me just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Motion two, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| is to approve the one year plan amendment to MDRO for the same reasons as the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6784)|
| 1:53:11| And motion three, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| is to approve RN6 multi-family residential neighborhood zoning for the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| because it is compatible with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Seeing none, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| This may look familiar to some of you that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| In 2021, there was a similar development that was proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| and this commission actually approved the MDRO sector plan for a larger portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| than what we're asking for the zoning here and an approved RN5 zoning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| That was ultimately withdrawn before city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| and that developer didn't move forward with that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| I'm here representing a different developer now that's actually in partnership with KCDC to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6841)|
| 1:54:09| And we have support, generally support, from the community moving forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| and the commission, Councilman Thomas, in the district for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| as this is a plan to develop this for workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| We have public funds that are earmarked for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| There's a pilot on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| And what they originally intended to do was just keep the development within the confines of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| neighborhood commercial zone, which does allow the multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| There's this neighborhood commercial zone that's been on the property for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| It's not consistent with the sector plan there, but it's been there probably before the sector plans were even in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6885)|
| 1:54:53| And they have designed a development for 184 workforce apartments on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| but it's a little constrained within that CN zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| There's some topography issues, some karst topography sinkhole issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| And so they looked at pushing it back about 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| But in the city, there's no mechanism just to adjust the zoning line like there is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6912)|
| 1:55:20| So we started looking at what rezoning options we may have to allow us to spread out the development that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6920)|
| 1:55:26| planned for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| And the options really were to extend the neighborhood commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| and I think that was not the right option because this neighborhood commercial zone just really doesn't fit there very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| or look at another residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| And so we ultimately asked for the RN-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| The reason is the buildings that we have developed, the neighborhood commercial zone allows for 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| RN-5 allows for 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| We can do it, but it would be those flat roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| And we had wanted to do pitched roofs with shingles because that's more in line aesthetically with the character of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| It's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| It's more aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| It's something that the community said they would prefer to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| So we had to ask for the RN-6 to allow the increase of height to allow us really just to design the buildings that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6971)|
| 1:56:20| The remainder of the property you'll see will remain ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| and actually we have a letter of intent with Legacy Parks for that to become a park that will be open for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6983)|
| 1:56:33| So, I mean, that's really what the ask is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| It's 184.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| It's going to allow us to do 184 units, which we can do within the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| It's just a little tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| So we wanted to expand it out, give us more room, maybe push it back further from the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7003)|
| 1:56:49| keep some of that buffer there available, but keep it out of the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| I mean, this is an excellent location for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| It's on a minor arterial street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| It's got access to public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| There's a turn lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| We've got adequate water and sewer, and it's, you know, a lot more appropriate development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7025)|
| 1:57:14| even though we're going to RN-6 than what was proposed in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| which would have taken up a lot more of that property and been a lot more intensive overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| So we have staff support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7042)|
| 1:57:24| We'd ask that you follow staff support and vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| Vice Chair Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the sector plan amendment to the MDR slash office land use classification per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7054)|

| 1:57:55| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Well, I was just going to move for the motion, but I am familiar with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| and I do agree that it's an excellent opportunity to get some multifamily housing or workforce type housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7081)|
| 1:58:10| It's got a bus route on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| You know, it's very well suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I like how they're going to be consolidating it up towards the road as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| and staying away from the hillside in the back to use the density up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| So all in favor of the motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7104)|

| 1:59:15| And the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| Agenda item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| Buffett Mill Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| Applicant developer R.D. Buffett, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| Location, south side of Buffett Mill Road, north side of McIntyre Road, eastern terminus of Montavista Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7173)|
| 1:59:41| Approximate acreage, 70.68 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| Zoning is RN2 hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| Existing land use, agriculture, forestry, vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| Proposed use, residential subdivision for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7192)|
| 1:59:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Number of lots, 290.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| And we will have, looks like one variance required and one alternative design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7204)|
| 2:00:15| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Staff recommendation motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| First motion is to approve the requested variance and alternative design standard based on the justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| provided by the applicant and recommendations of the City of Knoxville Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| Motion two, staff recommendation, approve the concept plan subject to 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| And do we have to act on the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| Okay, so we are withdrawing the special use application as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7244)|
| 2:00:52| That was already done previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Sorry, I forgot to change the proposed use, but it is not for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| It is just for single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7260)|
| 2:01:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| One other correction, I noticed it as soon as I opened it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| I noticed it, which is, you know, I probably looked this over 20 times before I actually printed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| It should be 15 conditions instead of 14 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| I accidentally put number four twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7277)|
| 2:01:18| 15 conditions and single family housing will be the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7278)|
| 2:01:27| Everybody got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7290)|
| 2:01:34| Councilor Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| Okay, we have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| If the opposition will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7305)|
| 2:01:54| Eric Mitchell, 1903 Locarno Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| I'm the president of the HOA for Buffett Trace Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7318)|
| 2:02:03| First and foremost, we would like to postpone the vote for today to see if we can meet with the developers to kind of work out some details as far as what they're planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7323)|
| 2:02:19| Some of the neighbors have some concerns and feel like they haven't been heard or considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| and some of the plans weren't updated online until Thursday just before Easter weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| so everybody in our community hasn't had a chance to really look over the plans to see what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7351)|
| 2:02:40| Some of our other concerns, traffic is a huge concern in the area, especially between Loves Creek and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7360)|
| 2:02:50| If you live in the area, you would know if the train stops on the railroad tracks between Spring Hill and Alt Road, the only access point is on Loves Creek through the underpass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7370)|
| 2:03:03| That backs up extremely bad in current conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| If we add another 290 units to the area between McIntyre and Buffett Mill, Loves Creek, the whole area will just gridlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7387)|
| 2:03:20| There's also some privacy concerns we would like to discuss with the developer as far as the entry point from Buffett Mill is going to run directly behind several of our lots there on Locarno.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7400)|
| 2:03:36| They have a walking path proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| Just some things we'd like to discuss with them to see if maybe they can reroute the walking path to where it's not directly behind certain units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7419)|
| 2:03:51| The pool in the clubhouse is also a concern as far as noise issues for the ones being located at the top of Locarno there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7431)|
| 2:04:02| and we're wanting to see if they could possibly add in some shrubs or some kind of fence line just to create some privacy between our subdivision and their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7442)|
| 2:04:17| And then also the proximity of their entry road to our entry road, I think it's less than 90 feet or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7457)|
| 2:04:28| It's coming up a hill kind of in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| We're concerned about a lot of our residents have expressed concern about pulling out onto Buffett Mill with another entry point so close by that it could cause traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7471)|
| 2:04:45| And that's all I have for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7489)|

| 2:05:08| We've been trying since January 24th to set up a meeting with the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| There was an original plan with the duplexes, as you mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| We were promised four times, I was promised four times during that process that we would have a meeting set up to discuss this with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7518)|
| 2:05:29| And finally, a week ago this past Monday, we were offered a Zoom meeting at 5 o'clock on Wednesday, and it gave me less than two days to put that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7529)|
| 2:05:43| So we're just asking basically for a postponement on this to where we can actually have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| We'd prefer to have a sit-down meeting with the developers to have some concerns on issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7550)|
| 2:05:59| Our Neighborhood Association has been doing this for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| We hadn't been here in front of you all on anything, but we've been here plenty of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| When we first started, Home Depot was being built, East Town was there, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7568)|
| 2:06:15| And if you've been anywhere near that area, you know what it's like now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| And the issues that are getting ready to come, and including the new Amazon Center, within a half a mile of Amazon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7579)|
| 2:06:27| there's proposed or actually being built over 1,500 housing units right now that are either proposed or being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7587)|
| 2:06:36| And we like to have a little word in what goes on in meetings with people in planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| because everything that's been done since those, including the Amazon Center since Home Depot, we've had a hand in helping planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7602)|
| 2:06:51| And that's all we ask is just a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| They add a postponement when they change their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| You even said it yourself, it read duplex, and that wasn't changed until two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7617)|
| 2:07:04| So if anybody had looked at it before, they'd have thought there's still duplexes going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| And we didn't find out until two weeks ago yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| There's 290 units on this single-family housing units, and every one of them are going to be rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7633)|
| 2:07:21| None of this will be sold. It's purely rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| That's huge for 290 individual units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| So we're just basically asking for a postponement. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| Mr. Collins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7653)|
| 2:07:44| I'm Pam Poteet. I live at 4900 Buffett Mill, and we are proud of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7664)|
| 2:07:51| When I moved there 31 years ago, our realtor tried to get us to move west, but we fell in love with the east-north area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7671)|
| 2:07:59| So with this development, I'm a realtor. I like development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| But I want to make sure that we're doing something that's going to accent, that will fit in with our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| We would like to meet with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| We just found out I was in Florida, came home yesterday, so I could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| That's how important it is to me for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| And we want to know if this is going to be rentals, what are they going to rent for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7701)|
| 2:08:26| What price point is it? What restrictions are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| Can they park RVs, semi-trucks, whatever boats in the yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| We want things to look nice for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| We would like to meet with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| And also, I've been spoiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| Where I live, I look over all the trees of this 80 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| I lived there 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| And I knew one day it would come and that would change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| But we want it to change where it's just going to fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| And we do have concerns with Buffett Trace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| I've looked at it and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| Their backyard butts right up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| And if they come out and sit on their patio, are they going to have cars zooming in and out all day long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| I do feel for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| On my side, on the left side of my house, is going to be the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| And, you know, what time will it be shut down for the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| Will there be kids there playing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| You know, we just don't want all this party noise going on all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| It's okay during the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| But we do have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Maybe move the pool into the middle of the subdivision to make it green, Knoxville's green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7772)|
| 2:09:39| Does everybody have to walk up the hill to the pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| Put it in the middle where it's kind of centralized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| You can have it fixed where handicap can drive their cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| There's just things we'd like to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| Maybe discuss to make it a happy medium, a win-win situation for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7790)|
| 2:09:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| And I wanted to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| Thank you all for having the Lord's Prayer and doing the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| I'm proud of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7808)|
| 2:10:12| Hi, I'm Damon Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| I live at 5020 Starbuck Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Yeah, we live basically at the bottom of that little curve down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| And I think most of the adjoining property to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| I know I haven't had a chance to meet with them in person at the property to kind of get more of an on-the-ground kind of feel on where the property line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7826)|
| 2:10:39| Just to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| May I encourage you to get a little closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| Oh, sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| Or you can raise that podium, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| There's a button to your right that will raise the podium if that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| But I know I have some concerns about possibilities of drainage issues because I know with some of the other buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7851)|
| 2:10:59| it might have caused more drainage to drain down onto that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| And I just want to make sure that it won't drain onto mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| And I haven't discussed anything about fencing or trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| And we just talked about a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| And I want to make sure that the greenway doesn't run smack dab right in front of my property there because, as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| the way that it's designed, there will be homes literally about 50 foot from the existing fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7881)|
| 2:11:29| And it might be an issue for privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| So I just want to make sure that there's a plan in place for trees, a fence, proper drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| And I also want to bring up the fact that some other people brought up about the traffic in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| I don't know if the fit would be a good fit with that many houses because you have Lowe's Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| and you've got Spring Hill, the remaining two fuel fairs through the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| And if you go down Spring Hill again, you've got the train that will block that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| The upper part, you've got a three-way stop that has numerous accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| It's a very, very blind hill going down Spring Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| So you have to watch out for oncoming traffic coming up or you can get side swiped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| especially if you're coming from the area where the new subdivision is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| So I'd like the city to probably take into account for that and maybe clear out some trees on Spring Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| where you can actually see down better or grade down part of the land on that one side maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| That might be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| If you don't care to wrap up, we're out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| But a postponement would probably be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7962)|
| 2:12:47| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| I'm here representing R.D. Buffett, LLC, on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| And I have been in communication with Mr. Collins since January on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7976)|
| 2:13:00| We filed our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| I was actually in communication with him before when we removed the planned development overlay on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| so we can develop consistent with the underlying RN2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| And our initial intent was to develop this for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| We went through a full engineering process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| We submitted that site under special use and a concept plan for the duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=7998)|
| 2:13:23| And we just couldn't crack the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| There were design issues with it that we just could not solve with the duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| We really wanted to be able to serve a different diversity of housing with duplexes here and could not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| So after two months of going back and forth with Mr. Reynolds and Curtis and the city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8016)|
| 2:13:43| we decided, all right, we're going to look at what can we do with single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| And so we threw away those plans, started from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| and came up with the plans now for 290 units for single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| And we didn't have any plans to share until March 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| And at that time there was an attorney representing Buffett Trace that looked at it and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| yeah, we don't have any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Apparently, I don't know if there was communication with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| I found out a couple days ago that they'd fired that attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| Mr. Mitchell is now the new HOA president, and they do have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| So we were scrambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| We were trying to communicate, but there was just some issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| And we're still willing to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| I had a long conversation with Ms. Poteet yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| She was driving up from Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| I had conversations with Mr. Mitchell's wife, Ashley, since he was working, about the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| And there's definitely things that we can address, especially with the walking trails and some of the privacy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| But just to put this concept, this is a concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8081)|
| 2:14:45| There's going to have to be additional engineering, additional permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| and you're going to have to come forward with a final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| This is 70.34 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| That's 290 units on 70 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| That comes out to 4.12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| Buffett Trace, by comparison, where Mr. Mitchell lives, and also there's 13.2 acres of common area in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8098)|
| 2:15:08| Buffett Trace is 83 units on 14.5 acres, which comes out to be about 5.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| So even though it's a larger development, 70 acres, it's less dense than what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8113)|
| 2:15:18| Staff's recommending approval subject to 15 conditions, all of which we are in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| There's been a complete traffic impact analysis that studied the surrounding intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| They did note Loves Creek and McIntyre is a substandard intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| It is before us. It's going to be after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| The level of service, though, isn't going to be dramatically impacted by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| And that's something I think that was talked about during the agenda review on Tuesday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8141)|
| 2:15:48| There's lots of talk about the pool house location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| If we could bring up maybe the landscaping plan, I don't know if you have that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| I have copies of it, too, if you need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| The pool at the top of the location there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| Mike, do you know if that's in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| Can we push files and I can hand these out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| That might be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Or that looks like that might be getting close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| T-Square Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Yeah, download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| There you go. Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| That's where the pool location is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| And the reason the road is located where it is, there is one of the variances is to allow for 109 feet of separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8183)|
| 2:16:33| between Locano and the entrance to this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| And staff is recommending, engineering is recommending that variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| and that's really because of the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| That's kind of sitting at the highest level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| and so you actually have better sight distance with the road at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| than you would if you moved it further west down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| So you see around the pool and clubhouse, the regulations require a Level B landscape screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| We exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| We've over-landscaped this because of the privacy concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| You can see some red maples and some evergreens that are going to be all around on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| both affecting the Buffett Trace community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| And Mr. Mitchell and Ashley Mitchell's house is actually the top one there on the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| and the Poteet's house is over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| And then we've got landscaping on each side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| The reason we put the pool location there is, well, that's the most narrow part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| It's the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| It's got great views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| It's probably the best place for just a common amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| If we were to move it in the middle, those displaced housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| we'd have to move it up here, and you would have different houses backing up to both the Poteet's property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| and Buffett Trace property line, and that would have its own privacy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| So being able to landscape it and design it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| it really felt like it made the most sense for both our development and for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| You know, the pool is going to be, I wrote it down here, I think it's about 225 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8279)|
| 2:18:08| The clubhouse is about 225 feet away from the Poteet residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| and it's pretty similar in size and scale to his neighbor, actually, on west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8291)|
| 2:18:18| You know, they have a large house and a pool that's actually closer to the Poteet's house than this one will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8298)|
| 2:18:23| So, you know, we're really trying to match what's already existing there with our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8303)|
| 2:18:32| Rental units, we can't decide rental units at a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8312)|
| 2:18:37| You know, whether it's going to be rented, it could be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| One of the conditions is that there will be an HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| There will be restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| We'll be happy to work with them about what restrictions they would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8324)|
| 2:18:47| We want to put the restrictions down to protect our investment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| And we can do a lot with the walking trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| That's one of the things we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| You can see on that plan where the walking trail kind of curves in, that can be moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| There's several opportunities we can move those things back so we're not so close to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| and we're willing to continue to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| I do wish there was more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| I do wish I could agree to a continuance, but we've kind of pushed this on pause because of design issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8351)|
| 2:19:18| We really need to get started on our development, but that doesn't mean we don't continue to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8358)|
| 2:19:25| They have my number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8365)|
| 2:19:26| They have my e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| Mr. Suggs is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| He's here, the local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| I've put him in contact, and he's agreed to meet him out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| I think the next meeting of the Buffett Trace HOA is in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8374)|
| 2:19:39| We've told them if you can get a special date, we'll come out and talk to them about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| and see what tweaks we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| You can't really do a dramatic redesign of a concept plan at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| but there's certainly things we can address the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| There's a lot of existing vegetation you can see in our concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| We're trying to keep as much of that existing vegetation around the periphery of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| to maintain that existing privacy, and that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8406)|
| 2:20:12| A developer doesn't want to clear vegetation they don't need to clear that might have to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| You want to try to keep the vegetation that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| So that's kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| Staff says they have a recommendation to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8422)|
| 2:20:26| It meets all the applicable subdivision and zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| I know there's concern about runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| It's always a concern when a new development comes into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| The standard is the post-development flows have to be equal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| or less than what's going off the property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| and we've engineered it in a way that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| We've got Mr. Chris Scholar in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| I'll move him closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| He can dig into the details if there's questions or concerns about that or the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| but we meet the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| We're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| We want to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| and we'll sit down and talk about things that can be tweaked before this thing goes to final plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8463)|
| 2:21:10| but we do ask that you follow staff's recommendation and approve it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| It sounds like there's a lot of things that have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| There were a number of things that the opposition said that they wanted to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| The applicant seems willing to address those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| but I think that that dialogue would probably be more productive before this is through planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8495)|
| 2:21:42| than after in terms of the community feeling like they have some ability to really impact any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| So I would be supportive of a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| It seems like 30 days is not a radical adjustment, but it would get away from holiday times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| You've got a new president to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| You've made adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| The plan was updated on the website, so it seems like a reasonable request from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8522)|
| 2:22:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| I don't want to call them opposition because what I heard throughout the whole course is that they're not opposed to development happening in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8535)|
| 2:22:25| What I think everyone's struggling with is lack of communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| lack of available time to absorb and really process and have some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8549)|
| 2:22:35| Again, I don't normally do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| I agree with my fellow commissioner on it, that I think 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| And the only reason I say that is because of all the people who spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| the one person that I know long history with, having grown up in that area, is Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8565)|
| 2:22:53| And Ronnie has been involved in everything in that community as long as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| And I just turned 44, so that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| I can remember before Home Depot was there, when the discussion, when Home Depot was going in, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8584)|
| 2:23:11| My parents were involved in all of that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| So I would strongly recommend that you really take them to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| If he says he's reached out and tried to get meetings, I take him at his word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| Because the one thing I can say about Ronnie is he's like a tick on a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| He's not letting go once he's got a hold of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| So, you know, meet with them, listen to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| My only other one is not consequential to anything with this whole project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| is that it's going to put a whole lot more people using my back end way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| going down Lovell Road to Kinzel Way to get into Walmart, so I don't have to sit on Millertown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| But that's the only thing, and that doesn't matter to any of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| Just make sure all the residents, if they move in there, if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| they go another way besides Kinzel, because I don't want it clogged up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8634)|
| 2:24:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| I'll make a motion to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| We have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| And we have a second from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| And, you know, while it's not a requirement to talk or negotiate with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8656)|
| 2:24:25| we do encourage it as a best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| And, you know, when you get off on the right foot in the beginning, it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| So let's take a vote and see where it lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| So we've got a motion and a second to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8685)|
| 2:24:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8698)|
| 2:25:07| Moving on to agenda item 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| Oh, postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| If that's all we get wrong today, we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| Agenda item 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| Taco Bell of America LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| Location north side of Kingston Park, west of Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| 1.02 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8733)|
| 2:25:34| Zoning CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Existing land use commercial and proposed use restaurant with a drive-thru facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| Staff recommendation is to approve the request for a drive-thru facility in CG1 zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| subject to the six noted conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| Anthony Barshanowicz with GPD Group on behalf of Taco Bell of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8761)|
| 2:26:06| Address is 1228 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8770)|
| 2:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8771)|
| 2:26:12| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| Would you like to proceed or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| We'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Could I ask that you raise the podium so we can hear you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8781)|
| 2:26:22| There's a button on the right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| Councilor Mullins, could you restore order in the rear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| Tiny buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| As you'll see in the staff report, there was some conditions for recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8800)|
| 2:26:50| I'm not going to go over them one by one, but I'd just like to go and point out some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8810)|
| 2:26:58| generalities about what we're going for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| It's for a special use permit for the drive-through itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| The property is currently zoned commercial and is appropriate for this lane use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8827)|
| 2:27:18| There was also a traffic study that was put together for this property that was also submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| to the jurisdiction for review for the driveway placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8843)|
| 2:27:30| And in relativity to that, the site is actually being improved from where it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8850)|
| 2:27:37| The existing building is only 17 feet away from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| We're increasing that to 48 feet to go and create a better sight line in each direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8862)|
| 2:27:47| on Kingston Pike for customers using the cars to get in and out of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8867)|
| 2:27:59| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| Lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| Taco Bell is also encouraging a pedestrian-friendly site by restoring the sidewalk up along Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8884)|
| 2:28:12| to a much more nicer, desirable form, as well as adding a bike rack to the front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8892)|
| 2:28:20| as well to encourage cyclists to go and park their bikes and lock them up safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8900)|
| 2:28:30| Reading through some of the commentary that was posted online, we did take into a lot of that consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8910)|
| 2:28:40| And there seemed to be some concerns with a lot of traffic being generated by Taco Bell itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8920)|
| 2:28:47| Again, this is a commercial property currently, and it's going to be a commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| if Taco Bell is allowed to proceed with their structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8932)|
| 2:29:01| Taco Bell Corporate actually owns several of the stores around the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| so we were able to pull numbers from area stores and average them all out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8945)|
| 2:29:13| There were some concerns, really, with time frame of school drop-off and pickup around the morning and the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8953)|
| 2:29:22| We took a look at those time frames along with when Taco Bell has their highest sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| and their highest sales are really during the lunch hour between 11 and 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| After that, their sales tend to plummet up until about 4.30 when it kind of picks up a little bit for the dinner service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| and then about 9 o'clock in the evening it just plummets, and there's not really a whole lot of traffic after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8979)|
| 2:29:48| So those are some items to consider for what might be the increase of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| but really it's really just for the lunch hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=8994)|
| 2:30:05| There were some concerns about the site and its proximity to the residential area that I believe is to the northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9005)|
| 2:30:13| if I'm looking at it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| The site currently sits about 13 feet lower in elevation than the residences behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9017)|
| 2:30:23| There is an existing retaining wall that will then be restored by the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| He's proposing to do a brand new one with a new fence on top to make it safe for anybody who's using that greenway behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9028)|
| 2:30:33| and for the students behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9033)|
| 2:30:38| With that said, with the building sitting as low as it is, it's not really going to be obtrusive as far as the site line is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9038)|
| 2:30:44| from the residential units behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| If there is any concern regarding site lighting, we can always propose new site lights that are going to be a little bit lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9049)|
| 2:30:56| so that way it won't have any kind of glaring effect to neighboring properties at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9056)|
| 2:31:05| Just to finish up, Taco Bell is committed to being a good neighbor, so we welcome any kind of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| We are flexible with different things to help promote being a good neighbor to not only the residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| but the school and the commercial properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9079)|
| 2:31:24| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| Do we have opposition? Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9089)|
| 2:31:38| Chris Baker, 219 Century Court. I am the property that is almost directly behind the proposed Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9098)|
| 2:31:45| Number 2, yes, 19, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| We're asking for at least a postponement of this for at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| Most of us, if you see the comments that were supposed to be printed out for you from yesterday, we were just made aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9116)|
| 2:32:03| We were told that there was five mailings sent out to the people on Century Court. Only one of those received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| We were also informed that Knox County School Systems was sent a mailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| However, the address on the tax card is invalid, so they did not receive that mailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| We would like to, again, at least postpone this so that there is time that not only Knox County can do a security and maintenance assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9140)|
| 2:32:30| on what the proposed improvement will do for the ingress and egress of traffic for the safety of the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| If you have ever been on Kingston Pike between Westwood Road and North Shore, it is gridlock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| It is gridlock at lunchtime. It is gridlock between 2 and 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| I live in the Westwood neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| We have had a traffic calming study done with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| Because of that gridlock, we have traffic that cuts through there all the way over to the interstate and to go down to Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9174)|
| 2:33:02| The traffic concerns definitely are our biggest concern for the school community and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9182)|
| 2:33:11| They talk about the different traffic times, but they are going to have two-lane drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9191)|
| 2:33:22| That drive-through right now is not currently approved through that current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| That is why they are asking for special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| There is a reason why it is not zoned that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| We had the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan that we did with the Knoxville Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9214)|
| 2:33:43| that states development along Kingston Pike east and west of the Holmberg Drive corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9223)|
| 2:33:48| consists of offices and large-scale commercial centers containing fast food restaurants and strip malls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| However, most of these establishments are going to be stable centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| Complete redevelopment does not seem likely within the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9236)|
| 2:33:59| For these areas to become more pedestrian friendly and fit into the Urbidge Village theme,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| the recommendations to the right should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| Orient buildings toward sidewalks and parking at back of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9245)|
| 2:34:09| Incorporate mixed-use between floors of buildings with commercial retail on first floor and office residentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| Require formal tree plantings along sidewalks and within parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| The only thing they have done in regards to our Bearden Village opportunity is plant trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| They have followed nothing else upon this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| The site plan itself creates possible external obsolences for these residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| As you see, the trash site is at the very rear of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| It is within 50 feet of the nearest property line behind there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| and within 10 feet of that greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9286)|
| 2:34:49| They sit lower than that greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| but yet they put their trash can as far away from their property as possible for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9292)|
| 2:34:57| The smell of trash from a Taco Bell would deter their customers if it was closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| so they are putting it at the very back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| Also, there are hours that they talk about that it drops off at 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| Most, if not all, of the businesses along this close at normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| Taco Bell is open until 2 o'clock in the morning for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9314)|
| 2:35:18| If their business dropped off at 9 and becomes dead, they would not stay open until 2 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9318)|
| 2:35:23| This would create undue noise and traffic concerns for not only our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9323)|
| 2:35:29| but everyone else along that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| We want revitalization of that said site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| It is an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| However, this improvement does nothing to bring value to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| only to itself, and does not improve the community in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| only further complicates the traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| We have pedestrians that walk their kids to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| If they are coming, their ingress and egress of their site is showing to turn out one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9351)|
| 2:35:58| Most Taco Bells have multiple ways of ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9358)|
| 2:36:02| We are seeing this issue on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| This is why there is a Knoxville ordinance within the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9365)|
| 2:36:08| that does not allow drive-thru restaurants on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| There have been discussions about the Starbucks on Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| the Chick-fil-A that is currently on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| that has multiple ingress and egress options and still backs up on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| This traffic will be horrendous for not only our school children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| but everyone else as far as the Westwood community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| that more people will cut through there to avoid this traffic that Taco Bell causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| We implore you to decline, if not at least postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| that we can have further discussions with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| as well as get Knox County School System involved for further assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9402)|
| 2:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9407)|
| 2:36:48| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| Do we have other opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| Good afternoon. My name is Raymond Levitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| Are you guys okay to extend a couple of minutes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| I live at 5817 Tool Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| And Chris has covered much of what I was going to, so I will limit my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9424)|
| 2:37:12| Essentially, first of all, I'm a long-time resident of the neighborhood of Westwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| which abuts the business district of Kingston Pike in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9438)|
| 2:37:27| I don't believe the commission has obtained sufficient input from the parties who will be most impacted from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9447)|
| 2:37:37| And I'm not familiar with your policies or procedures for how you distribute information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9457)|
| 2:37:46| and collect information, but I can say that in my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9466)|
| 2:37:52| we have seen no public notices of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9472)|
| 2:37:58| and a handful of people at best have received advisement cards in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| I've seen no notices on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| and I've not seen any public notices posted on the two buildings that if demolished for the Taco Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9487)|
| 2:38:17| that will be demolished if this goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9497)|
| 2:38:20| So basically we've all been, in our neighborhood and vicinity, we've all been caught off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9500)|
| 2:38:27| And I think that's clearly reflected in the public comments that you have received recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9507)|
| 2:38:33| Up until April 11th, there had been only two public comments on the commission's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9513)|
| 2:38:39| In the past two days, there have been 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| So you've got quite a bit of information there to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9522)|
| 2:38:49| and I really doubt that, well, I doubt that most of you have had time to peruse those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| Those comments contain some pretty significant information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| and I think they raise safety issues that are legitimate and should be given serious consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9539)|
| 2:39:09| And I think that in view of that, a postponement of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| or excuse me, the assessment of this should be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| If you could wrap up, sir, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| So essentially that's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| I request or request that you postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| and in the alternative I request that the application be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9574)|
| 2:39:35| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9576)|
| 2:39:39| Okay, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9583)|
| 2:39:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| Josh Burnett, 135 South Forest Park Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9589)|
| 2:39:54| I'm the vice president of people's development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| and I just want to make it clear that what we're asking for is just use on review for the drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9597)|
| 2:40:02| This isn't about Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| It's about a drive-through, which would be consistent with everything else that's happening in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9604)|
| 2:40:09| If you zoom out from this document here that you should have in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| there's three different drive-throughs in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| One is next door, which is a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| It's a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| I don't really think a Taco Bell drive-through is going to increase traffic on Kingston Pike in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9632)|
| 2:40:38| and I don't personally feel like it's a detriment to the area, so I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| We approve the request for a drive-through facility in the CG1 zoning district per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9643)|
| 2:40:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| Okay, we've got a motion to approve per staff recommendation by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9652)|
| 2:40:59| We have more lights and more discussion, so let's go to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9659)|
| 2:41:06| And I'm not going to oppose it, but I just happened to notice, because going back to several things we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9666)|
| 2:41:13| and they brought up a good point, the fact that they are open until 2 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9673)|
| 2:41:16| and I didn't notice in any of the conditions about any light shields to make sure that the neighborhood behind doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| excessive light spill from parking lot lights and stuff that go on until 2 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| I didn't notice that in a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| But then I also noticed, while I was thinking about that, that Mr. Murphy isn't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| and I'm wondering if we should do a welfare check, because I don't think he's ever missed a meeting that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| So that was just a question for staff if the parking lot light consideration had come into play to make sure that the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9699)|
| 2:41:48| right behind don't have excessive light spill up until 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| I did not consider it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| The city has pretty robust lighting standards in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| It requires full cutoff lights, and this property will be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| Okay, I guess I did mention that it had to meet the lighting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9729)|
| 2:42:14| But, yeah, the city has a pretty robust lighting requirement, so I wasn't too concerned from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9734)|
| 2:42:26| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Thank you, Chairman Hale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| As we've all witnessed in the last couple days, the amount of interest from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| And I am a resident of that neighborhood, been there probably longer than anybody in the room, 43 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9758)|
| 2:42:45| So I'm well aware of the traffic issue on Kingston Pike, especially the issues with the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9765)|
| 2:42:51| since we've got two school facilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| And there was a sign originally posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| I don't know how long it stayed up, but it has not been there in quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9777)|
| 2:43:03| I was not aware of the project until the initial applications came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9783)|
| 2:43:09| So I would support a postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| I can't at this point agree to approve the project as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| I think the business needs to communicate with the neighborhood and get some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9797)|
| 2:43:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9804)|
| 2:43:32| I raised this issue at agenda review, and seeing 101 comments come in since then certainly hasn't allayed my concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9812)|
| 2:43:42| that I recognize that this is a review on a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9822)|
| 2:43:47| And my issue is with a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| So I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| I can't see how this could help in terms of the extreme congestion that that area experiences pretty much all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9832)|
| 2:44:00| but definitely during the 11 to 4.30 time period until 6.30 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9840)|
| 2:44:07| So I just can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| Thanks, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| So a couple of things I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| In the packet, in the report that Mike presented, there was a comment about the Bearden Opportunities Plan being limited to the Homburg area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9857)|
| 2:44:28| Myself, as well as Chairman Hill, are part of the Bearden Village community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9868)|
| 2:44:34| and we've been involved in implementing this Bearden Opportunities Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| And I will say that that area of pedestrian orientation is not limited to just the Homburg area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9877)|
| 2:44:44| It actually, through Creeks and Pike, starts at Western Plaza and continues all the way to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9884)|
| 2:44:51| There was a comment about it being already an auto-oriented area with the car wash and the Firestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9891)|
| 2:45:00| I went back and looked at the years that those were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| It looks like the Firestone has been there since 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| and I'm assuming that that was a use-by-right during the old zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| The car wash was at least from 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| Again, that was before the previous, before Recode Knoxville, before the zoning ordinance was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| And if you go back and look at both of those uses-by-right, both the car wash and the auto center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| those are now special uses as well as the drive-through, and that's why we're here right now trying to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9930)|
| 2:45:38| You know, I drive through that area quite a bit, and everyone here knows about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9938)|
| 2:45:45| But I don't think there's any area that should be more pedestrian-centric than around a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9945)|
| 2:45:51| And the fact that this is a piece of property that is creating an auto-centric area in front of a school, I just can't support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9951)|
| 2:46:02| You know, I live much further than the residents in Westwood and the residents across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9962)|
| 2:46:07| and I know there's no bus service in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| So that means elementary kids, if they don't have a ride, they're walking up the greenway to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9971)|
| 2:46:16| as well as all the other students that are in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| And I don't believe that this provides for a safe environment for the kids in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| for people who are on the greenway, and I'm not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9984)|
| 2:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| Yeah, Mike, thank you for the clarification on the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| I was a little bit worried about that as well, but I do understand that the city really leans more towards the night sky compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=9996)|
| 2:46:43| you know, with the full cutoff luminaires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| So I do appreciate you answering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| As far as the traffic, we all know it really gets to be a problem in that area on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10007)|
| 2:46:52| But my experience is a lot of these uses, Taco Bell or, you know, Pick One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| I mean, it really services the traffic that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| I don't know how much it's going to be drawing in particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10020)|
| 2:47:04| I know it has some peak times that are higher and less than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10024)|
| 2:47:08| But generally, I mean, that's why these businesses want to locate on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| is because the traffic count is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| One thing I did notice, again, getting back to the issue that this is really just about a drive-through and is it appropriate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10035)|
| 2:47:25| one thing I did notice on here, somebody correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10045)|
| 2:47:29| but it looks like where you've got the drive-through intercoms are located on the western side of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10049)|
| 2:47:39| which is towards the car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| They're not traditionally, you know, a lot of times they put them directly behind the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| which would be much more intrusive, I think, to the neighbors when people are coming through there and ordering any food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10064)|
| 2:47:51| But they are around the corner, so I think that helps me to be able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10071)|
| 2:47:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| Commissioner Schell, so I don't think I have anything else to add after everyone's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230413?start=10086)|
