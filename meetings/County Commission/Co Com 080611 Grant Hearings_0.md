| 0:01:03| Twelve members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| Next on our agenda is the Metropolitan Drug Commission Youth Action Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=66)|
| 0:01:25| Hey, hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| Somebody switch seats with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| You switch seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Crappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| I'm Leah Adanoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=104)|
| 0:01:45| I live at 2400 Middlebrook Ridge Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| I work for the Metropolitan Drug Commission, which is at 5908 Lyons View Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| I'm Carrie Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| I live at 5225 Buckhead Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| And we are here today on behalf of the Knoxville-Knox County Mayor's Youth Action Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| And the first thing I want to do is just say thank you to County Commission and to Commissioner Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| for giving us the opportunity to come today and tell you just a little bit more about our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| We know that, you know, the county budget and use of taxpayer funds, stewardship of those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| is not a job to be taken lightly, and we just appreciate what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| And we appreciate also what the panel volunteers have already done and the decisions that they've come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| We know that that took a lot of time and consideration, and we appreciate and respect the job that they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=149)|
| 0:02:36| However, we also feel like maybe some information was not conveyed to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| and so we want to just make you aware of some things that they may not have been aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| and appeal to you to include the Mayor's Youth Action Council in the 2008-2009 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| The Youth Action Council has been a partnership between the city and the county mayor's offices for four years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| In fact, the council was established to be the representative body for teens in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| in order to provide a youth perspective to the city and the county mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| as well as other local officials who work on behalf of teens and teen issues, issues that affect teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| The council, although we are here to provide opinions of youth and provide that youth perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| they're not sitting idly by just waiting for someone to give them a call and ask them what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| They are an action council. Action is in their name for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| They are constantly devising ways, devising activities to engage young people in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| in community service and local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| That is kind of what they're here to do, provide a link between local government and the teens of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| They work on behalf of teens for systemic and cultural change as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| In other words, they're trying to provide methods, avenues for teens to voice their opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| and for those opinions to be considered seriously in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| So that is kind of what the Youth Action Council stands for, and I have Carrie Cox here with me from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| She is the current chairperson of the Youth Action Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| She's going to tell you a little bit about what we do and what we've accomplished in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| The Mayor's Youth Action Council is a voice for the youth of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| We strive to promote youth engagement in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| which we hope will ultimately create a better informed and more participatory generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| We are essentially facilitators for a greater change and work towards this by reaching out to every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| and mobilizing as many students as we can around issues that matter to teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| In the past, the Youth Action Council has helped lobby for school funding reform at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| created a student representative position on the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| and met with officials to discuss the role of teens within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Every year, the Youth Action Council hosts a youth summit that mobilizes hundreds of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| to involve themselves in community service and local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| There are over 13,000 teens in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| and the Mayor's Youth Action Council helps these teenagers understand their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| speak up about their opinions, and get involved in the world around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| So just as you 18 representatives represent the 450,000 folks living here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| these teenagers hope to be the representation or the voice for the 13,000 plus teenagers that live here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| Our program has requested and received annually about $15,000 from Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| and that helps to supply the efforts that she talked about like the youth summit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| and other programs that they do throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| The accomplishments that Carrie did mention are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| they would not be possible without the support of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| so this partnership is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| We view the Youth Action Council as a program, truly a program, of city and county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| and the Metropolitan Drug Commission houses and administers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Some of you may be aware that the Youth Action Council was housed and administered by the United Way previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| and MDC took that on in 2007 with the assurance that the level of support would remain the same from city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| So we're hoping, we're humbly asking that you reconsider inclusion of the Youth Action Council in the county budget this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=367)|
| 0:06:16| and we'll be happy to take any questions that you have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| Leah, I'd like for some of the action members just to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| We have six members here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| There are currently 26 representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| They're from every public high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Every public high school is in some way represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| I'll say with halls, we have a student who takes classes at halls, but is not actually a student at halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| Every public high school, two private high schools and home school are all represented on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| I guess I need another full exclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| I'm their advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| That one's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Disabled veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Hospital coordinator and transportation network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=424)|
| 0:07:23| He could do it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Brian, do you have a microphone right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=447)|
| 0:07:40| Hi, I'm Linda Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| I'm with the Disabled American Veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| I'm the hospital coordinator at the Knoxville Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| I'd like to thank Knox County for all their contributions that they have with the DAV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| This last year, if it were not for Knox County helping us out on monies, we would not be able to provide van programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| And I have Harry Dexter who's going to talk about our van programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| At this time, we're running three vans out of the Knoxville Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| We're transporting patients not only to Nashville, but also to the hospital at Mountain Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| And we're transporting anywhere from 30 to 50 patients a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| And these are folks that can no longer drive or do not have the transportation to get to their appointments at these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=507)|
| 0:08:37| As you know, Knoxville does not have a VA hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| We only have a clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| And it has the limited facilities that requires the transportation of quite a few of our veterans to the other hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=524)|
| 0:08:57| where they can receive the treatment that they require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| Right now, Knox County and Knoxville City has 36,859 veterans in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| It's going to be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| There is, for a compensation of pension this last year, we brought in $29,335,851, new monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=552)|
| 0:09:24| So the programs for our veteran programs are really essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| Do I have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| It sounds like we need to get Mr. Dexter's address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| We need to get your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| It's 3351 Coffman, C-O-F-F-M-A-N, Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| On the top salaries, it says NPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| The what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| For the top salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| No paid salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| The Tennessee Department of, I mean, the DAV National pays their national service officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| The state is who I work for, the state of DAV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| and they have six service officers that they pay and one secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| but all of the other employees are volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Thank you for what you do, by the way, and the service that you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| How many veterans would you say that utilize your van services and utilize your facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| Well, on the van services, just last year, and this is only 11 months that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| we ran 730 veterans to and from their appointments, and that was in 11 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| On the claims compensation, I did 1,628 claims in this last year, strictly out of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=642)|
| 0:10:53| That's not counting what Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs does, nor the county service officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| And I am the only service officer in the clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| and if anybody has any volunteers that they would like to send my way, I would be more than happy to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Kasa of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=676)|
| 0:11:36| My name is Carolyn Doty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| I'm Executive Director of Kasa of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| We are located at 2200 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| We serve four counties, Knox, Sevier, Blount, and Hamlin counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| Kasa stands for Court Appointed Special Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| and we advocate for neglected and abused children who are brought in through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| Most of these children are placed in foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| A number of them are placed with relatives or back with their families under a monitoring plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| We are a volunteer-based organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Our volunteers receive very specialized training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| and they, in turn, advocate for the most vulnerable members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| to make sure that they have the services they need while in foster care or in another placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| to make sure that their case is heard in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| and to make sure that they are in a safe and appropriate placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| These cases are very complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| They require a lot of investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| These children really require a lot of care to make sure that they do not fall through the cracks of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=773)|
| 0:13:03| Judge Irwin and his referees at juvenile court do a wonderful job making decisions about the well-being of these children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| but they are so overstressed and so overburdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| The whole system is that these volunteers provide a critical, essential service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| Kasa is not a mentoring program or an enhancement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| It is an essential core service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| And not only is it essential to these children, but it's one of the best bangs for the buck out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=811)|
| 0:13:41| Our volunteers essentially provide about $3,500 a year worth of services to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| and we serve our children for about $500 to $750 per child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| So it is a tremendous asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Child abuse rates have recently risen 50% in the past two years in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| There's a huge need for services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| and we are very appreciative that the county has helped us provide this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=848)|
| 0:14:17| We're very grateful for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| and we hope to be able to expand our program this year in order to meet the growing need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| Any questions about Kasa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| How many cases would you say you worked last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| We served around 300 children last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| And when I say we served a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| that means that that child has a person dedicated to his or her case throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=882)|
| 0:14:52| monitoring that case, attending every DCS meeting, every court proceeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=892)|
| 0:15:01| visiting that child once a month, going to that child's school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| We're not talking about a couple of encounters with the child or a couple of sessions with the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| We're talking about a person who is dedicated to that child's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| and makes sure that that child does not fall through the cracks and has what he or she needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| That was going to be my next question, is this is not a short-term thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I mean, when you're dealing with these types of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| you're looking at months, maybe even a year or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Oh, it's typically a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| It's often three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| So this is a long-term commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| and our volunteers follow the children through until they have a placement in a permanent situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| either back with their parents under a rehabilitation scenario or with a relative adoption or some other adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=946)|
| 0:15:56| So our goal is to see the child in a permanent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| And our children reenter the system at a later date at a rate that's just less than 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=961)|
| 0:16:15| So it's an extremely effective and cost-effective program for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| I just wanted to say thank you, Carolyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| And also I know that you provide an essential service for the judicial judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| in that you help to research and do a lot of the legwork for them to help them with the disposition of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| And that is so critical to try to help make sure that these cases move through the system and they're not stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| Because when you're dealing with children and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| you have people that really want decisions made right now and not two years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| And so I really wanted to say thank you and appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Airplane Filling Station Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1021)|
| 0:17:09| I'm Kay Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| I live at 1501 Bradshaw Garden Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| I'm here to represent the Airplane Filling Station Preservation Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| I'd like to say thank you for letting us come and speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| I'd also like to thank you for your previous support in giving us a grant in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| that helped us purchase the land for this particular filling station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| This organization is a group of people, unpaid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| that have gotten together to try to preserve a historic landmark in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| And there's all kinds of debates about that, as you know, and get involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| But this particular one is kind of unique in that it is what's known as mimicked architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| It is an airplane that was built to look like an airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| It served as a filling station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| It's on Clinton Highway, headed out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| It's on the left just past the Wal-Mart there on U.S. Highway 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| At the time, in 1930 when it was built, it was a very busy highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| It was our Interstate 75 at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| And so two people had a vision, Elmer and Henry Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Nichols to build this and to make it unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| It takes visionaries to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| And it took some visionary people a few years ago to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| if we don't do something, this will go away, this will die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| A good wind come along, it would have been gone already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| But they decided it was unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| There's only two such mimicked architectures like this in the East Tennessee area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| One is in Bristol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| It's a big guitar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| It seems to me it should be in Nashville, but it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| And then we have this one here that is an airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| And what we wanted to do is to take care of it, restore it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| to make it either a tourist attraction, if you will, sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| a possible office for a location of someone in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| We have undertaken to have it designate a historical landmark, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| We now have established it as a nonprofit organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| and fundraising activities are ongoing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| They have undertaken to stabilize the tanks that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| and they are now certified stabilized in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| and not an environmental threat to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| That's been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| A lot of cleanup and debris has been taken away from the site that has been deposited there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| It continues to be collected there from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| and they routinely do that to keep the site clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| We have undertaken to stabilize the wings, which were held up by a wing in a prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| no pun intended, because they had deteriorated over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| such that they were just about to collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And so they have been stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| And if any of you have been by recently, you'll see that it looks neat now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| It's got a fresh coat of paint, and a lot of work has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| We are continuing to try to take care of this historical site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| preserve it, and make it a functional part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| To do that, it takes money, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| And we'd like to ask you to consider our grant request again this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| to help us to continue to do the things that need to be done to preserve this airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| Some people say, well, what good is an airplane that doesn't fly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Well, if it's a National Historic Landmark, very unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| and in our backyard, we think it's worth preserving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| and we'd like to ask your continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Can I ask one question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| You had said that you'd received grant donations in the past, but it doesn't list it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| We have a spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| How much grant dollars have you received in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We have received 15,000 from this group that helped us purchase the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| That went a long way to purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| We have a state grant that has been approved, but we don't have the funds actually coming in yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| and that's a matching fund for 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| We've had various donations from people to which we've had to match some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| We had like a $5,000 donation to us if we matched it, and we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| So we've had some small fundraising activities that are not formal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| but we have some others that are into the state again for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| When did commission give you that 15,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| In 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Excuse me, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| 2005 is when you bought it, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| 2005, I'm sorry, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| I just want to say I've had a very unique opportunity being in such close proximity to this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| to have seen what work this group has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| and they have gone a long ways in shoring up this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| And I do appreciate the work that you've done, because had you not done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| that strong wind would have blown it over on my side of the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| We're neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| The other thing is it's no longer an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| It's actually kind of neat to see nowadays, and it was an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| And very soon, we've got one little stabilization issue we'd like to clear up before we open it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| but we'd like in the future, perhaps at Dogwood Arts Festival time or perhaps during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| open it up for people to see what work we have going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| and let it become part of the attractions for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| It's something unique that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Safe Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1354)|
| 0:22:49| Hello. I'm Jane Peoples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| I'm the executive director of Safe Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| On my left is Holly Fuqua, our financial officer for Safe Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| We actually were awarded dollars through the community grant funding process in two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| One was health care, and one was education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| We are here to ask that those funds remain in place for the very significant work that we are doing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1390)|
| 0:23:19| Safe Haven Center runs and is the only option in Knox County for a victim of sexual assault crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| to receive a forensic nursing exam to gather the evidence needed to hold the perpetrator in accountability for their crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1407)|
| 0:23:42| That first 72 hours is very critical, and it costs Safe Haven about $1,000 to provide services for that first 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1422)|
| 0:23:53| We have other grants that help us beyond that first 72,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| but we are seeking help from the county to provide that services for the critical first 72 hours after a sexual assault crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1436)|
| 0:24:06| I would like to tell you the bad news is that last weekend we had four additional sexual assaults here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| so that we are up to about 55 sexual assaults in Knox County since January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1455)|
| 0:24:22| and 13 of those were children between the ages of 13 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| We were awarded $14,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| That, if you use the $1,000 benchmark, will pay for 14 of the victims that have already been through our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| So it's critical that we remain a partner with the county to provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| The other program is our school-based education program where we teach children kindergarten through 11th grade child safety skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1490)|
| 0:25:00| We have had, last year, two-thirds of the elementary schools that we went into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| we had children disclose to us that they were being sexually abused at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| So we believe that this is a very big marker of a system that is not in addition to but mandated through the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1510)|
| 0:25:19| and has been a wonderful opportunity for us to find out and learn who those children are that are being sexually abused at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1519)|
| 0:25:27| As one of the students said to us, I believe this program should be shown to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| I feel this program is a good influence and teaches kids about staying away from unsafe adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| We can't ask for a better recommendation for our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| So what we're here to do is just thank you for the award and just implore you to leave it in place so that we can do the work that we have started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1545)|
| 0:25:55| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1563)|
| 0:26:13| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| I'm Phyllis Nichols, the President and CEO of the Knoxville Area Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| and I'd like to thank County Commission for allowing us the opportunity today to spend a few moments with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| and share what we do and our thoughts on the community grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| Rather than rehash the process and anything that non-profits may feel that was wrong with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| I would like to emphasize today the importance of non-profits for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| Non-profits do the work that government cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| We do it in an efficient way, a very effective way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| but the point I want to raise today is that in times of economic uncertainty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| those are the times when the community needs non-profits most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| The Urban League has a – our request was for our Workforce Development Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| We have, since 1968, been helping the unemployed and the underemployed to find employment opportunities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1630)|
| 0:27:22| Our program has a return on its investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| For the investment of Knox County, we are able to place people into job opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1646)|
| 0:27:35| where they return to the county sales taxes, and then in a secondary program, we also are preparing homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| We can't do the work that we do without the support of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1663)|
| 0:27:54| What we're able to do with this support is to leverage it for other fundings that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| There has to be some type of foundational support that we have to leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| because the amount that we get from Knox County doesn't support our whole program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| It is a critical part of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| We did receive some funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| It was about a 62% cut, which greatly impacts our ability to serve the people that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1699)|
| 0:28:28| Since January of 2008, the clients coming to the Urban League have increased by 256%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1708)|
| 0:28:38| That is people who are looking for work, people who are underemployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| and also people who are having housing challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Again, the point I'd like to emphasize to you is, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| we appreciate the value that Knox County places on nonprofits, the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| In tough economic times, it's not the time to cut to nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| because we are the safety net for the people who are in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| We are often used as a source of referral for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| Many referrals come from the Office of Community and Housing in Knox County to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1755)|
| 0:29:22| We have been partners for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| And I'm here to answer any questions that commission may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| regarding our work and the support that we receive from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| Ma'am, I don't see where you've requested any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| They're under Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| They moved it from Knoxville to Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| They're under Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| It's in the book here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| They moved from Knoxville to Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| In the past, it was Knoxville, and they moved it to Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| It still should be Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| It is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| It's in there both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| It's in there both ways, Knoxville and Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Item 96 on the spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Thank you, Phyllis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| I said on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Lawrence Crittenden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Not that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Not this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Not this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Not this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Not that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Don't you get in my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Oh, it's not on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| It's this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Hey, open the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| My name is Seal Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| I'm President and CEO of the Florence Crittenden Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Florence Crittenden Agency is a multifaceted nonprofit whose mission is to serve the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| and strengthen the community in which we live by providing effective prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| and treatment programs for young women and children and pregnant young women and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1860)|
| 0:31:10| The program that I wanted to talk with you about today is called the Child and Parenting Skills Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| This is an abuse and neglect prevention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| It's targeted at high school students, both boys and girls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| who are pregnant or parenting a child under three years of age and they're still in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| It is a school-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| and one of the things that we really value about this program is that in the 18 years of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| not one child whose parents have been participating in this program have been reported for abuse or neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1906)|
| 0:31:57| So our record stands on itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| We have a program coordinator who teaches parenting education skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| who teaches child development information so that these young parents who are at great risk of abusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| or neglecting their child can learn what it is to be a good parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| And so how does that affect Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Well, obviously children who are born to teen parents have a much greater risk of growing up in a home where poverty exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1942)|
| 0:32:34| in a home where the parents have not completed their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Tax dollars are reduced because these young people typically don't get a high school education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| So that affects you and me as taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| It also affects the strength of our community because children who are born to teen parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| without some intervention are much more likely to participate in a life of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| So it really has abuse and neglect of children has a very, very wide-ranging effect on us as a society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1981)|
| 0:33:11| And so we are coming to you today to ask for $5,000 to go along with the other $25,000 that we get through a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=1991)|
| 0:33:20| from the state of Tennessee to prevent child abuse and neglect among this population of very at-risk children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2000)|
| 0:33:30| whose parents are still in high school and whose immaturity and lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| and family situation itself make them at great risk of abusing and neglecting their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| And this is a program that stops abuse and neglect before it ever gets started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| So I open it up to questions if you all have any questions about this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| Seeing none, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| CAC, Barbara Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| I'm Barbara Kelly and I'm the Executive Director of the Community Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| And first of all, I wanted to thank you on behalf of the families and the seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| and the children that we serve at CAC for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| Without Knox County's support and the matching funds that you provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| much of what we accomplish at CAC, almost all of it, would not be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| I think you all know that, but it cannot be said too often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| Secondly, I want to thank you for making this opportunity available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| The democratic process is time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| You know that better than I, and I appreciate your generosity in making this opportunity available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| And I'd also like to thank the citizens who stepped forward to be part of a new allocations process this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| for their time and their effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| I wanted to give you some information and background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| about the Senior Citizens Information Referral Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| and Computers for Homebound Isolated Persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| We call them SCIRS and CHIPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Both of these programs were freestanding 501c3s out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| before they came under the CAC umbrella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| The SCIRS board went through a long process before deciding that it would be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| and cost-effective to disband as a separate private agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| and become part of the Office on Aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| Both of these organizations received community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| when they were separate freestanding organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and the expectation is that that would continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Both of these programs help people help themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| with good and accurate information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Many people are able to take care of themselves and their family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| They can postpone or eliminate the need for more costly service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| Senior Citizens Information and Referral staff, they listen carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| and their expertise is providing people with the information that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| even if they are not able to ask the right question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| They're good listeners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| CHIPS is an organization run entirely by volunteers who use donated computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| to help homebound and isolated persons stay connected with the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| It's a cost-effective way to promote self-help and independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| I have not come here today to make any specific request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| I just wanted to offer the words of thanks that I opened with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| and to bring these programs to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| and explain a little bit about how they came to be part of CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| and I thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Thank you, Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| I also brought the new version of the Senior Citizens Directory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| It's the 0709, and if any of you do not have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| I guess we'll leave some here, or if you raise your hand, I'll make sure you get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| It's relatively new, and it's just packed full of good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| So we brought some of those if anybody would like to have them, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| TenCorp Community Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2263)|
| 0:38:07| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| My name is Jacqueline T. Collins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| and I am the Executive Director of TenCorp Community Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| and we are the Freedom Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| I thank you for giving me this opportunity to come before you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| We have moved to a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2305)|
| 0:38:29| We are located now at 2200 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| next to the new health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| We have started our program on June 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| and we have 40-plus students enrolled at this present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| With the requested support from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| we will be able to complete our program that is in progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| and continue to offer the program to our participants who are really in need this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| We have some special need families that have enrolled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| and with your contribution we'll allow them to complete the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| I thank you again for your invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I thank you for your generous contributions before, and this is my ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2360)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Lynn Chapel Senior Night, night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2374)|
| 0:39:44| John Sevier Home Memorial Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| My name is David Daly, and I'm the site manager for the Governor John Sevier Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| The park is called Marble Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| It's a state historic site owned by the state, run by a nonprofit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| called the John Sevier Memorial Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| All state historic sites in the state are run this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| They're owned by the state and run by a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| We've asked for the grant from Knox County to extend and expand our educational programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| which we call 18th Century Workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| We have these workshops to teach the community various 18th century skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| soap making, candle making, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| We don't want these skills and arts to die and to tell the truth, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| These days people don't need to know how to make their own soap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| but we like to teach children and adults these various skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2446)|
| 0:40:56| We get approximately a quarter of our yearly budget from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| The rest of it we have to earn on our own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| so this money greatly helps us with the running of the park also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| Four years ago this state historic site, the only state site in the county, was closed due to bad management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2472)|
| 0:41:21| We have come a long way from there in improving the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| I have recently traveled around the state visiting other state historic locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| seeing how they're run and how they're managed and getting help from some of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| The John Sevier Memorial Association also participates with the other six historic homes in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| in our programming and various fundraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| Is that John Sevier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Are there any questions? Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| I just wanted to ask what your budget was, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Our budget, we got $42,000 from the state last year and $7,000 from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2531)|
| 0:42:20| That's your total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| That's our total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| It costs about $100,000 to run the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2547)|
| 0:42:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Cades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| A-D-E-S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| I know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Yeah, I'll disclose that it is at the church that I'm a member of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Concord United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| It's a little bit like the Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| People were here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| It's like an adult daycare that's there at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| It's a very good program and very much needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| But I just wanted to disclose that that is at the, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| it's getting a lot of money from Concord United Methodist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| and I am a member of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| It's under Community School of Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| It shouldn't have been there, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Right up under Community School of the Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| Clinton Chapel Senior Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| Right above it, Clinton Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I'm speaking on behalf of Mary Ann Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| actually the chair of Clinton Chapel Senior Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| She wanted me to come on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| She was sort of confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| She didn't receive a letter stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| if she was awarded anything or if she was awarded something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| But she did receive a letter saying that if she wanted to come talk on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| I apologize, I was running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| For her defense, that this was a very good program that she holds yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| This will be her 13th year holding for Seniors Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| For senior citizens in the community, it's open to all community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| I know that when she spoke before, she stated that this was for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and it started out, she got the inspiration from her grandmother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| and she was honoring seniors in her church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| And why it's called Clinton Chapel Seniors Night Out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| they became the host of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| They thought that was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| She started getting donations from the community from different types of vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| people matching grants and people giving monies at her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| My mother works for Regions Bank, and she just gets donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| And this opportunity came on her two years ago to actually ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| when the county mayor at the time had his forefront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| leaving no seniors behind or having the initiative about senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| that piece sort of helped her to actually give out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| This is held primarily, she sends invitation out to all senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| and how she gets seniors to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| She sends letters out to urban churches to ask for two senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| to come represent their church at this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And it's a way of just telling them thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| She knew that there was like the grandest grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| but unfortunately some of the people that do attend her seniors night out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| they can't afford to go to the grandest grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| or that's by nomination process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| So she's just wanting to recognize all senior citizens in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| and they must RSVP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| They get a free meal, and they usually typically leave with two or three gifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| whether it be gift certificates or large items, which are big screen TVs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| things that senior citizens like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| And she just wanted me to appeal on her behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| saying that she would hope that you would honor a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I don't know what it was, but something just to help for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| because most of the money goes for either paying for the meal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| and or helping get these items for senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| And I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I'm not sure what she really wanted me to say on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Commissioner, for your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| the past few years it's under seniors night out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| and this year it's under Clinton Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Excuse me, Diane, I don't know why the switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| She has a committee of volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| and they just thought they would get more donations from by having a church sponsor it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| because she does get all those senior citizens come by sending letters out to these churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| and saying, would you send two members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| And our church decided that they would be willing to let their name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| or at least use a tax write-off whenever they buy these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| But because she's a member there, I guess, they just decided to be the host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| That was just for their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Next up, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| I just wanted to tell you, you did a great job speaking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| And no need to be nervous around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| We only bite each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| I just didn't know what she anticipated from her laryngitis and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2893)|
| 0:48:21| Other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| And you were on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| We were running a little early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| About 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| Did I say K's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Oh, yeah, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Yeah, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| Knoxville Botanical Gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| So is Kate's not going to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| We're representing the Knoxville Botanical Gardens and Arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| I'm Anna Ford and this is Carlton Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| We're on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| For those of you that don't know where it is, it's in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| It was the old Howe Nursery, which was originally established in 1786.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| It's the longest continuing business in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| It is in a low-income neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| In the year 2000, a group of concerned citizens bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| The Howe family could no longer keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| It's 44 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| And we have been busy trying to convert it into a wonderful botanical garden and arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| We are in the process of hiring an executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| In the past, the county has been very supportive, and we, of course, need that continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| At present, we have a foundation that has been very generous, and we have gotten matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| And we are eagerly working on getting this garden going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| It had 44 acres of brush and underbrush and kudzu, and we need to clear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| It helps this depressed neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| We plan on having education programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| And I think Carlton will tell you about some of the things we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| I have a position, a volunteer position, with five states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| And I travel around and visit gardens and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| And I will tell you that the first time I went out to East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| and saw the botanical gardens, I was blown away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| We have a jewel here in Knoxville, Tennessee that is unknown and unused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| And that is why a group seven, eight years ago decided this has got to be, we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| This is a main tourist attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| You do not realize the cities that I go to and see botanical gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| that have hundreds of thousands of people that come to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| And I'm not talking about New York City and San Diego.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| I'm talking about places like Norfolk, Virginia, Memphis, Tennessee, down in Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| I'm talking about places that are very similar to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| You have been very, very supportive of us in the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| And we're at a point now where we need that continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| We've asked for $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| This money will go towards helping to continue to clear the brush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| maintain these beautiful stone structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| If you've never been out there, and I know Sam's been because he came to our kite flying day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| we're really trying to incorporate that neighborhood and beautify that neighborhood too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| The executive directors that we have been interviewing have just come to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| they cannot believe what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| So I would greatly appreciate any support, continued support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| The $75,000 is crucial because, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| we are spending all the rest of our money to hire a director, a development director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| and all the groundskeepers that we have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| We have a great team of volunteers that are growing every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| and that is something that we will continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| The volunteers that we have, a lot of them are retired people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| It's a great outlet for our retirees and seniors in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| And then, like I said, it's a great thing for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| So we would appreciate the continued support of $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| Do you have any questions to ask of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Yes, ma'am. Does the city contribute anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Yes. The city is, we've asked the city for $150,000 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| Now, we don't know what we're going to get yet, but I think that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| after talking to Mayor Haslam, he is very supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| The Greenway system goes through the park, I mean, through the gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| and it's something that can become a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Also, it's connected to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| We are working with Green Magnet Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| We had a horticulturist that was working with that school on doing greenhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| and teaching those students all about botany, conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| I mean, it's just such an important issue now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| I'm familiar with it out there, but I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| I thought the city had already passed their budget, if they were given anything too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| They are, and I'm not sure. We asked for $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| I know we're not getting $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| You do know they are giving you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Yes. Mayor Haslam indicated to me when I asked him, you know, if we're in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| I believe we're in the budget for $75,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| That's out there in Commissioner Strickland's front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Yeah, that depressed neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| I know Mayor, former Mayor Victor Askey had $200,000 personal money at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| And have you seen the gardens that's been created? It's a show place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| It's a beautiful place. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| You need to go out there and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Depressed. Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| No, I was really going to, I didn't want to reemphasize what they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| but like Ivan just said, it really is a jewel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Take a Saturday or a Sunday and just walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| You would be amazed at the beauty that just surrounds you by that garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| It really is nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| But just don't come across the street, it's depressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Depressed over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3246)|

| 0:54:12| That would be because of you, Tank, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Evidently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| Well, maybe you need to get them to come over to your yard and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| I've been trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Boost it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| See, that's what we were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| We could cure the gardens and then stop by your house for a snack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Well, I thought you wanted to come over there and do some work first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| You'd have to sunshine that, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| PTA Clothing Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| Well, moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Teachers Supply Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Same person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| Pay Centers Outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3290)|
| 0:55:00| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| My name is Larry Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| I'm the Executive Director of Pay Centers Youth and Family Outreach, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| And I'm excited to finally get to this point after seven attempts, seven years in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| So it's exciting to be speaking with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Pay Centers is a community outreach ministry, but our primary focus is after school programs and summer day camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3316)|
| 0:55:27| We just finished our first year of a three- to five-year grant with the State Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| which I have to pause and say how excited I am about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| Most of the people that have received these funds are school districts and larger school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| We are among the first community-based grassroots organization to get approved for these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| It has done nothing but refined our process and teach us a lot about in-depth reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| We're excited to be serving about 40 to 50 kids a day every day in our after-school model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| We serve about 40 kids in our summer camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Our staff consists of educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| We hire Knox County school teachers to do our tutoring and our academic component, and we pay them very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| I was thinking on the way over here, we pay at least if not more than an extended contract pays educators for working after school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| and we are very pleased to be able to help supplement some of the income for some of these educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| We have some of the traditional components, recreation, and, of course, we have snack, which is the highlight of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| Which brings me to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Pay Centers' uniqueness is that we have been able to partner very well with other agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| namely the Second Harvest provided us with about 3,700 individual servings this year to serve our kids at no cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3405)|
| 0:56:55| and I think they're in your budget as well, and I appreciate you continuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| That helps the small grassroots organizations quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Our method of measure is we use report cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| We're waiting on the TCAP scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| We take in-progress reports from educators during the school year, which is a great advantage to be school-based as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| because we get to communicate with the child's educator and our instructors on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| We have quite a bit of parental involvement, because the Title I, these dollars that we're using require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| and I work with Title I with the District Advisory Council, too, and I know how important parent involvement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| I also have educated five in the process of educating five of my own children, so I know a lot about Knox County's system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| So I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| We had originally asked for, I think, $36,000 and some odd dollars, and we would appreciate any support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3465)|
| 0:57:53| Our contract with the state is reimbursement, and that's why these dollars are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| So our board of directors and myself went out and found the first set of dollars, what I call soft money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3480)|
| 0:58:07| But we certainly would use this, and this gives us a two- to five-year push, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| because this grant is renewable after the third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| So I would appreciate the county commission considering this funding for this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| And I'm a Baptist preacher, so I could go on and on, but I'm going to stop right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Commissioner Breed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Yes, what age children do you work with, and in which schools are you working with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| I currently work with first grade through sixth grade, and these dollars will also allow us to go into the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3513)|
| 0:58:43| So we'll be going up to seventh and eighth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| When I say sixth grade, I'm actually talking about fifth graders feeding into the sixth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| So now if we can get extra funding, we can catch our sixth and seventh grade students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| In which schools are you working with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| We're working in Syramore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| I just got elected as president of PTA of Green, so I know we're going to do something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| And we are going to be working at Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| And the Vine Middle School is in partnership with the Project GRAD model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| and some of those particular staff people were helping us implement this program after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you, Reverend Mathis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| We're going to back up and go to CAEDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3569)|
| 0:59:39| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I'm Diane Wright, and I'm the executive director of CAEDS, which stands for Concord Adult Day Enrichment Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| We are a licensed adult daycare in the Farragut West Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3588)|
| 0:59:55| and we serve senior adults who are still living in their home environments with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| Our adults have some kind of functioning need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| Usually the people who come to us have Alzheimer's disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| They're not ready for institutional care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Their families aren't ready for placing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| But what we do is provide a service that allows them to remain in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| They come to us during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| We enrich the quality of their lives by providing structured activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| giving them a reason to get up in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| We give them social contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| We have therapeutic activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And we give their families much-needed respite and time away so they can continue to care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| And I don't know if any of you have had the experience of dealing with aging loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| I've been doing this since the mid-'80s, and recently my mother came to live with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| And it's a whole different ballgame when it's your family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| That respite time is not a luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| It's a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Since we've been open since November 2005, we've served over 65 seniors and their families in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3670)|
| 1:01:20| We've had over 150 inquiries about our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3680)|
| 1:01:29| And these are people who are, there's nothing else in that area to serve these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| There are other adult daycares, but they would have to travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| and our families already are very, very overburdened and overstressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| We charge a fee for our service, but our fees cover about 60% to 65% of what our costs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3705)|
| 1:01:53| We are located at Concord United Methodist Church, who gives us free utilities and space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3713)|
| 1:02:02| and also contributes to our sustenance, I guess is a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| We're also very fortunate to receive memorials and donations and volunteer help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| We've already had about 4,500 hours of volunteers that have worked and have helped offset some salary costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3735)|
| 1:02:26| We're looking for help with scholarships in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| There are people, believe it or not, who live in the West Knoxville-Farragut area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| that can't afford our fees and meet financial criteria for scholarships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| So we need assistance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| These are taxpaying families, and their family members are living with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| We provide a wonderful service for the seniors in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3770)|
| 1:02:57| I just brought along a couple of comments that families have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| As caregivers, it has given us quality time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| It's also been a good benefit for a mother to get out of the house and be with other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| If they're home by themselves, they become isolated and depressed, and we give them that social contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| We are grateful for the support we as families receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| and for guidance to other resources in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| We're part of that continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| So when they get to a point where they're no longer appropriate for a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| we refer them to other area resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| A safe place for him to be with other people and do activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| A break for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Much-needed rest time to focus on my personal activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| Her memory and overall behavior is better when she attends Cades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| It's enabled us to enjoy some free time and to run errands and go to doctor's appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| It's pretty sad when your luxury has to do with taking care of your own personal care needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| when you can't do that when you have a loved one at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| And I can go on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| I'm not a preacher, but I do have a lot of letters here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| Your financial assistance will really help us to keep giving the care that we are giving to our seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| We would really love it if you could share the wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| and recognize this important service to the community and to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| There's no place like home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Please help us keep these seniors living at their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| and keep their family members with their support and the respite that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3884)|
| 1:04:53| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3896)|

| 1:05:40| and I'm also a member of the Volunteer Ministries Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| I come to speak to you about monies for Knoxville area project access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| which you have heard about and a pro forma is being passed around now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3952)|
| 1:06:00| About 60,000 people in Knox County, because of the changes in TennCare, are without health insurance this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3960)|
| 1:06:09| We've seen the budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| We know that's going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Low income and uninsured people have significant health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| and little or nothing to meet these health needs with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| Knoxville area project access is the organization that connects all of us, physicians, hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| and clinics in providing free care for these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| Over 800 physicians in all the area hospitals have agreed to participate in Kappa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| by donating their services free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Additionally, Kappa partners with primary health care facilities, Interfaith Health Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| Cherokee Health System, and a volunteer ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| It provides specialty and hospital services to those entities, all those entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| It has made those entities access to specialists good, whereas previously it was very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4023)|
| 1:07:12| To qualify for Kappa, an individual has to have a household income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, which, as you folks know, isn't very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4037)|
| 1:07:28| You have to be a resident of Knox County for a minimum of 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| and have no other access to health care from any other program whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| Patients begin with enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| They are then assigned to a case coordinator who works with them for the remainder of their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| while they are in Kappa, and we try to make that as short as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| Case managers work with the primary care home to provide any needed specialty care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| and hospital inpatient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Kappa physicians provide and submit all donated care costs back to Kappa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| so we can get an idea of how much money we would have spent if these patients had paid for this care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| at the lowest possible payment rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| To date, we've served approximately 9,200 patients at $4.78 million in documented care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4095)|
| 1:08:24| We estimate that to be much higher because, again, as you probably know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| health care payments generally run three months behind the provision of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| So we estimate it's more like $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| All health care services for patients are donated by Kappa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| No physician, no hospital, no clinic receives any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| All of the monies that we collect through grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| and those grants now are principally through a state of Tennessee grant and a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4133)|
| 1:09:04| well, I used to call it the red feather, but yes, grant, are used to administrate the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| We have 11 people working full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| We have a fine computer center, and I broke the bank of the Knoxville Academy Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4153)|
| 1:09:22| I spent their last $50,000, put them at no bank balance in order to buy that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| In July of 2007, Kappa received an expansion grant through United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| which is the major source of our funding right now, and we are now employing 12 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| Kappa is seeking further funding to extend these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| You have considered us for a $150,000 grant and, in your judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| have decided not to award us any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| The $150,000 which we're asking for will provide salaries for the people who administrate this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4197)|
| 1:10:04| and allow us to increase our services as we know we are going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4204)|
| 1:10:14| Let me close this way, and I'll present this to you the way I presented it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| to the Knoxville Academy of Medicine Foundation Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| I said, ladies and gentlemen, doctors, there are two reasons why we should do Kappa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| On the one hand, there's the altruistic, ethical, religious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| These people have nothing, and I suspect most of you go to churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| where your faith tells you you should help people who have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| That's one reason to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| The second reason to do this is cool, dispassionate, disinterested, and purely economic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| These people are going to be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Believe me, they will be treated some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| If we don't do it in the rational Knoxville Academy of Medicine Foundation Kappa manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4261)|
| 1:11:10| we will see them in our emergency rooms and in our operating rooms and in our clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| It will cost seven times as much to treat them there as it would have to treat them in Kappa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4277)|
| 1:11:26| We will all bear that cost one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| Police, 911, health agencies, your insurance premiums, drags on the state, we will fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4289)|
| 1:11:40| These people will be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Either one of these reasons for funding Kappa, it seems to me, are compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4302)|
| 1:11:53| I would very much like you, I and members of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| and Kappa Governing Board would very much like you to reconsider your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| I thank you very much for allowing me to speak to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| and I would be happy to answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| I have accompanying me Dr. Kim Weaver, who is the CEO of this project, who knows all of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4331)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| John, we haven't made a decision yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| This comes from the mayor's office recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| I realize it was a recommendation made to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| To what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| To you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| I stand in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| What do you suppose the amount of income that you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| and what do you think the ratio is for your costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| and then what you're able to disperse into the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| Our costs are administrative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| In the pro forma which you have in front of you is a complete outline of our costs, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| You have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| There is no income to any physician for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| They give their services free, all 800 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| There's no income to any hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| They give all this free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| I can tell you, folks, when Jack Lacey first proposed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| and he wanted to get all of the hospitals in one room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| the Knoxville Academy of Medicine and all the shakers and movers in medicine in one room in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| and propose this, I looked at him and I thought he had been smoking grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| I said, it'll never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| But it did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| You have all the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| As a matter of fact, all the hospitals not only agreed to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| and are not only providing this care free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| All these physicians are not only providing this care free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| The hospitals grub-staked us $35,000 a piece to get it up and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| And the academy let me break their bank with the last $50,000 to buy the computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| For reasons that are between the two polls that I just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| Some people do this because it's the right, the good, the ethical, the moral thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| Other people who really know how a health care system works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| can see how much money you're going to spend if you don't do it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| I don't know how much money goes back out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| I know how much we spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| And Commissioner DeFries, you have it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| I'll have to disclose first that I'll be the president next year of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| so there is some conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| But also, when we look at all these health agencies that we've looked at today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| that are providing care to the working uninsured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| we've already talked to the Interfaith Health Clinic and Dr. Kim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| and really Cherokee and the county health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| really everybody works together on this and everyone has a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| What CAPA does that we're talking right now is that they can refer patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| For instance, if a patient that goes to Interfaith Health Clinic needs a gallbladder operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| they can't provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| They can refer that through CAPA if they don't have their own surgeons to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| And it's the same thing with Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| It's the same with some of these others, the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Another point I'd like to make, and maybe, John, you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| there's probably 1,200 or so physicians in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| That's about right, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| About 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| We have, I think it was even back about the first of April, we had about 811 enrolled in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| And the reason that we don't have more is we just haven't gotten around to asking everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| But this is really, if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| this has been just a massive volunteer effort on the part of the physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| And as he mentioned, the doctors don't receive a penny of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| It's not like we're doing it at a discount rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| We don't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| But I think it was after TennCare disenrolled so many people, these people had nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| And this is where Interfaith Health Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| and that was really the motivation why CAPA was formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| is to do something to help take care of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| And I think the hospitals recognized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| Really, all the physicians in the community recognized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| And these people stepped forward, and that's why these programs are so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| I agree with everything that you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| The way we do this, we ask all the physicians, look, how many patients will you see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| We're not asking you to see 100, 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| We'll take any number you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| And if you've got 800 physicians each saying, well, I'll take six, I'll see four, I'll see five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| pretty soon you're doing pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| And that's exactly the way it has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Plus we have a computer system that allows us to coordinate all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I can tell you when TennCare disenrolled all those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| the county health people, the city health people, Knoxville Academy of Medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| they looked up and they saw a tsunami coming at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| They didn't know what in the world they would possibly do with all these patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| CAPA has literally been a lifesaver for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Commissioner Luthow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| My question is, is that the county has a contract with all the area hospitals for indigent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| so how is what you're doing with the different hospitals different from the contract that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| with them for the indigent care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I'm not aware of a contract that the county has for indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| What are the details of that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Well, we had a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| We just approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| It's a little over $5 million that helps pay for indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| If someone shows up at a hospital and they don't have any money, they're required, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| We have divided up amongst the different hospitals that $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| and that might be something you need to check into and see if you can maybe help do your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4676)|
| 1:18:04| and utilize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| I've been the chairman of a department at UT for 10 years before I stepped down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4687)|
| 1:18:16| I must say, I'm sorry, I'm not aware of these monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| I've invited Dr. Kim Weaver, who's the CEO of CAPA, and I'm sure she can answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| The indigent care program, they actually take care of patients that have an income at $500 or less each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| We pick up where indigent care takes, where they leave off, and we actually are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| we do up to 200% of the poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| So the people that we actually see, they don't have any other access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| These are people that don't qualify for TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| They don't qualify for the indigent care program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| They're people that are just left out in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| And if I can answer a question that Commissioner DeFreeze asked a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| Last year we had a budget of about $500,000, a little over $500,000 and some change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| and we actually administered an estimated $7 million in care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| So we're actually, if you look at our return on the investment, it's pretty great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| Yes, that's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| That's what I was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Kim, while you're still up there, I just wanted to make the point is that the county also has a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| I think, with Cherokee and some of these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| And to answer Commissioner Leuthold's question, and be sure I have this straight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| that's why I wanted you to stay up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| is that that's for people who are truly the lower level indigent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| and what CAPA is picking up are those people that fall in between those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| CAPA is that next sort of level up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| It's like we always say, you know, the poorest of the poor get taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| It's these people that don't have a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| or don't have an income where they have enough to buy health insurance on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| These are the people that previously were on TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| Because the TennCare program still exists, but it's just for sort of the poorest of the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| These are the people that were disenrolled from TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| And as I've been sitting here today, and I know we're getting to a longer discussion, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| but, you know, this is about the third or fourth group that's out there helping the uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4807)|
| 1:20:16| And I don't know if there's a way to maybe coordinate this a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| so we don't have four or five groups out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| I mean, they're all doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| I'm just wondering if they pull the resources, if we could maybe do it better even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| That's not to take away from any group, because I think they're all doing the best they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I'll answer part of that, and Kim can, too, because we're both very much intimately involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| I think the answer to that question, that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| It is being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| And I don't know if you noticed after we finished, I went back and talked to Melissa, I talked to Dr. Kim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| and we have meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| We had one out of Park West Hospital, what was it, a couple of weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Just a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| And we meet regularly on what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| There really isn't an overlap of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| It's not everyone working and pulling on the same rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| But in certain ways, everyone has a slightly different role in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| and there is a tremendous amount of coordination between all the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| And Melissa knows what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| We know what she does within her faith, and it's the same thing with Dr. Kim in Cherokee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| and Mark Jones at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| As Commissioner Dan has just said, if we were able to maybe eliminate some of the administrative costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| associated with each one, you know, maybe the money goes a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| And I understand that they've each got their own little, not little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| but their own sort of specialty or their own sort of sector of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| And, you know, maybe you've got certain groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| You've got the lowest of the low covered by the indigent care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| and then maybe the next step up and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| It just seems like they're all very worthy and I'd like to help them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| And I'm just wondering if there's just a way to better coordinate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| and if you are working on that with them, then I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| We do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope you will reconsider our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| Or consider it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Even though your sheet shows three people, we have ten more to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| After the list was distributed to you, six more people called, plus public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| Mental Health Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| My name is Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| I'm the executive director of the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| We are located at 9050 Executive Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| That's in Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| Commissioner Pinkston, earlier this morning you asked folks to identify their total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| Our total budget is $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| And of the $300,000, about a third or $100,000 would be from various grant sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| Those would be state, local, federal, as well as foundations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| Now, the amount of funds we requested of Knox County was $15,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=4995)|
| 1:23:23| of which about $12,180, I think, was recommended by the allocation panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| That would represent about 4% of our total budget if it were indeed awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| Now, when we talk about mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| what you need to understand is about one in four people has a mental illness in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| That means if there's still about 40 people in this room today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| about 10 people in the room need mental health care today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| Also needs about 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| Don't go pointing at each other now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| You all noticed he did look at commission when he said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| No, I have to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| These folks in the back know I'm talking about them too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| But also that means about 50% or more will need mental health care in their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| So it's really important that everyone understand that mental illness really does not discriminate against anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| based on their age, their gender, their race, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| Now, what we had proposed for a grant proposal was to help us fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| and really expand a program we are doing in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| and many, many other schools all across East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| Our proposal is for something called Mental Health 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| Mental Health 101 was started in 2000 at three Knox County high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| And as you can imagine, as incidents have occurred at Virginia Tech and Campbell County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5095)|
| 1:25:03| and places like that where there's been some serious episodes of school violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| other schools start to pay attention and they start to say we want your program too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| So I can tell you the program has grown significantly with Knox County Commission support over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| but also with some other funding support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| We're now in 53 schools in 22 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Now, the reason we asked for money from Knox County is we're only in 12 schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| We're in 10, excuse me, nine Knox County high schools, one Knox County middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| and two private schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| However, there are a few high schools that we need to expand to with the appropriate resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| There's also a tremendous opportunity to expand to middle schools in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| with the partnership of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| And that's what I'm really here to tell you about is a fantastic opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| Now, why is Mental Health 101 so important to kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| Fifty percent of people who develop a mental illness will have their symptoms start by age 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| Seventy-five percent of people who develop a mental illness will have their symptoms start by age 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| Now, the worst statistic is the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| Most people average 10 to 12 years or more from start of symptoms to start of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| That means they suffer, often horribly, and will likely end up with crippling psychiatric disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5191)|
| 1:26:40| We can prevent all this if we intervene a whole lot earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| That's what Mental Health 101 is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| It's about early intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| If you get to the person as the symptoms onset early, we can help them identify what those symptoms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| Then we can turn that into a situation where they are not attempting to harm themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| or somebody else or, worse, complete that suicide attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| So it's really important that you understand what we're doing in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| I mentioned we're in 12 schools in Knox County, public and private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| There is some piece of data called the YRBS, which stands for Youth Risk Behavior Survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| It's administered at three grade levels across the state, including Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| 7th grade, 9th grade, and 11th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| The data is not pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| What it shows you is nine kids in every classroom in Knox County high schools are suffering from depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5257)|
| 1:27:48| Five children in every classroom have contemplated suicide, and four have attempted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| So this is the whole basis for our starting this program years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| We knocked on the door trying to get in for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| and then finally we were able to get in in 2000, and it's just taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| We are now able to tell you that in the time that we've started the program and run it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| suicides in Knox County and Blount County, those are the two school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| two counties where we have the most schools, have fallen by 85%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| That is significant, but at the same time you need to understand there are still about 350 to 450 admissions annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| to Knox County MedSurg Hospital emergency rooms where there's been an injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| A child has cut themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Maybe they've used a different weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Maybe they've taken some medications, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| So the need is significant to continue the program and grow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| especially to get to those schools where we are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| Now, I'll tell you about the partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Knox County Schools has come to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| We want the same success you're having with older teens to happen in middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| So they have devoted some staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| They've worked with us to review the high school age curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| which is for an hour and a half in the wellness classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| and look at how do we adapt it to middle school learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| Those kids are younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| They're 13, 14, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| So they've helped us provide that assistance to convert the program to middle school learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| They are ready to help us roll it out with, of course, the funding support of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| So we want to thank you for supporting the allocation panel's recommendation to allocate those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| and really want to thank you for investing in the mental health of our young residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Ben, a quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I want to get a clarification on a statistic you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Did you say that four kids in every classroom in Knox County have attempted suicide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| That's what the data suggests, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| The YRBS data is collected through the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| It is a voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| Now, is that high school or middle school or every?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| High school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| High school, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| High school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| The middle school data for the last time it was administered is not available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| but typically over the years the middle school data has been worse than the high school data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| So it posed an interesting dilemma for us as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| Why are we putting the program in high schools when we really should be in middle schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| The answer to that is really the high schools came to us and said we want your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| The middle schools didn't want the program early in this decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| The middle schools have since changed their mind and want the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| Thank you, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| Appreciate it, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| Now, you had said that the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| are they contributing dollars to this program as well in their budget or are you just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| It will be more of an in-kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| Two things have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| One, the in-kind has been they have assigned some staff to help change the high school-based curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| and activities towards middle school learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| So they pulled folks out to work with our staff for a couple of days to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| The second thing is probably more significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| They are willing to provide some in-kind resources to help with materials for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| Each child in the classroom when we're there gets materials for not only the day they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| but then their subsequent learning activities that we have trained the middle school teachers to employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| So that's what the school system's contribution will be at this point, some of those material costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| which is going to save us because we did not have 100 percent funding recommendation from the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Sir Thomas Sinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5513)|
| 1:32:02| Hello. I'm Becky Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| I'm Executive Director at Sir Thomas Sinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| and I want to thank you for the opportunity to come here today to discuss a little bit about our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| For those of you that don't know, Sir Thomas Sinner serves about 110 adults with a primary diagnosis of mental retardation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| There's all the fancier words, but that kind of explains it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| The individuals we serve are once the school system finishes serving them at 22, we can take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| But what is happening because of a lot of funding at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| there's not a lot of new individuals that are receiving funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| and so the individuals we serve are more aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| But we offer vocational life skills and residential services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| But the individuals we serve are a very targeted population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| It's not like some of the other organizations that they see people a few times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| and they kind of rotate through the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Once an individual comes to Sir Thomas Sinner, they pretty much will be with us for life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| In fact, we had a gentleman that passed away yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| He had actually moved into a nursing home, and I had left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| Some of my staff were going to the funeral home to plan his funeral today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| even though he still wasn't receiving services from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| But that's kind of a lot of things we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| Many of the individuals in our residential program either have no families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| or they're from very indigent families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| So we really are their total life supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| Our request for funding and support from Knox County is to fund a health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| and wellness program for the individuals we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| Actually, we had applied under the social service category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| but because it was a health and wellness component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| I think we got shifted to the medical component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| So we're kind of borderline, I guess, between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| With the advances in medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| with individuals living more in community settings instead of institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| and with better quality of care, the life expectancy of these individuals is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| Back when Sir Thomas Sinner was started back in 1961, the life expectancy was about 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| Now it's reaching up around 65 or 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5648)|
| 1:34:13| So what we're seeing is as they're aging, you've got all the aging health issues that arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| plus some of their inerrant physical disabilities that we're dealing with, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| And, you know, our individuals require nursing assistance with many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| that most of us would manage on a day-to-day basis ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| such as taking medicines, monitoring blood sugar, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| Their health needs are sometimes more complicated, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| in including emergency, acute, and chronic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| Some of these are we have many clients that have chronic lung disease, diabetes, ileostomies, cancer, seizures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5686)|
| 1:34:54| or blood pressure problems, just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| But 47% of all the people we serve at Sir Thomas are over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| And that's a staggering figure when it comes into, you know, our realm of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| And, you know, we were requesting funding to help staff in our clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| which oversees the health medicines and medical appointments for these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| and help provide supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Just to give you a scope of what our clinic does, our individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| because many of them are on a lot of multiple medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| take somewhere between 25,000 to 30,000 pills a month collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| That's a huge amount, and that's just our residential individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| That doesn't include our day-only clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| And our clinic staff has to transport and monitor about 80 doctor's visits a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| So it's pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| We also had requested funds to help fund a wellness program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and working in partnership with the YMCA, the Kansler Y, that's right across the street from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| And what's happened is a lot of the individuals, because they're on psychotropic meds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| they're more prone to obesity, even though our society is more prone to obesity, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| But they, if we can help work with their physical fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5772)|
| 1:36:18| we can maybe waylay some of these medicines and some of the issues that arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| And the Y works with us with doing an indigent membership type thing, and we do classes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| But about 85% of our individuals we serve are below the poverty level here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| because of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| This is a really critical year for us to receive funding from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| I know everybody knows what the funding level has been at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| but we experienced a huge payment reduction from the state back late December for the first part of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5807)|
| 1:36:56| And they actually did not pay us about $100,000 of what we were supposed to be paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| we were contracted to be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| They have pretty much promised us that we will see continued reductions or additional reductions next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| As a result, we've had to make a lot of hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| We had to close one of our homes, the one over by the Wii golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| and we hated to give up that location because we'd been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| And they enjoyed watching the golfers come through their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| And we've had to cut back some of them on our staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| Our staffing, we don't have a lot of luxury there because these are direct support staff that are in the homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| that are helping our individuals bathe and help them with their eating and just a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| So it's really hard to cut back staff, but we've had to do some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| If we do not receive this funding, we will have to make some additional decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| and some hard decisions and possibly make some more cuts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| And the bad thing is this comes at a time when we need to be building our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| because there's over 600 people on the waiting list in Knox County needing services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| and I get calls from families all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| So we really need to be building instead of pulling back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| So I know this is a tough decision for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| I know you've heard of a lot of critical needs here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| but I really would appreciate your consideration in making a difference in the life of the individuals at Sertoma Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| You will be remembered by how you help the members of our community who cannot help themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| some of our most vulnerable citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Becky, I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| What is your overall budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| It's just a little over $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| And 80% of that is for staffing issues, I mean the direct support staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| How much do you all do in special events that you all raise yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5927)|
| 1:38:54| In our center budget, about $100,000 that goes to supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Legal aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5944)|
| 1:39:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| I'm Deborah House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| I'm the Associate Director with Legal Aid of East Tennessee here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| Legal Aid is a nonprofit law firm that provides free legal help to low-income people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| to senior citizens, to victims of domestic violence, and to low-income community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| Our program actually is fairly large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| We cover a 26-county service area from Johnson City down to Chattanooga with seven offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| Our main office is here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| and the project that we are proposing to the county is going to be run out of the Knox County office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| and serves Knox County senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| While we are a law firm that does provide free legal help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| we have a whole range of different services and serve a number of different populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| We have attorneys on staff who provide direct legal representation to clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| We have paralegals who can advocate in administrative forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| and also do an extensive amount of advice and brief service on the direct supervision of an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| We also have a pretty extensive support staff to support the work of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| Last year we assisted almost 10,000 low-income individuals, seniors, and victims of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| Our program that we are proposing is what we're calling a Senior Outreach Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| and it is a collaborative effort between Legal Aid of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| and others in the senior service community here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| Right now Legal Aid is the only provider of free legal assistance to low-income seniors in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| We receive funding through the Area Agency on Aging and Disability to support those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| However, that funding is very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| We receive approximately $30,000 or so a year to provide a limited scope of legal services to seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| That contract we have with the Area Agency on Aging and Disability allows us to provide services for two hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6060)|
| 1:41:07| to a set number of individuals, and I think the number of individuals is close to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| We're limited to two hours of service under that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| Obviously, you can't do much in the legal realm with two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| Fortunately, that program, our senior citizens component, ties in with the rest of our legal assistance program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| and we do have other resources available to provide extended representation to our senior citizen population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| which is not the panacea or the solve-all for the problem that we are here to address today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| Legal Aid is in a position where we must be reactive to problems that people already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| We do not have the luxury of being proactive, getting to people on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| and providing information that they may need before they get into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| The senior outreach program that we have proposed to the county would allow us to be proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| It would enable our very experienced senior citizens attorney on staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| who has more than 24 years of experience with our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| to do an additional amount of outreach into our senior citizens community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| to educate them on the front end about legal issues that they may be facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| so they can take action now to avoid problems on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| Because the reality is, if they've already gotten in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6139)|
| 1:42:22| and I'll give you a couple of examples in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| it's very hard for them to dig out, particularly our senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| who are some of our most vulnerable residents here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| Several current issues that come to mind, with which you are all probably very familiar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| the one first and foremost on most people's minds right now is the mortgage foreclosure crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| While we have limited resources and ability to represent folks who are involved in foreclosures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| we feel that if people had adequate information on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| about issues they may be facing and things to avoid before they get into trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| that would alleviate the necessity for them coming to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| or somebody else on the back end to try and dig out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| And as we know, the loss of a home can be one of the most tragic losses for any individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| particularly our senior citizens who have worked all their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| and have most everything they have invested into their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| And with what's going on right now in the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| we are also seeing more and more issues that our seniors are facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| that are very ripe and amenable to proactive intervention on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| as opposed to waiting until they're in trouble and trying to get out on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| And I keep emphasizing that proactive piece of it because in our work at Legal Aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| it is rather unique to be proposing something that is proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| And that's a very sad commentary on our legal system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| and on the status of poor folks and victims of domestic violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| and senior citizens in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Another example that we talk about in the senior realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| just a moment, let me flip my page and look at my notes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6232)|
| 1:44:02| would be elder abuse and exploitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Yes, sir? One minute? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| This is a large problem with senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| where people are taking advantage of our seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| family members, caregivers, other relatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| and they're being physically abused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| they're being exploited financially and otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| With adequate information on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| again, they can often prevent problems on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| So we are proposing a project where our attorney would be out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| collaborating with our current senior citizens' providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| to determine what legal problems are most relevant to our senior citizen population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| devising outreach and education materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| and being in the community presenting seminars and educational programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| to seniors where they live and where they are on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| I just wanted to ask if the University of Tennessee, the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| partners with your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| We partner extensively with the UT Legal Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| particularly in the areas of domestic violence and landlord-tenant law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| We have a couple of different collaborative projects with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| We also have their students in our office interning and clerking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| We're not currently in any collaborations on the senior citizens' issue at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| We've heard a lot today about the doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| and how the doctors are 800 strong that are developing or giving of their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| What about the lawyers in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| Have you worked a collaboration with the lawyers about them giving of their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| giving X number of hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| We have an established pro bono project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| We have a full-time pro bono coordinator on our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| Attorney Terry Woods, and it is her sole job to collaborate with lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| in the Knoxville Bar Association to donate their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| We estimate that approximately 800 lawyers in the Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| currently donate their services on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| and that number is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| In fact, just two weeks ago we had a pro bono celebration here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| where we recognized many, many individual lawyers and law firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| in the Knoxville community that donate their time and their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| The American Bar Association has a 50-hour-a-year aspirational goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| for attorneys to donate their time to legal services and free legal help to the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| Our Tennessee Bar Association is currently considering a similar aspirational goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| Currently pro bono is not a required activity in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| although it is in some other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| and that's something that we're working on a statewide basis to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| and to coordinate those kind of pro bono activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| We have Thomas Dean, One Love Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6404)|

| 1:46:57| What do you see, Dean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| One Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6419)|

| 1:47:10| Mike Langley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Barbara Renathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| The Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| My name is Mike Langley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| I'm Secretary and Treasurer of the Barbara Renathy Memorial Park Incorporated Community and Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6447)|
| 1:47:35| And I, too, would like to thank you all for the invitation to come down and speak to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6455)|
| 1:47:42| I also would like to thank you for the help that you've given us in the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| It's been very beneficial to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| The mascot seniors or the Barbara Renathy House property was first listed by Knox County in 1906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6469)|
| 1:47:59| In the early 70s, the property and house had been abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| The yard had not been cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| There were junk cars on the property, and the house was in need of repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| In April of 1973, members of the mascot United Methodist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| and other members of the community went together and bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| In April, they cleaned the property up, renovated it, did the best they could with the house, which lasted for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6501)|
| 1:48:31| The property was later donated to the mascot community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| After the property was donated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| volunteers of the community worked very hard again to restore what needed to be done for the community and the seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| and was used by many different organizations in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| In 2003, we had saved enough money over five or six years to put a roof on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6531)|
| 1:48:59| In 2006 and 2007, with the help of Knox County grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| we were able to refurbish the downstairs with the help of the people of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| We also bought the paint, and the people did the painting inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| We work on volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| We don't want the money just to do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| We want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| In 2007, 2008, we were able to get another grant, which we were able to put siding, plumbing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| electrical work, and a picnic shed out beside the Barbara Abernathy house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6567)|
| 1:49:35| We again bought the paint, and the people in the community painted the upstairs and worked with it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| This was what was most impressive to the people from Knox County and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| and even the commissioners that came out and saw it, is the volunteer people of the community that were coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| and wanting to do the help that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| We have 30 to 35 people at our senior meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| And with the help of John T. O'Connor Center in St. Mary's, we have some wonderful programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| which are very important to the seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| We have needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Our picnic shed is a beautiful shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| We have no tables, no benches, no anything for it at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| We have inside our tables that we use inside are old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| and we're in the process of trying to figure out how to get us some new tables and chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6625)|
| 1:50:31| because with seniors that can be a real problem sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| Our tables have big cut places out in them and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| We pay our own utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| We do our own maintenance work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| It's all volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| And we take care of the grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| Our income, the only income that we have is from donations and from different pancakes, biscuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| gravy, breakfasts, chili, hot dogs, hamburger suppers, and rent for anniversaries, family reunions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6656)|
| 1:51:04| weddings and receptions, birthday parties, Thanksgiving and Christmas parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| We have no salary personnel on the Barbara Abernathy House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6669)|
| 1:51:17| It's all community volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Again, I'd like to thank everyone here for what they've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| We agreed when we started into this and talked to the commissioners and talked to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| that we would try to do this over a four-stage period, and we have completed two stages of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| And we still have two more to go, and then we will probably walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| You won't hear a whole lot from us unless some catastrophe happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| but I certainly want to thank you for what you've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| It's really been beneficial to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Boys and Girls Club, Lisa Hurst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6715)|
| 1:52:05| I, too, want to thank you all for giving us the opportunity to come and talk about our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| and answer any questions that you all might have about our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| When we look at the Boys and Girls Clubs and the program that we're asking for funding for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| it's goals for graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| And I'm just curious from you all, how many of you all had someone that you asked for help with your homework?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| Did anybody need any help with their homework?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| Nobody needed help with their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| Hell, we had quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| When you think about who helped you with your homework, or maybe who you helped with your homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6753)|
| 1:52:38| it could have been a sibling, an older sibling, mom, dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Somebody was around that helped you be successful in school and helped to lead and guide you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6761)|
| 1:52:48| Boys and Girls Clubs, the goals for graduation program, will serve 3,000 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| It's some of the most at-risk children in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| And just wanted to tell you a little bit about the children that we're asking for funding for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| The children are ages 5 to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| Fifty-four percent of those youth are male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| Forty-six are female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| Thirty-nine percent are African American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| Fifty-seven percent Caucasian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| One percent Hispanic and three percent other cultures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| But the real thing about our children is for you all to know that Boys and Girls Club seeks out to be in places where nobody else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6798)|
| 1:53:27| Boys and Girls Club wants to make sure that the most at-risk children in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| have an equalizer to help them be just as successful as any other child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Fifty-eight percent of our children that come to the Boys and Girls Club come from low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Seventy-eight percent of those children are from single-parent homes or living in foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| Our kids need the extra help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Just to give you a little premise of what the goals for graduation is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| it offers homework, help, and assistance for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Also, during homework, help, and assistance, there's lots of times that we identify special areas of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6838)|
| 1:54:04| where the kids need additional tutorial services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| We're able to have teachers, other volunteers, staff actually help the kids with their homework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| develop academic support plans so that they can be successful in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| In addition to that, we make sure that our kids understand goal setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| Also, make sure that we have career awareness and preparation programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| recognition and incentives, and also try to get the parents very involved with our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| The funds that we requested, we asked originally for $47,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6873)|
| 1:54:38| The Citizens Review Committee recommended that we receive $31,725,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6878)|
| 1:54:45| which is absolutely phenomenal, and we really appreciate all and anything that we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| Just to make sure that you all clearly understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| every penny that we receive from Knox County goes directly to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| We have to have those resources to be able to help our kids be successful in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| Our kids don't have resources at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| They don't have the parent that can afford to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| and help them get all the supplies they need for a science fair project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Our children do just as well in the science fair as any other child in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| because of the support of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Also, our children have access to computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6918)|

| 1:55:25| Our families have access to computers because of where we're strategically located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Also, the learning aids and tools that all of us have bought for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| to help them to learn and be successful, our kids expect to have that at the Boys and Girls Clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| If they didn't have those resources at the Boys and Girls Clubs, it wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| As you're looking at how you're going to distribute the funds throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| I hope that you consider the recommendations of the Citizens Review Panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| See the value of investing in our children and making sure that they're successful in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| as well as making sure that anything that is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| that the organizations that you understand that we are transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| and we'll offer you any support that you need to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| that the dollars that we receive are spent exactly the way we said that they're going to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| No questions. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| Children's Dance Ensemble, Judy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Hi, I'm Judy Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=6986)|
| 1:56:41| I'm the Managing Director of the Tennessee Children's Dance Ensemble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| This is Amy Wilson, one of our artistic directors of the dance ensemble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| We were founded in 1982, and you've seen me up here a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| The dance ensemble still holds the distinction of being the only professional modern dance company in the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7017)|
| 1:57:06| composed entirely of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| When we perform, not only do people see excellence in an art form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| children get to experience their own peers achieving excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| The money that we've requested goes to bring our local school children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| in to see our premier performances every year here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| Those performances have gotten more and more and more expensive all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| And as I talk, I'm going to ask Amy if she won't distribute to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| a magazine that we publish every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| It gives you pictures of our dancers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| It tells you about our children and where they come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| and gives you some idea of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| Truly, the Tennessee Children's Dance Ensemble has put Knoxville on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| We are listed in everywhere you Google children's dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| it comes up Tennessee Children's Dance Ensemble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| We're the only company made up of children to ever be listed in Dance USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| which is a peer group made up of professional dance companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| When we perform every year when we open our season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| not only do these young people that we bring in see dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| they hear other children talking about the importance of time management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| the importance of committing to something that you love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| the importance of being drug-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| We bring children in, oftentimes, to see their first dance concert ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7126)|
| 1:58:54| Sometimes we bring them in, they've never even seen the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7134)|
| 1:58:59| You all know the economic situation we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| and I know your job is not an easy one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| But we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| It's gotten more and more expensive to do what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| and we fund our community enrichment program with an annual benefit auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| We have more than 700 merchants, artists, and craftspeople who give us items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7158)|
| 1:59:25| We auction those off, and that money goes to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| But it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| We're finding more and more that children can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| We're having to subsidize more and more of the ticket money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| There is subsidy money available from the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| but it's quickly used up early in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| Our concert's always in March, that second semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| and we struggle to get our share of that money, and we don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| Your funding is crucial in seeing that this program continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| We appreciate you more than you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| We want to be utilized by you in your programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| We want to continue to show children that with the proper training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| the proper commitment on their part, that they can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| I might add that teachers are extremely motivated also when they see this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7221)|
| 2:00:30| because they know that if their kids can do this on that stage in dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| they can do it in other areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| I'd welcome any questions from you, anything I can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| I would like to say we've operated in the black since the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| We use Post-it notes that don't stick because they got donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| We don't waste a nickel, but we really, really need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| We want to be utilized by you, and we need this project funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| and I stand here to answer any questions I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| Ma'am, how much does it cost a child to belong to the dance ensemble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| It doesn't cost a child anything to belong to the dance ensemble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| Each parent is obligated to raise money in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7280)|
| 2:01:27| Our idea is that every child has their own network of people that they know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7287)|
| 2:01:35| and our goal is to have the parent not have to pay anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| but have that child go into the community and contact their friends and contact businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| because that way people know about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| And if they can't say something good about us, we're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| All of their company classes are paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| When we do international touring, which I'm sure you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| we've toured extensively nationally and internationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| There is no charge for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| They buy their leotards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| In many cases, we subsidize entirely because we do have some situations of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| whose parents can't go into the community because there's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| They have no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| And nobody even knows who those children are on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| But where we need to, we subsidize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| Where parents can help us, of course, we solicit their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| But there is no charge as such for anything that's company related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| The dancers do take classes in addition to company classes, and they pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7354)|
| 2:02:40| But here again, a lot of that gets subsidized also, but not through this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7360)|
| 2:02:49| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| I have one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| How many members in the ensemble are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| There are 24 dancers at any one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| And every once in a while, you'll see we only have 18 or we have 25 because it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| They actually are in the ensemble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| We start looking at them for membership when they're 9 years old or 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| and then they age out when they age out of high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| So we used to say that they were in there through 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| and we realized we were losing our best dancers every year because we train them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| and then all of a sudden they're 16 and they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| So we changed that about 10 years ago, and now they're in there through high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7412)|
| 2:03:38| And we say 24 dancers average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Everything we do is done with excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Every piece of material we put out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| we take seriously that we represent the state of Tennessee, our city, our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| We take that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| Nobody makes an impression like the Stance Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| I mean, they look like they've been licked clean when they get off that bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| There's no sloppy kids with T-shirts hanging out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| I mean, we're pretty strict, but it makes a good impression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| and I think you can be proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| I hope you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| Thank you, Ms. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| Who was your lead teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| Irena Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| You know, we lost Dr. Floyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| I was at her memorial service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| And Irena Lynn is now the artistic director of the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| and she's doing a great job with Amy, our associate artistic director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| Amy's still with you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| Yeah, Amy's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| And an awesome choreographer, a real talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| We're lucky to have her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Knoxville is blessed to have these talented artists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| Epilepsy Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| I want to thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak to you this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| about the Epilepsy Foundation of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| My name is Roy Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| I'm the president of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| We have our office at 1715 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| We submitted for two different grants, one for $4,000 for public education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7532)|
| 2:05:38| and the other for $4,000 for client assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| I'm going to take this from a little different perspective than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| I'm going to take this from the eyes of a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| I have no vested interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| I secure no salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| And I want to try, before I leave this podium today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| I want to try and have this group of people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| or have a little better grasp of epilepsy as a disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7564)|
| 2:06:11| I think, and as I said in our public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| there has been such a huge stigma through the years that many people will not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7577)|
| 2:06:22| even to this day, admit to the fact that they suffer with epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| Let me take it one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| We have no cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| There is no silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| They have a host of medications that are oftentimes helpful in suppressing seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7594)|
| 2:06:41| There's a utilization of brain surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| and there's also a vagus nerve stimulator, which has become rather successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| although, again, not with a silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| So part of our mission in education, public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7613)|
| 2:06:57| and let me just say we have met with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| We will be training all of the sheriff's employees starting in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| It will take us 14 weeks to educate all of their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| We're doing their academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| We're presently doing Knoxville PD Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| We've educated all of the CAT bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| When you say what is important about education with epilepsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| I would dare to say that 95% of the commissions sitting up there today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7645)|
| 2:07:31| if I went into a grand mal seizure today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| they would not be fully prepared with the exception of possibly Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| It is so misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| It's the most misunderstood disorder on the planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| And so education, and I might add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| we go into all the schools in wellness, daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| All of our staff are DHS certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| We have four full-time staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| Let's get into the assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| We do a host of caveats of ways that we assist people with epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7685)|
| 2:08:12| We help them in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| We help them with medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| When Tancre made their major developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| I heard someone earlier speaking about clients taking a host of different medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| Many times it takes two, maybe three different kinds of medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| And let me remind you that all that has to do with mental is extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7712)|
| 2:08:41| So needless to say, prescriptions for epileptic seizure medication is extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7721)|
| 2:08:48| We also assist in transportation to Vanderbilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| And let me make you aware of the fact that the national average is 1.6 in every 100 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7732)|
| 2:09:01| We're talking about a national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| In East Tennessee, the average is 2.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| We are one point over what the national average is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| and the scientific community does not understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| So obviously I hope that you can see the need because there is a huge demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| Let's also speak to the fact that I could be standing here today non-epileptic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7764)|
| 2:09:31| Tomorrow I could be epileptic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| There are many, many different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| We just put out 650 helmets last week for kids on skateboards and on bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7776)|
| 2:09:45| Blunt trauma to the head is one of the leading causes of epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| How do I know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| I had a nephew at age eight who had a bicycle accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| and was left being epileptic and was on phenobarbital as a medication to suppress his seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7795)|
| 2:10:04| So what we have here is we have a misunderstanding from the general public at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7804)|
| 2:10:12| due to the fact that if they don't have a family member, a friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| or a loved one who actually lives with epilepsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| they probably, because of not encountering it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| have absolutely no clue what a person with this disorder goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| And I might add job discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| There are a host of things that are besieged with people who live with epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| So again, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| We appreciate the county's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| They've been there for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| The monies that we've earmarked, our budget is extremely conservative, as anyone can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7846)|
| 2:10:57| And I can also say that anyone that would be willing or wanting to come to any board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| we have complete transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| All you have to do is call our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| We'd be more than happy to have you sit in one of our board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| So again, I want to thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| I hope that I'm walking away with maybe instilling some thought in your mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| that maybe you would understand epilepsy as it stands today in a little different view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| So thank you very much, and I'd answer any and all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| And by the way, I will just note there are roughly 42,000 people in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| And in Knox County, which is our largest county, we serve 24 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| There are approximately 15,862 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| And obviously, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| the stigma precludes the fact from people stepping out and saying they have epilepsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| So those numbers probably are not exactly accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| Again, I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| Mr. Cruz, I just wanted to ask you very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| do you know the population of school-age children that have epilepsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| and how many of those are mainstreamed in our classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| Again, our numbers are predicated on CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7934)|
| 2:12:21| We don't take it in a specific age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| We take it as a ratio of what the national average is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| So that's where we base our formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| I can tell you that we come in contact with, I think last year somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| around 13,000 in our education, and that's not in health fairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| But like I say, anybody that knows us, if they'll just reach out to us, we'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| That's what we're about is seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| I probably haven't answered your question exactly the way you'd like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| but I'm not going to say something that I don't have facts in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| Again, Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| How's everyone feeling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7992)|
| 2:13:13| Do you all need a break after this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| We have at least an hour to go after Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| Let's take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8001)|
| 2:13:22| Go ahead, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| Thank you very much, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| My name is Ken Knight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| I'm here as this year's President of the Dogwood Arts Festival Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| and appreciate all that you've done for the Dogwood Arts Festival in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| This year we just wrapped up our 48th annual event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| making us Knoxville's oldest and easily most prestigious festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| And we've really got three basic missions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| and I thought I'd share with you what those were today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| and tell you a little bit about some of the things that we do to help us accomplish those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| Number one is we want to help fund arts education in our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8030)|
| 2:13:54| And probably the three biggest things we do for that are we have a student art exhibit each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| which this year was at Farragut Town Hall and in the Phoenix Building downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| in which we award cash prizes to area high school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| At our annual house and garden show every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| probably our most successful event this year at that item was we had park benches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| which were painted and decorated by area high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8059)|
| 2:14:22| We then auctioned those off and donated those monies back to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| And then each year we hold a teacher exhibition in which we, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| give local Knox County teachers cash and gift certificates to be used back in their classrooms on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8070)|
| 2:14:38| Our second mission, and probably the one we're most famous for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| is to promote the visual and performing arts in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| We do many things to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Number one is Art in Public Places, which is still going right now through the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| You've probably seen it in Crouch Park and the Crouch Park Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8092)|
| 2:14:56| We hold a jazz concert in partnership with the Knox County Jazz Orchestra every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| We have a limited edition print contest, which two years ago we went from having it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| I guess, basically juried by folks within the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| It's now done by public vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| Our most famous winner to date is Mike Berry, who won the 2007 contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| You've probably seen much of his other work on billboards for Pilot Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| so obviously that's worked well for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| We have a fine arts show every year that features art, photography, sculpture from around the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8122)|
| 2:15:29| We also have our festival on Market Square, which this year we estimated that over 25,000 people attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8129)|
| 2:15:38| An interesting thing that I experienced this year was in talking to many of the merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8138)|
| 2:15:42| I can tell you of three of the restaurants who this Saturday of this year's Market Square festivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8142)|
| 2:15:47| had their highest revenue days in the history of their establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| We were excited about that and had a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| Lastly, we want to preserve and maintain the natural beauty of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| Probably the two best-known things we do there are, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| we help maintain over 70 miles of dogwood trails in all parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| Something that we're working on right now is in 2010 we'll have our 50th anniversary celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| and we're working on plants to plant thousands of dogwood trees throughout the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| That's a brief synopsis of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Again, appreciate all that you've done for us in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8179)|
| 2:16:26| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| You didn't like that look, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| Ken, first of all, I'd like to thank you and commend you for all you do for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8192)|
| 2:16:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| You're a tireless public servant and I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| Ken, I got to attend the grand opening this year of the Dogwood Arts Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8203)|
| 2:16:50| and I thought that was just a wonderful gala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| But I wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| 15 years ago I felt like that the Dogwood Arts Festival was the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| I felt like over the last few years that it's done kind of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| It's slipped off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| You and I talked even at the gala about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| I feel like that we're blessed to live in one of the most beautiful places in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8234)|
| 2:17:21| and I've got to travel all over the world so I can say that with some confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| I guess I would like to see Dogwood Arts get above this level and be to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8247)|
| 2:17:38| And I know that I think we just announced a new director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| She started Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| She's with me today, Lisa Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| Congratulations, Miss Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| And I would like for it to get back to that point at least of where it was 15 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8268)|
| 2:17:55| where when those prints came out, there was a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| You had to fight to get a print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| And you'd find articles about it all over the country, about the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| And I think that that's where it needs to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| because it is a big economic development boom for this community and the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8289)|
| 2:18:15| And if there's anything I can do, I would love to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| And that's a point well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| In our conversations and one of the things that we've tried to do the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| that I can speak for directly is get back to what the core values are of the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| As much notoriety and as flashy as things like air shows are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| those really aren't what the Dogwood Arts Festival should be about or have been about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| One of the things that we did this year that I forgot to mention was the parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| which we do every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| This year we moved it back to Friday night and got the high school bands involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| We had a few drop out because of the date change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| But we're really making a focused effort to get back to what the Dogwood Arts Festival has meant for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| I appreciate you serving as president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| I think you're a great leader this year for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| I enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| Thank you, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8349)|
| 2:19:39| Don't let them have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8379)|
| 2:20:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8412)|

| 2:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8996)|
| 2:29:59| You don't see him, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=8999)|
| 2:30:02| Star?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9002)|
| 2:30:12| And what star is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9012)|
| 2:30:15| Shangri-La?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| It's Shangri-La Therapeutic Academy of Writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| In our 21-year history here in this wonderful state and section of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| we have seen exceptional results in working with children and adults with mental, neurological, and physical disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9030)|
| 2:30:40| The grant that you see before you is actually an expansion of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9040)|
| 2:30:45| in that last year we did a pilot with the Lenore City System, their alternative school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9045)|
| 2:30:51| and it's working with at-risk youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9051)|
| 2:30:54| This is not unheard of in the industry, in the therapeutic horseback riding industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| However, it's very new to this area, and we're the only ones that do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| It was amazingly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| We basically have our strides to success, spelling out the words strides, safety, trust, integrity, respect, dedication, excellence, and sensitivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9064)|
| 2:31:14| You would be amazed at how many teenagers have no idea what respect is, have no idea what integrity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9074)|
| 2:31:21| And our goal is to instill that in them through a word of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| and then you set up scenarios where they're observing the horses because horses mimic our society, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| They have their own little world, and there's a top dog, there's a low dog, and there's all kinds of dogs in between, or horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| And you set up these different scenarios where the horses interact as they typically would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| and the students are observing, going, this makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| Because in their mind, our society makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| They have their own little world of how they think things should run, and it's not the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| So what we're doing is trying to teach them through observation and interaction with an animal that's about 1,000 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9113)|
| 2:32:00| And when you start getting cocky with a 1,000-pound animal, it doesn't go very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| Horses are very straightforward and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| You treat them with respect, and they will treat you with respect equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| And so that's part of how we're reaching these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| Judge Irwin has approached me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| We've met with his staff twice to see about starting a program through the Knox County system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| He wanted me to take all 400 of his individuals that are within the Juvenile Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| And I said, well, we can't really do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| Let's start small, start with a small pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| And actually, in meeting with his staff, we have decided that it's much more beneficial to work through the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| where the alternative children are within a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| They would come out as a class and remain as a unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| instead of it being up to the parents to bring them willy-nilly at different times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| or depending on the parents to get them there at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9167)|
| 2:32:50| So that's what this grant is going to do is to give us some of the starter money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| to get this program up and running through the Knox County Alternative School Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| so that we can start our STRIDES program within the Knox County system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| 67% of our clientele come from Knox County, even though our physical plant is in Lenore City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| We have 63 beautiful acres and a wonderful new facility that was not available to us within Knox County, I'm sorry to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9191)|
| 2:33:18| But the land price for a non-profit was available in Loudoun County, and that's why we locate it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9198)|
| 2:33:24| But again, our services are heavily geared towards the Knox County clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9210)|
| 2:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| You're welcome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| Crutcher Memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| Thank you for this opportunity and for your previous support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| My name is Mae Blanche Moore, and I am the program director for Crutcher Memorial Youth Enrichment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9231)|
| 2:33:58| Mrs. Shirley Walker is the facilitator for our Reading Counts program, and she will be making our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9238)|
| 2:34:06| I would also like to leave with you copies of our last year's brochure for additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9246)|
| 2:34:16| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| We're all aware of the budget cuts that you've had to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| We are aware of the crisis situation that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9261)|
| 2:34:25| But we want to appeal to you to reconsider and think about funding Crutcher Memorial Youth Enrichment Center's Reading Counts program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9265)|
| 2:34:34| When I looked at the count, the score count for Crutcher Memorial Youth Enrichment Center, I thought, well, surely they don't know what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9274)|
| 2:34:44| But we try to reach students one child at a time with a reading program that will enhance their academic performance in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9284)|
| 2:34:54| and later on in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| Crutcher Memorial Youth Enrichment Center was established in 1994 in memory of the Reverend W.T. Crutcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9296)|
| 2:35:02| It focuses on the academic excellence and constructive use of leisure time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| If you are a parent, a teacher, or if you are aware of children, you know what can happen when their leisure time is not constructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9308)|
| 2:35:17| CMY provides a valuable service to the community and inner city students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| The center is a non-profit organization and operated at a deficit last school year while still providing quality programs for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9323)|
| 2:35:32| Our budget last year was $46,080.58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9332)|
| 2:35:39| And our total operating expenses came to $47,367.19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9339)|
| 2:35:48| We operate primarily from the funding of grants and gifts supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| There is a small tuition fee of $100 a month for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| And if you consider that with the rising cost of gas, the utility bills and things will increase tremendously because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9357)|
| 2:36:06| What they pay will basically cover the mortgage and perhaps the van that we use to pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9366)|
| 2:36:17| Some of the programs offered and the expenses entailed are we have an etiquette class once a week and the instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9377)|
| 2:36:25| We have an art class, supplies, and art teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9385)|
| 2:36:29| There's music, piano lessons, supplies, and a music teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| Computers, supplies, and computer instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| Spanish, supplies, and instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| Reading, math, instructors, and tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| Sewing, class, supplies, and instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| The reading counts program, computers, books, quizzes, student incentives, and instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9405)|
| 2:36:52| Student assistance, teacher assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| We do have volunteers that come in and volunteer to work with our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9415)|
| 2:37:00| Some students from UT come in and read some of the books that are not with the reading counts program and put tests in the computer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9420)|
| 2:37:08| Other expenses I mentioned previously was the van and the van driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| The reading counts program provides the books at the student's reading level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| They spend time with someone on the staff discussing the book before they take a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| This program provides students with interest in reading, increases their comprehension and vocabulary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| All of these are skills that help improve student performance on their TCAP scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| We do ask our students for report cards and TCAP scores so that we can note improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9453)|
| 2:37:40| Our students read and tested over 200 books this school year at the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| And that's after coming to the center around 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| We are in need of additional books, quizzes, computers to successfully carry out this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9469)|
| 2:37:57| Without the grant, we would be unable to continue or expand this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9477)|
| 2:38:03| I'm certain that you're aware of the improving and increasing standards for the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| 2009-2010 school year, those standards will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| Any way that we can, any little bit that we can do to help improve the standards of our students, the scores of our students within the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9495)|
| 2:38:25| whether it's 10 students, 15 or 20, I'm certain that you would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| I'm certain that we're going to work as hard as we can to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9511)|
| 2:38:34| Thank you for your prior support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| Thank you for reconsidering this request for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| And hopefully that you will find that it is indeed something that we need for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| What is your budget overall for your program, excluding the grant that you've requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9534)|
| 2:39:01| For the Reading Counts program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| Right, right. Well, really for the whole...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| The whole school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| The whole school program, after school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| $47,367 was what it took to fund it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| We only had $46,000-something, so we were in the deficit about $1,000 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9554)|
| 2:39:21| In which schools do you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| Saramore Green, I'll let Ms. Blanche answer that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| Saramore Green, Green, Holston Middle, Spring Hill, Chill Howie, and Vine, particularly for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9567)|
| 2:39:41| Now, other students may come, but we cannot transport them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| So you all pick them up after school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| And then take them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| Yes, we stay within about a 10-mile radius of our location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| Okay. And I notice that there's a $100-a-month tuition fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| Is there a problem with some of your students and their families being able to afford that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9596)|
| 2:40:01| We do have a few cases like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| In one particular case, the father could not afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9604)|
| 2:40:09| so we agreed that he would do some custodial services for us in exchange for the tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9609)|
| 2:40:16| We try to work it out any way we can when we have cases like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| I've visited some of those programs over around Lawnsdale, these after-school programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9622)|
| 2:40:26| and for kids in some of those neighborhoods, they're just wonderful programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| and I know you're doing a good job with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9636)|
| 2:40:40| About how many students do you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| I mean, how many students are enrolled in your program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| Enrolled in our program, 20 to 25 each school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9645)|
| 2:40:53| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| Well, and I promise not to get stepped too high up on my soapbox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| but I am intimately familiar with this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9662)|
| 2:41:06| and it really is amazing that they can do what they do on the budget that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9666)|
| 2:41:12| That $46,000, it's pennies if you see what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9672)|
| 2:41:19| Myself, about 10 years ago, being a recently divorced single dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| was provided an invaluable service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| helping raise my two sons, I guess, at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| So CMY is a lot of retired educators, really stalwarts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| that take their time out of their busy schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| and spend a lot of time dealing with our children, teaching them, you know, excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| And it really is a wonderful, wonderful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| I'm a little biased, but it really is a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9711)|
| 2:41:56| Mr. McKenzie, I'm going to agree with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| but I'm like I wish there was some way we could lower that fee to some of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| that don't have the income, because those are the children that really need the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| They really need it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| Well, you know, and I spent years coaching youth athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9728)|
| 2:42:12| In fact, Commissioner Roundtree and I were outside talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| Free isn't always a good thing, and that's my personal belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9737)|
| 2:42:22| I think, you know, if it really is a situation where I don't have the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9742)|
| 2:42:28| they're always going to make arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| But if we give our kids too many things and our parents too many things for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9750)|
| 2:42:35| you know, they don't put the value into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| So, you know, I definitely understand what you're saying, but I think it's a balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9758)|
| 2:42:43| You're going to cut off the debate and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| Oh, see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| I could offer a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| I could amend that request for the grant for $9,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| and increase it so that we could reduce the tuition price for some of those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| I don't know whether I can talk to you anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| Let's consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9786)|
| 2:43:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| I was going to put my tooth in, and I guess I need to shut up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| I did speak at their banquet on behalf of County Commission two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| Gee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| I still had to put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Thomas Dean, One Love Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| Still not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| Disability Resource Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| She's here now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| I'm Kathy Hollander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| I'm the office manager for the Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| We're at 900 East Hill Avenue, Suite 120, Knoxville, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| I'd like to apologize for not being on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| Our resource developer is unavailable, and I didn't know until yesterday that I would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9836)|
| 2:44:02| We are one of six centers for independent living within the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| We serve Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| We serve people with all disabilities, any age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| We assist them in living independently within a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| Last year in Knox County, we served 627 people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9856)|
| 2:44:22| We had over 8,000 INRs, information referrals, where we referred people to other agencies within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9862)|
| 2:44:33| You have to excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| My allergies are getting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| We, as well as I heard Epilepsy Center say, we work with the Knoxville Area Transit Authority, the Lyft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9878)|
| 2:44:46| as far as disability etiquette, and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9886)|
| 2:44:49| We do trainings with the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| We are primarily funded through the Department of Education Rehab Service Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| Every year we get cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| This year they cut us $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Like everyone else, our rent goes up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| Our utilities go up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| $5,000 is a lot of money, and it's a lot of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| and a lot of services people are not going to get because we can't provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| We help people with housing, transportation, employment, medical needs, you name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| anything they need to live independently within a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| We do independent living trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| We go to Pat Neal when someone has a new spinal cord injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| We tell them what they have to do to get in their house, get around their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| and learn to adapt to their new way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| You may think you don't know anyone with a disability, but as the population ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9938)|
| 2:45:42| there's problems with hearing, vision, mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| We last year, since March of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| we built 21 ramps for people who couldn't otherwise afford a ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9948)|
| 2:45:54| We had one lady that had not left her house in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| Basically, like I said, I wasn't prepared to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| If you all have any questions, I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| I guess you did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| Montgomery Village Child Development Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9973)|
| 2:46:18| I'm impressed that you're having us back for three rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| That's just amazing, and I really do thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| I'm Connie Steele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9983)|
| 2:46:26| I'm also a volunteer, but have been president of the board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| for Montgomery Village Child Center almost since its inception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| We started when we found a three-year-old wandering around by himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| on the Montgomery Village HUD Authority campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| and decided we needed a child care center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| because these people needed to be able to go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| and find their children well cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| I really joined hands with the Sir More Green and Green of the year after school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| because that's what we came to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| We have been fortunate to have some funding from the lottery educational after school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10017)|
| 2:47:05| from the governor, but two years ago they agreed that we needed at least $7.50 a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| to take care of children for after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| And when we asked for those, we first, two years ago, were funded with $37,143.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10034)|
| 2:47:21| Costs about $75,000 for that one program in our center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10041)|
| 2:47:27| which takes care of children six weeks through fifth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| But I'm focusing on what is happening with our after schoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| In South Knoxville, we have a bus that we were required to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10055)|
| 2:47:40| by Department of Human Services for an effective way to transport children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| from Dogwood, Moreland Heights, Mount Olive, and South Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10065)|
| 2:47:51| As we have done that, we realize how well children can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| We're told by the teachers, we know that, how you're working with our children after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| in literacy, in mathematics, in science efforts, as well as physical education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10080)|
| 2:48:07| And we use the things that have to do with counting, with naming, with vocabulary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10087)|
| 2:48:13| even with reading in talking about how a child can have fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| The director, Dan Hazlett, could not come this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| but what he is initiating today is a complete computer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10101)|
| 2:48:27| In fact, for the after schoolers, that will be the first program initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10107)|
| 2:48:32| And we feel very fortunate that Senators Tim Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| and Jamie Woodson have provided us with some dollars to begin that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| We will have evaluation of those children's skills in math, in literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10121)|
| 2:48:46| in the way they can read, in their science projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10126)|
| 2:48:50| which of course we are taking note of, and numerous field trips throughout Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10130)|
| 2:48:55| so that these children can come to know what's happening in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| In South Knox, we're the only unit that is open for after school all year round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10140)|
| 2:49:06| with these same programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10146)|
| 2:49:09| And we are the only one that has also the transportation for transporting the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| Forty percent of our children come from Montgomery Village Housing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| The others are mostly in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| We have support from United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| We're a United Way agency, but it's only 9% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| We feel fortunate to have 6,300 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| but it's from Vestal Properties, Inc., and of course paid $1,250 a month for our lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10174)|
| 2:49:42| The things that happen with children are each child's anecdote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10182)|
| 2:49:47| A mother came to me the other day and she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| Connie, I don't know what I would do this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| if my child weren't able to come to your program, but I can't afford it, she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10193)|
| 2:50:00| So what we're coming to you about is dollars so that we can not only afford the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10200)|
| 2:50:07| that's going into place, that we can hire someone that is licensed in literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10207)|
| 2:50:14| and especially math because the TCAT scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10214)|
| 2:50:18| the Tennessee Comprehensive Achievement Test scores from these four grade schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| are low as compared not only with the state, but of course nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| I'm very proud of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| We are really pleased with a computerized program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| that will evaluate the progress that our children make throughout this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| We have also provided a larger space in old Vestal Elementary School where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10240)|
| 2:50:47| and we hope to have 30 children by September 1, especially from the south Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10247)|
| 2:50:56| There's lots to be known about what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| I'll be glad to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10259)|
| 2:51:04| Seeing none, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| If you're here for Mayor Haslund's Council on Disability Issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| it's going to be in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| I saw some people that came in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| Next we have Cerebral Palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10279)|
| 2:51:31| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| I'm Bob Sexton, the Executive Director of the Cerebral Palsy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10292)|
| 2:51:37| I just want to tell you a little bit about our agency and the current affairs that we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10297)|
| 2:51:44| Of course, all of our work is sort of coming off a base of knowing that nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| about 78% of all adults with significant disabilities are unemployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| and also knowing from a study the National Council on Education did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| that after high school graduation, after graduation from special education services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10321)|
| 2:52:07| two years down the road, only 13% of young people with significant disabilities have jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10327)|
| 2:52:14| So what this means is that we have a tremendous waste of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10334)|
| 2:52:21| that have been invested in education of young people with significant disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10341)|
| 2:52:26| when 90 or 80-something percent of them are going back home after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10346)|
| 2:52:33| and sitting on the couch and watching TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| There's a tremendous domino effect with the rest of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10357)|
| 2:52:41| I cannot begin to count the hundreds of family members, moms and dads that I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10361)|
| 2:52:48| who've had to drop out of the workforce, quit their jobs in order to sit at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10368)|
| 2:52:53| with their child with a disability, their adult child, in order to provide care and supervision of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10373)|
| 2:53:00| And I think all of us, if we think for a moment, can sort of figure out the very negative results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10380)|
| 2:53:07| of an unemployment rate of 78% for adults and how we feel about ourselves who are employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10387)|
| 2:53:16| You know, in our country, having a job is very powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10396)|
| 2:53:19| Not only does it help us to support ourselves financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10399)|
| 2:53:23| but also it sort of defines us as someone who has value to other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10403)|
| 2:53:29| as someone that an employer is willing to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| and that we're seen as someone that's willing to get up in the morning and make our own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080611granthearings?start=10412)|
