| 0:11:55| The applicant states that the concept would create a scenario where the alley would no longer be necessary to access any of the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| The development would also create one lot out of the existing parcels in the abandoned alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| The staff recommendation is to deny the closure of the unnamed alley of Cumberland Avenue between South 21st and 22nd Streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| as it is an active alley that provides connectivity to an area of high congestion with several one-way streets and restricted turning options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=738)|

| 0:12:56| So they want to withdraw their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=776)|

| 0:16:51| Okay, applicant, would you prefer to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| No, I'll go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| I'm Benjamin Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| I'm here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| I've just been involved in this case a little over a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Since that time, I've met with staff and talked to them about this, and I've also had conversations with Mr. O'Neill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| This was originally filed in October, and it was postponed for 60 days to allow there to be conversations with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1033)|
| 0:17:22| After looking at those conversations and where we left them and having follow-up conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| I believe there's still additional work that could be done with the neighborhood to try to work out something that would benefit both my clients and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1048)|
| 0:17:37| So we would like to request a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| I missed the deadline to do that automatically, so I'm here asking for the commission to please vote to postpone it to allow us to continue those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1061)|

| 0:18:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| I see no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1098)|

| 0:18:31| Next is agenda item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| This is going to be two motions, two votes, one for rezoning, one for sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| The rezoning report applicant is Joseph and Rebecca Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| The location is the north side of East Emory Road, southeast of its intersection with Dan McBee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1124)|
| 0:18:52| The track information is 1.54 acres total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| 9901 East Emory Road, 015004 is 0.86 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1136)|

| 0:19:15| The present plan designation is Single Family Residential and Agricultural Forestry Vacant A Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| Proposed plan designation and zoning is Rural Residential PR Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| The existing land use is Single Family Residential Detached Houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| The proposed use, the applicant would like to have these properties platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| They are currently only deeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| The density proposed is two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Deny the sector plan amendment request to amend this parcel's designation to Rural Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| because it's not in character with the surrounding agricultural designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and there are no other similar land use designations nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| Also to deny the PR Planned Residential zoning because it does not meet the intent of PR zoning as described in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| and it is not consistent with the sector plan which does not cover over one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Ma'am, would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| And I do want to welcome Rebecca Longmire who was a long time Metropolitan Planning Commissioner and Chair before I assumed the role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1223)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Rebecca Longmire, 9909 East Emory Road, Corrieton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| First of all, I want to say I totally understand why the staff did what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| That said, I don't agree with it because I think you need to know a little bit about the background of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| The first house, the one closest to Dan McBee Road, was built in probably the late 1930s, early 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| In 1961, the lady who owned the first house let her daughter build a house which is the second house on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1262)|
| 0:21:12| So basically you had two dwelling units on not quite two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| And that's the problem we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| We did buy the property because it's at the bottom of our driveway and we wanted to maybe do a little bit of control about how the houses would be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1280)|
| 0:21:29| But we would like to plat that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| We have the deed and that's fine, but if we could get the PR zoning on those two pieces of property, we would be able to plat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1292)|
| 0:21:42| If you look at the survey lines, they're a little odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| And apparently when the property was surveyed to let the second house be built, there was some effort to make sure that there was extra property given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1308)|
| 0:22:00| It's a very strange situation, but we have no desire to do anything else in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| We simply would like those two pieces of property rezoned, and I know it does take a sector plan change, so that we can get that property platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1327)|
| 0:22:17| And if you have any questions, I would be glad to try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Yes, I'd just like to again state to the Commissioner, as we stated at the agenda review, this was a challenging one for the staff for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1343)|
| 0:22:31| Not only because of our knowledge of Ms. Longmire and Mr. Longmire, but also the challenge that's presented is not uncommon in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| We have properties that do not meet the zoning standards, that may have been deeded and never platted, and it puts the owners in a difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1360)|
| 0:22:49| We had a lot of discussion at staff level looking for an option out of this and trying to be objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| Our recommendation is based on objectivity, and I can understand Ms. Longmire's not agreeing with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1376)|
| 0:23:06| You didn't have to be that objective, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| There was some disagreement among staff, and we went back and forth several times until we realized that one of our key things is being true to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1390)|
| 0:23:21| And I will present to the Commission, this is a recommendation, it's up to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| You're in the hot seat, and I don't envy you any more than I envy DUS as we considered and discussed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| and realizing again that this challenge is present throughout the county, where lots did not meet the zoning standards, and there are a number along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1415)|
| 0:23:45| Your neighbors, many of your neighbors have lots that the lot size do not meet the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| Well, when you have an older area of the county that was developed and people would give their children property, you know, nothing was thought about acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1432)|
| 0:24:02| You just wanted your kid to have a place to live, and that's basically what happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| The lady was older, she wanted her daughter near, and that's what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| which leaves us holding a very strangely shaped bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Okay, Commissioner Luton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Ms. Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Mr. Luton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Would a RA zone work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| I'm curious what the difference between the PR request and the RA in this particular case, because we do have some RA that's contiguous to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| I would like to refer that to staff, because I was advised to go for PR because of the size of the lots more than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1477)|
| 0:24:47| One of the lots is very close to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| The other is about three quarters of an acre, so if staff could speak to that, I would really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| The RA zone, I think, it's 20,000 square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Right, so that would be half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| We bounced the two back and forth, and one would work as well as the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| We were looking for different angles, and one angle would be to look at all the Longmire's properties, the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| and allocate the density throughout and allow any size lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| So it was one, no real preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| One just rose to the top a bit more than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| If we know we have some boundaries that this isn't going to be added on to, I would be okay with an RA zone change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1529)|
| 0:25:39| if that was something that would be considered as we talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Ms. Porche, would you like to comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Either the RA or the PR zoning would require the sector plan amendment, so either way you would be voting on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| So it's just whether the land use would allow the RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| So I'm kind of looking at that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| So we would not be able to vote on an RA zoning since it was published as a PR, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| We can postpone it for the RA consideration or proceed with the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Proceed with the PR, and as Ms. Porche stated, either one would require a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| And LDR does allow RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| So the sector plan would need to be amended from agricultural to LDR to allow the RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1595)|
| 0:26:44| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| We've already got two homes on the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| It's already been deeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| All we're talking about is basically a technical issue of planning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| The improvements are there, so it's not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| I would make a motion that we approve the rural residential designation as a change of conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1622)|
| 0:27:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Yeah, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| I second it, so I do support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| What's the downside of having this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| Originally, I thought RA would be a good option, but you have to do a sector plan change for either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| That makes that a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| What's the downside of making this what they're asking, the PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| It becomes a spot sector plan amendment and a spot zoning, and that's the biggest challenge is just having this little spot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| Staffing thought that initiating a broader sector plan amendment to address and zoning to address not only the Longmire's property, but some of their adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1675)|
| 0:28:06| That may be something, and I can say this with a smile on my face now, that we may consider in six months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1686)|
| 0:28:17| There's a fine line between intelligence and being chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Well, I mean, I have to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| I think it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Everything's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Even though the owners are irresponsible people, I think we can trust them a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| How sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I never thought I'd hear that from Mr. Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Yeah, the other RA, Rebecca, I think her property is zoned RA now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Directly, but the sector plan is not different under that RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| No, the zoning is not supported by the sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| So could that be considered an error that we could fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| I mean, it's zoned RA now and it's under the ag sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| It's not advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| And that's something where we need to look at this a bit more broadly as a sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1752)|
| 0:29:21| Ms. Elbertson, did you have, I saw you pulling your, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Commissioner Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| I think we're all trying to see if we can find a solution for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| But I guess for those that have made the motion and made the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| what is the reason for the sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| What was the change in conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| The development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| The growth of the area out there warrants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Yeah, it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I think recognizing the development pattern could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Recognizing the development pattern could be added to that justification for the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1793)|
| 0:30:02| So, I'm kind of conflicted on this because I agree that I don't like to see spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1802)|
| 0:30:14| And I agree that the RA makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| But I understand the challenges in needing to do a sector plan amendment to even support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1819)|
| 0:30:29| We've got more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Is Steve Wise here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| He has recused on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Oh, he recused. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| He's chicken, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| It seems to me that in the past, once you opened up a piece of property for rezoning, you weren't guaranteed what you were going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1842)|
| 0:31:00| And that's what Ms. Longmire has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| This is opened up for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| And in our judgment, what do we want to put on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| What do we think is the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| And I think you can do that without re-advertising it because it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| I'm going to check on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Amy and I are discussing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I think we have in the past...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| And I know we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I think we've had a bit of latitude in similar zones, but we're going to check to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| And there may be a possibility to do the RA, which would be more compatible with the existing zoning pattern out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| I know we used to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Yeah. But do we want to put this aside and go on while she checks on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| No, we have a couple more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| We have some other commissioners I'd like to opine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Thanks, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I'd like to say hello to Ms. Longmire also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Mr. Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I've been on the commission long enough to know that we make a lot of concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Just two months ago, we made a concession for a young man who was an immigrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| And I think Art Clancy made the motion to help him in a car dealership, a car lot he was trying to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1932)|
| 0:32:20| I know the Longmires have been staples in the community out there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| I don't think either one of them to do anything that would be detrimental to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| So, for that reason, I'd fully support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Okay. And our attorney has said that we could consider the RA zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| And the sector plan amendment, that would be compatible with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| There's no legal impediment to considering the RA zoning under the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1960)|
| 0:32:50| And we'd need a sector plan amendment also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Would the sector plan amendment be the same sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| I think it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| For RA, it would be LDR sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| So, instead of rural residential, it would be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Okay. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Yes, I just want to make sure I understand that if we approve this, and I'm looking for a way to approve it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1989)|
| 0:33:18| they are in a non-conforming situation right now. Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| So, I think the public needs to be aware that, you know, we are changing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| And by it being non-conforming, yes, the structures are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| But in the future, the reason we have non-conforming is so that they won't be there as we move on to that consistent zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| So, I do like the RA option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| In order to do that, the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| I will amend my motion. Do I need to delete that or can I just amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| Amend it to LDR sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Can you wait just a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Thank you. Commissioner Kraft, are your lights still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Commissioner Crowder, are your lights still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| There you go. Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Yes, Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| I was trying to think. I mean, this area is designated in the rural area of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| And I was thinking that of the zoning districts that could be considered, I didn't think RA was one of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| PR was typically the zoning, residential zoning district that's listed under the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| And RA was not one that we considered in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| But apparently it was considered at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| I don't know what the timing was of the other, but anyway, I just thought I'd mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| So, to make sure I understand, we would be, if we are making this RA zoning, then we would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| just this one piece of property would have the sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Okay. Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Amend my motion to approve the LDR designation for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| I just can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Okay, so the motion is to approve the sector plan amendment request to amend this parcel's designation to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2120)|
| 0:35:33| because of the development changes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| And to be consistent with the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And to be consistent with the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| Okay, I see no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2155)|

| 0:36:00| Motion to approve RA zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| And would that also include sidewalks, Ms. Longmeyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I think we ought to condition it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| We'll build a sidewalk to the little mailbox right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| Without the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| I see no lights on. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Any opposed? The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you. And thank you, Commissioners, for thinking outside of the box and coming up with a solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| I appreciate it. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2204)|

| 0:40:43| Hi. Christy Anderson Nutter, 3311 Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you. Sir, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| The lady first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Okay. Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you. Again, I'm Christy Nutter at 3311 Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| I am here on behalf of my property, which adjoins or is very close to where Mr. North is attempting to rezone to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| I am here with a number of my family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| If you'd raise your hand to show that we are all here in opposition to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| First and foremost, I'd like to address the fact that this property has a fourth generation property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| When my husband and I first got this property 33 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| we put a two-bedroom trailer on it and raised three children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| and saved for 12 years until we could build the existing structure that's there that's now our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| We never were offered the opportunity to buy the piece of property that Mr. North is wanting to expand into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| Right now, residential is our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| We don't want a business in front of, I don't want a business in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| We have a right-of-way in front of my house, and then I would be directly looking at Mr. North's landscaping property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| My other question about that or my other concerns with regards to changing the zoning is the entrances to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| We haven't seen any sort of plan from him with regards to how he would bring trucks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| and how customers would come in and how all that would work during and off during business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| We're also concerned with the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| I realize that he has to put some sort of a tree buffer in there, but even now in the summertime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| at the very corner where he is located at this time, we hear him over there loading trucks, cutting wood, all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| I don't know about you on a Saturday morning, but that's about the only day I get to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| Also, he has, I know, had an issue with theft at least one time on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| Right now and before he tore down the house that was in front of us, we could go outside, raise our garage doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| My grandson could play in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| They play basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| They ride their bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| We have a lot of children in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| Once a business goes in there, not only are we going to have large trucks and people who have never been in our area coming in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2576)|
| 0:43:04| but we're also going to have to deal with maybe someone who gets on that property once again that wants to possibly rob or do something to Mr. Norris' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| They see our home, and all of a sudden they think, wonder what's over there, wonder what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| I just feel like at this point, at this time, it is not in the best interest of the community or the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| to allow the rezoning of the piece of property into commercial for him to expand his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Well, I'm not the speaker that some of these people are, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| but I talked to Christy before that I did this, and she was worried about it being landlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| and I talked to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| The board recommended it was okay that it wouldn't landlock her, and I have my own entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| They're worried about the alleyway, the side street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| I use the other entrance that I have coming in, and I agree to put up the buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| and that will also protect her from her noise and any dust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and she did have the opportunity to buy this piece of property that I bought from Mr. Bryce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| As a matter of fact, all the neighbors had the same opportunity I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| because it was a condemned old house, and it had been grown up for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| and I hope you received some letters from the other neighbors that have agreed how I've been there four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| and I've done nothing but clean up the properties, both of them was just rat holes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| and even across the street on Mr. Baby's property around the curve were super dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| but I keep it mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| I cleaned out all the tree lines, and I was mowing the grass in this piece of property in front of her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2679)|
| 0:44:46| before I even bought it, because I wanted it to look good on my little landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| because it's just a little small mom-and-pop mow chart, and the community loves us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| and so I just need a room to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| If I don't grow, I'll eventually die out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| And eventually, it's all going to be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| There's only two strips left, and you look at the map, and eventually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Christy will probably be able to, you know, if she wanted to, rezone hers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| and, you know, it'll be worth a lot more money for some big company down the road for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| But, you know, that's all I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| I'm just trying to grow my business, and I do nothing to hurt the neighborhood, and she knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| You know, I've cleaned it up, and she's thanked me a hundred times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| and I'm very careful about making noises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| She's at work most of the time, and my business don't start until 8 to 6 through the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| and 8 to 3 on Saturdays and closed Sundays and Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| And she was wired the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| That's the noisiest thing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| It's a lot more noisy than I am, and the co-yard's been there 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| So, you know, they chose to build behind the commercial property to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2749)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Yeah, I was going to ask the gentleman, do you process mulch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| No, sir. All I am is a retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| I just have it in bins, and I sell it by the bobcat scoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| But, no, there will be no grinding and processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| And it's mostly decorative stone, pea gravels, topsoil, mulch, and pine straw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| everything for the homeowners to decorate their landscape with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| Okay, and you are proposing buffering along the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Arborvitae green giants, which will grow 30 foot tall, makes a beautiful landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| so I have to give Christy plenty of privacy, and it will even help all the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| And I'm willing, if she'll buy the trees, when I go to plant these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| I'll plant a buffer along the railroad tracks, just as a courtesy, as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| So that would even make her property even quieter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| Okay. And then, what about lighting or hours, anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| Eight to six. It's daylight when I come in, and some of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| I will put up some street lights, like I do mine, for protection, and some cameras, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| so you will be able to keep an eye on, you know, if there's anybody that shouldn't be there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| to Avery and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| With regard to the lighting, under the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| there are lighting standards for non-residential developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| so the lighting that Mr. Norton put up would have to be, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| cut off lighting fixtures and no spillage of light onto the neighboring residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| Yeah, it would be more like KUB put up some along the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| When I got robbed, they'd come out and put up lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| So it's all done by KUB, you know, just, it's a low light, so it wouldn't bother her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| She could still, you know, at night, it wouldn't affect her sleep and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| Ms. Nutter, which house is yours? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| I live at 3311 Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| It's the two-story house directly behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Down next to the railroad track, adjacent to the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Yes, we're on the upper end. The railroad tracks are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| The one where the cursor's pointing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Just for my understanding, 3309, that's the existing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| And the current zoning of that property is residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| And that's I-G under the new zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| That's I-G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| The old one was I-3, heavy industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Is there any more discussion, or do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Motion to approve the L.I. Light Industrial Designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| because it corrects the non-conforming zoning and because the area is transitioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| to industrial and commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2944)|

| 0:49:23| See no other lights on. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| I had a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| There were three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| There were three noes. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2980)|

| 0:49:48| for 3313 Mill Road because the area is transitioning to industrial and commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| subject to the condition that a landscaping buffer be installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| on lot lines shared with residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3003)|

| 0:50:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3011)|

| 0:50:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Same three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| We do still have the plan amendment report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| which is the previous, it's still item number 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| but the previous sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| This is the one year report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| The one year plan adopting the resolution 1A20SB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| That should have been done first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| That should have been the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| That should have been the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| The second plan, one year plan and two plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| The plan amendment report should be before those two sheets that you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| Still agenda item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| LRE did the LI designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| I'll go ahead and make a motion to adopt resolution 1A20SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| amending the sector plan to L1 as it corrects non-conforming zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| in the areas transitioning to industrial and commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| subject to the condition that a type A landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| be installed on shared lot lines with residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| a second by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| to adopt the resolution amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Janice, are we doing the sector plan over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| This is the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| There's a sector plan, one year plan, and then the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| Because this is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| And so one year also needs amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| So this is what we're reading now is the one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| This is the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| It's basically the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| It's the same language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| That was kind of out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| The resolution goes with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| So I think we did the one year plan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Thanks for keeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| So this one year plan, sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| one year plan, rezoning, and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| I'm thinking about stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| But I just, I don't know, I don't want to try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| I guess we can't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| I just feel weird about having residential homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| and we're changing zoning on properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| from residential to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| It's just that close to people's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| I just think we ought to give it some thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Even though it is near the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| but it's, you know, it's still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| there are residential homes over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| and I don't mean anything against your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| I want you to be very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| But I want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| I think we should try to be real considerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| of people who live right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| And like you said, it's more just like canopy and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| It's a lot beside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| And, you know, you see across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| at Mr. Bayberry's, it's all industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| And on the other side of the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| I mean, it's full of commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| There's one strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| the only thing it's not commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| from there to Worcester Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| So, you know, you can't take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| And it's just going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I hope the neighborhood grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| And like I said, I'm not doing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| to harm the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| I've done nothing but clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| and try to make it nicer for the whole neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| Ma'am, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| I would like to say that I agree with what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| He mowed that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| because the prior owner had passed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| and the people who owned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| were doing nothing to maintain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| which is why the house fell down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| It's only smart business for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| to keep that lawn mowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| so that everybody could see where his business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I think he's a nice guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| I have nothing against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I'm saying this is my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| This is our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| This is our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| I'm not saying he's trying to harm us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| I'm trying to say that we don't want to lose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| I didn't know 33 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| that this was our home land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| It was our home property for generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| And we hope for it to be there a lot longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| without a business in my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| The only other thing I would mention is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| and I may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| but if he goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| or if he decides to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| can any industrial use go in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| that could be a lot more intrusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| than a mulch yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| We're permanently changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| what's going to happen over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| So, that's my situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| Commissioner Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| I hate to beat a dead horse here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| but I reflect back to Mrs. Longmire's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| And here we're stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| that we're trying to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| We're fixing a non-conforming use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| on part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| He's expanding on part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| She had a non-conforming use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| She wouldn't expand any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| All she was trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| was just subdivide a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| This is adding on to a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| I'm a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I buy that that is a transitioning area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| I think there's a bunch of office warehouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| And I think one of these days at Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| that might be a hub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| for everything that staff is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| I think it would be more appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| to have looked at it holistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| for a sector plan update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| where that whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| maybe through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| gets looked at from a sector plan standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| And doing it piecemeal like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| I don't see any difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| in what we did with Mrs. Longmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| I had a better feeling with the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| So that's why I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| We do have a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| With regards to the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| to adopt the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| amending this sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| to LI Light Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| that was made by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| and seconded by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Let's go ahead and vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Four now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=3397)|

| 1:08:06| John King Post Office Box 2425 Knoxville, TN 37901 I'm still trying to follow what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4086)|
| 1:08:17| involved here and I think I am but what I believe him to have outlined is approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| two times as much sidewalk as we were talking about insofar as what the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4105)|
| 1:08:37| was and I certainly haven't had an opportunity to talk to Mr. Snowden about it but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4117)|
| 1:08:52| in a position where we can agree with the staff recommendation, the current staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| which as outlined in essence replaces the condition and results in the building of sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4139)|
| 1:09:12| from the entry point, basically the entry point into the subdivision development back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| to Schott Road on as you look at it what would be on the left side and like I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| as I understand they're talking about a lot more sidewalk than that and we're still inclined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4169)|
| 1:09:42| to support the position and we do support the position of staff as to what should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| required and I'll yield the remainder of my time and I'll address further what every staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4190)|
| 1:09:59| suggestion what staff recommendation is I think that Mr. Bretschko needs to perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4199)|
| 1:10:08| discuss that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Yes sir, there is still a little bit of time on opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Max Reddick, I'm at 2022 Country Brook Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4217)|
| 1:10:27| Two things to say is that one to have it benefit the neighborhood in some way to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| kind of connection to it is important but also safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| Cars move very fast up and down Pleasant Ridge and so not only to have it be a benefit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| our community but to be a safe access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| The green option that we're proposing headed towards Schott I don't think is a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| length and so I just want to as rebuttal say that that was our first option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| The other one that we mentioned would probably be considered greater but just want to, someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4264)|
| 1:11:12| probably needs to take measurements if they want to be scientific about it but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| all I would add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| The blue option is, looks to me like it is a lot shorter than the green option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4284)|
| 1:11:33| The blue option looks to be half but even so the green option, even so the green option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| looks to be less than the total amount of sidewalk that would be for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Okay, I'm trying to think through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| The developer has requested to eliminate this requirement for sidewalks on the approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| I don't think we can, I think we all are in agreement that we cannot allow that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| so basically there is a bond hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Right now the developer as I understand it could forfeit his bond and that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| Does anybody know how much the bond is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Okay, so I just feel like it's going to be really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Mr. Bretschko has an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| In early discussions I believe 60,000 was identified amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| Mr. King had raised the issue that they thought there was 110 and I think the county has looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| closer at that and there was an additional 50,000 that was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| I'm not sure and the county would be able to clarify that a little bit better whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| there's actually 110,000 that's still there in the bond amounts whether it could be all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| used for sidewalks or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| And Tom is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| I had even told Mr. King that the file that I had did have 60,000 but this thing is spradling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| places quite old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| I think it might have been platted in 2006 or 2007 so there was another 50,000 that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| in an old bond so we do have $110,000 for roadway or infrastructure improvements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| would include sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Okay, so the developer is coming to us because he wants to get out from under this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| But if we ask him to build sidewalks that cost $130,000, he's just going to say take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| my 110 and I'm done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Okay, so we really can't, I don't see how we as the Planning Commission can, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| deny his request to take the requirement off that, making sure it's still there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| then he is the one that's going to have to figure out with the county how they come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| an end on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| I guess one thing, and this gentleman brings up some good points, what we were trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| do was for the amount of bond that was left to find the location of sidewalks that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| provide the most value for the most residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| I mean, granted, it doesn't necessarily directly affect them as much as we would like either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| but it was my understanding, and maybe Curtis can speak to this, I know the city at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| point had a project to redo Pleasant Ridge and that's, I think up to a certain point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4465)|
| 1:14:34| and I don't know if we can pull it up on KGIS there, Pleasant Ridge Road is in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| and then it goes into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| I think what we were trying to do was build the sidewalks that were inside the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| with this bond and then maybe a future city project would add sidewalks to connect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| their subdivision and further take them east on Pleasant Ridge, but I don't know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| status of that city project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| I guess my only point is that the only recourse we have in terms of this deal is the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| ability to keep the $110,000 because the sidewalks didn't get built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| So, first of all, I think we deny his request to eliminate that and then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Which is what staff's recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| Yeah, but I don't know about, like when we're talking with neighbors about different routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| for other sidewalks, we don't know if there's right-of-way that has to be purchased to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| sidewalks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| I don't know that I could make a decision about where they should go, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| Yeah, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| The map that's up there now, Pleasant Ridge Road in front of the subdivision is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| within the city and it goes a little bit towards the west there, kind of in a little point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| triangle right there, so that's actually within the city and that kind of complicates the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| issue of whether or not any sidewalk can be put in the area that's shown in blue on their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| map or part of that green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Now from where the county road starts up to the existing sidewalk is about a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| feet, about a similar length to what was on staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| There are some areas there that are a little flat, but then there's an area along the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| that has steeper grades and I'm not sure if there's rock or what kind of issues there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| may be to grade or retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| There's also some landscaping buffers that have been put up, so what can actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| achieved with the money available is probably less on the proposed side, the green side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4593)|
| 1:16:41| although that would be a more direct benefit to the residents in Spradlin Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| But again, there's apparently more money available and I think when the county first came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| with a recommendation on that stretch that's being proposed, they were trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| the issue where there's a mid-block crossing and by putting that sidewalk on that one section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| takes it up to Shod Road, puts sidewalks on both sides and makes a safer connection on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| that plank, knowing that eventually with the city project and some additional improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| that there would be sidewalks on both sides through the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| So the initial recommendation was looking at probably the easiest and cheapest section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| of sidewalk to put in, but again, there is a section on their side that does not connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| directly to their subdivision, but has a little more challenges on grading and all that stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| I know we still have some Commissioner Lights on, but I'd like to hear from the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| You probably have some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| Name is Terry Ware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| I'm the developer, 137 Lewisville, I mean 137 Hidden Circle, Lewisville, 37777.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4671)|
| 1:18:00| The reason that we come here and ask for the sidewalk provision to be dropped is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| it's impossible to put the sidewalks inside the subdivision that meet ADA regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| So I was told by the engineering department, if I went in there and installed the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| and they did not meet the ADA regulations, they still would not release the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4698)|
| 1:18:24| The only way to get the bond situation is to have that provision taken off, the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| stipulation taken out, then they wanted me to put some sidewalks in a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| I agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| So even if they take the bond, I don't do the sidewalks, and they take the bond, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| county says they will not put sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| So they're not going to have sidewalks inside the subdivision either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| And the issue is just the bond and the stipulation of the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| You know, if we get that removed, then we can clear up the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| I'd like to add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| If you look back at this on the, let's go to the, go toward, go the other way, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4750)|
| 1:19:22| On the side opposite this development, all the way up to Shod Road, it's relatively flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4762)|
| 1:19:31| and we've got right-of-way that's the county's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| And they've said that they will, in essence, and wanted us to go along within their right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| and to the extent that there is any place along in there that you don't have enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| right-of-way, the county's willing to cooperate to acquire it so that there's not any issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| We don't have any kind of assurances on the other side of the road, on the opposite side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| from where we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| But it's a situation, again, if I'm looking at this, what they're suggesting does add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4811)|
| 1:20:22| more linear feet of sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| That portion of it is an area that may be questionable about the right-of-way, but at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4824)|
| 1:20:32| least we know what we've got to deal with between the subdivision development and Shod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4832)|
| 1:20:39| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| That's what the county said they preferred, and that's what we said we were willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| I'm going to agree with Commissioner Smith here and say that I think the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| staff recommendation, given the discussion that's going on now, there's a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| of need for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| The appropriate staff recommendation is to deny the bond or deny the request to release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| the sidewalk requirement, but the Engineering Public Works and the developer working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| the neighborhood and planning staff would be willing to help facilitate those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| to decide what to do with that bond money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| There are a lot of details that have come up now that are beyond the purview of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| commission that belong rightfully with Engineering Public Works, the neighborhood, and the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| developer, and they're, again, beyond the purview of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| This commission has one decision to make, and that's in my view, and that's whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| to release the site or deny or approve the request of the applicant to release the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| The appropriate staff recommendation is to deny that request and allow the, again, allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| them to work it out from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| I agree that all these proposals, I didn't agree with any of them because I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4921)|
| 1:22:13| that we should be doing anything off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| I don't think that the developer should be required to build 1,000 feet of sidewalk somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4939)|
| 1:22:29| His requirement was to put sidewalks in that subdivision, and it seems to me that somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4949)|
| 1:22:37| along the line, Knox County was as much at fault as the developer was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4957)|
| 1:22:47| It should have been stopped right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| If you can't do it, stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| You've got inspectors on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Get the requirement removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| We can't do this, but you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| I think there's as much blame on both sides as there is on the developer or on the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| side, and I'm adamantly opposed to any off-site improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| The people that bought in there paid, they've already paid for the sidewalk when they bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| the house, and they didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| They deserve something, and I think it ought to go back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| What do we want in our subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| They might just want a healthy donation to their homeowners association and walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| That works, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Mr. Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| I agree with part of what Commissioner Graf says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| Like Mr. Ware says, the issue is that they can't put the sidewalks in, but in 2012, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| concept plan was approved based on installing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| It should have been put in when the development was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| I know that it's difficult to do that as you're developing, but still, in 2012, we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| could have gotten the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Now, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| I think the county's proposal to put a redundant sidewalk in down the other side of Pleasant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| Ridge is the worst of the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| I agree that what the homeowners association or the people in Spradling Place were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5069)|
| 1:24:37| was that bond money can't be used for anything but sidewalks, and that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| They wanted, and I think Mr. Walker got up to say that, they would have liked to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| seen maybe an amenity in their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| If it can only be used for sidewalks, I say that the city engineering and the county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| The blue line is obviously the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| There's sidewalks that will go from Chaud Road up to the school, except for that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| blue line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| That may be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| The green one, probably a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Whichever one, I think we need to deny the request, let the county and the city work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5117)|
| 1:25:28| out an amenity of some sort, whether it be sidewalks here or sidewalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| I think the most useless plan is the one that Knox County Engineering is proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| right now of redundant sidewalks from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| It just doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| I agree with Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| I think all we need to do is make a decision whether we deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| If I may, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| You have 43 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| 43 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| Rather than deny this, I'd ask for a postponement, try to follow the suggestions of Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5161)|
| 1:26:14| and get the county engineering involved, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| Usually the more cooks in the kitchen, the tougher it gets, but if it's necessary to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| reach a resolution of something on this, we can get with county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5186)|
| 1:26:37| I believe the city already has something going forward on sidewalks that would impact the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5197)|
| 1:26:46| situation on sidewalks that are, I guess, within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5206)|
| 1:26:53| All right, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| I'd just ask for a postponement, if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| We still got some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| I'd like to hear from the city with regards to what's happening with sidewalks on Pleasant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Based on some information that was sent to me a couple of years ago, there is a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| that was planned for Pleasant Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| It looks like a roadway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| That's not a project that I manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| It's actually managed through our civil division, so it's a different division of our engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| It looks like there are some proposals for sidewalks in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| Exactly where the extents of that project begin and end, I'd be reluctant to say, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| it's something that I think we would be willing to meet with the applicant and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| Engineering and see if there was a way to work together to maybe reach a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| I would like to ask Mr. Ware a question first and then follow up with some comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| Mr. Ware, I'd like to visit, I guess, the root cause of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| Mr. King wasn't explicitly clear yesterday or Tuesday in our agenda review as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| sidewalks weren't put in in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I don't think you really expect for us to just release the bond if there was a promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| made to the future residents, a promise made to the county, and then nothing delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5305)|
| 1:28:33| The reason that they weren't put in to begin with is because of the terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| It's impossible to put sidewalks in that subdivision and to meet the ADA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5318)|
| 1:28:45| If I put the sidewalks in, they will not meet the ADA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| I have the expense of putting the sidewalks in, and then they're still going to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| the $110,000 in bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| So that's, and if they retain them, they're not going to put the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Help me understand how they couldn't be ADA when you were first grading the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| There's a 15% grade on the backside of one of the roads, and when the driveways, if a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| driveway is cut in, then it automatically does away with the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| When you've got a 15% grade, you can't put sidewalks in driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| They don't match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| So that's why it was just never feasible to put sidewalks in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| And once I went, once I found out that even if I put them in, that they were not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| to release the bond, that's when I decided not to put the sidewalks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| At that point in time, when you realized you couldn't meet ADA, did you talk with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| or have any discussion about maybe getting a variance or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| No, that was many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I mean, that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Yeah, but at that time, did you not look to do that, take some type of proactive measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| to eliminate that requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| Well, I didn't know what process to go through to eliminate it, and that's one this is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| up now because of the bond renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| I think, Madam Chair, I think I agree with most of everything the commissioners, fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| commissioners have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| I just want to say we probably don't have the right to say anything other than to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| but if we can influence, I would certainly say that the folks that live in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| ought to have the first seat at the table with the county to figure out a way to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| And if it's a bad idea, you know, I think they should have a heavy say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| If they want this green line here, I don't see any sidewalk here that would exceed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| bond amount based on the lineal square footage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| So, we've got a $60,000 bond, $110,000, whatever it was, that was a promise made to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| the sidewalks, and I think that those residents deserve to work something out with you folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| and I hope that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| Mr. Snowden, you know, typically, my understanding, bonds are specific to a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| And have you checked with Nock County Legal to see if those funds can be used outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| the site for a sidewalk along Pleasant Ridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| We haven't, because under this arrangement, we wouldn't be necessarily capturing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| bond to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| He would be using his resources to do it, so we wouldn't, you're exactly right, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| think we could foreclose the bond to do the work off-site, but under this arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| that was proposed, we felt like that was a different scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| So you would ask that he provide you with the funding up front, and then once that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| resolved, then the planning commission could deny the sidewalks in the subdivision, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| What the proposal was, Mr. Phillips, is we would require him to build the sidewalks per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| whichever plan, I mean, our suggestion or their suggestion or a combination of the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| and then once that plan was implemented, then we would release the bond that we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| hold at $110,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| And obviously that $110,000, I went back and looked, this subdivision was platted in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| so that bond's 14 years old, so that's probably one of the reasons why it is quite a bit less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| than what it probably should be in today's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| And I agree with everything that Commissioner Hill mentioned, that the residents ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| be first to benefit from this, whatever way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| I'm going to make a motion to deny the applicant's request to eliminate sidewalk requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| condition of the concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips to deny the request, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| We do still have some lights on, I want to hear from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| I just wanted to ask, Mr. Ware had indicated, or he said that we would have to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| the requirement for sidewalks in order to be able to use to make this new sidewalk happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| I was going to ask Mr. Snowden, is that the way that will play out at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5609)|
| 1:33:38| If you don't care, Scott, could you state the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| I'm not sure if I told you what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Mr. Ware had indicated that in order to use, to make this new sidewalk occur, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| need to eliminate the requirement for sidewalks from the old plan to, I guess, free that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5629)|
| 1:34:01| That's what Mr. Ware said, and I'm just asking, is that what eventually we will need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5641)|
| 1:34:07| Yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| To Mr. Ware's point, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| And to Mr. Graff's point, I don't, I think I would like to take ownership, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| inspection staff didn't do a very good job here, I'll admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| We did make some of the lots be graded down to allow four driveway connections, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| we've got a subdivision out there that we physically cannot build ADA compliant sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| You just cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| There are driveway profiles that we may not be able to get the driveways tied back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| the garages, and would have significant issues like retaining walls and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| that are in home sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| So it's a tough spot, no question, but what our proposal was, was for Mr. Ware to, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| this body to release the requirement for sidewalk in his subdivision so that we could build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| them offsite at a location that could be used by more people as a public at large benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| and eliminate a mid-block crossing that we get complaints on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| So that was our logic behind it, but I do admit our department made mistakes, no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| I guess that's what I'm kind of getting at, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| This is not necessarily the applicant saying, eliminate this condition so I'm off the hook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| and he gets his bond back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| This is you guys together saying, we think we have a way to utilize this situation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| improve the community, so is that, you're both asking for this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| And that's what we felt like was, that's a good way to categorize what we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Commissioner Graff, your light was on, I just wanted to make sure that it didn't get turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| off by mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| No, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| Oh, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| Yeah, that, the fact that they're not going to foreclose on the bond, that kind of makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| a whole, that makes it a different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| The bond money can only be used for sidewalk, but if the developer is actually going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| build a sidewalk outside of the subdivision, then the residents of that subdivision could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5773)|
| 1:36:24| ask that some amenity be built inside other than sidewalks, since that money is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| I mean, technically should have been used inside their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| So that means the bond money may only be able to be used for sidewalks, but the developer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| money can be used for any kind of amenity, which brings me right back to what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| Hill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| I think that the people, the residents of this subdivision need to have the first seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| They need, they're the ones that through whatever fault, whether it be cannot do it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| of grade, whatever, they're the ones who were promised an amenity and did not get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| I think that the city of Knoxville, city engineering, county engineering, the developer, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| residents should all sit down and say, okay, this is how much money we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5835)|
| 1:37:21| This is, where is the best place to put this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| And I think county engineering and the developer working together to resolve this, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| I understand you can't build the sidewalks, and I'm not wanting, I don't want to see Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| Ware drug through a, you know, a bed of coals either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| I think there, somewhere there's an amicable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| I think at first we assumed that it had to be spent on sidewalks, but if you're not foreclosing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| on the bond and there's money that can be used somewhere else, let's let the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| of Spradlin Place and city engineering and county engineering and the developer all sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| down together and come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| At that point, I think, could we, I mean, could they bring it back to us without an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| additional fee and let us make a decision on, at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| If we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| If we deny, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Well, Mr. King had also requested a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| And I don't know how long it would take to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| I need a point for Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| Go ahead, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| If this is active on, say it's denied today, is the one year period for bringing it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5918)|
| 1:38:47| applied to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| I'm still in the posture of suggesting that since all of these issues have been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5932)|
| 1:39:01| that we have a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Still suggesting postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| We still have some lights on, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| And to that end, can we get a resolution to this done in 30, 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| Is that something that's possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| Given all of the potential parties to be involved, I'd say 60 days would be the better thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5957)|
| 1:39:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| There is, but we still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| And you, Commissioner Phillips actually had made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| And you had seconded, but I'd like to hear from the other commissioners before we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| any changes to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| I have a question about the motion that's currently on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| The staff recommendation was a two-part recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| The first part was to deny the request to eliminate the sidewalks, but the second part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| was to approve a revised sidewalk condition of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| Do we still need, if we go forward with a denial, do we still need the second part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| I think having a second part that, while not identifying what the sidewalk resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| is, but a condition that there be some resolution to the sidewalk requirement would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6021)|
| 1:40:29| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| I was tracking the same way as Commissioner Eason that I don't want to just deny the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| because he still is going to have the obligation to put the sidewalks in subdivision and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| I think the more prudent thing is to try to get specific enough today to deny the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| piece and approve, to her point, the second piece saying that they have to work out something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| to spend $110,000 with the approval of Knox County Engineering, City Engineering, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| the residents of Spratlin Place, and that would be very complicated, or we can postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| it 60 days and let them come back and Mr. Snowden is smiling at me and assuring me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| they can work something out in that 60 days, and the city is inside Knox County, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| sure that if you get the dollars back, it's almost like free bucks for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| You didn't have it coming to you anyway, so if you had to hand it over to the city, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| not going to hurt Mayor Jacobs' budget, so I would sure hope that we would amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6087)|
| 1:41:35| motion or deny the first one that's on the floor and try to postpone it and get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| done, because I think that we've got the pressure on them right now to get an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| and get the money spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| I think, thank you Madam Chair, I think I'd be more inclined to postpone it, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6108)|
| 1:41:59| I would be inclined to deny it as well, because I'm hearing that we can't, what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| is that we can't, there can't be sidewalks put in now where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| This plat was approved before any construction ever started with sidewalks, and it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| I don't, I don't think there's any stretch that would allow us to just say, okay, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| don't have to put it in now because you can't meet ADA requirements, because that was one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| of the requirements to start with and we, and just for whatever reason, I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| think we can allow developers to say, well, I'm just not going to do it in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| of the project and then come back later and say we can't put them in because they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| meet ADA rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| But I would be, but I am for, to postpone this thing for 60 days and see if the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| and the residents and the developer can come up with a, with a reasonable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I'm thinking the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| I would probably vote against the motion that's out there right now, hoping to get a, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| a 60 day postponement, because I think it's kind of, it's got light on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6188)|
| 1:43:13| We're got a little momentum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| Maybe these guys can work this out and in 60 days, we'll be able to get a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| If the proposer and the seconder are amenable to it, they could withdraw that first motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| but that's up to them, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| We're working, we're working our way down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| I think I made the motion correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| You did make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| I will amend my motion, withdraw the denial and ask for a 60 day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| And I'll amend my second, but I would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| You may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Just one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| You're next on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| So the motion by Commissioner Phillips has been amended to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Commissioner Clancy already seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Oh, he already did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| He amended his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| And Commissioner Clancy, you are next on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Just, just so we're clear, and this will speak to Jeff's objection, we'll get in 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6247)|
| 1:44:18| we're hoping they're going to come up with a amicable solution to this whole thing where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| But the very first thing we're going to do is deny the applicant's request to eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| It's still going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| We'll have to vote to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| Then we'll have to vote to approve their resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| So it's going to have, that, that release, us denying their, his request releases the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| bond and, and lets that go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| So we'll still have to deny, even if, even with an amicable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| We'll still, we'll still have to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| When it comes in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Deny what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| His, his, his request to eliminate the sidewalk requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| We'll work up something for you for that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| We'll address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Yeah, I would hope when it comes back to us that it would benefit the people in Spradling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6307)|
| 1:45:18| and not be used for any offsite improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| That's not part of the motion, but that's my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| I just want to say that I understand the denial, but I don't think this is the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| I don't want to let them off until we have a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| Currently, we have a motion on the floor to postpone for 60 days made by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| I see, except for Commissioner Clancy still has his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| And we'll see you guys in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6362)|
| 1:46:13| Next on our agenda is item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| The subdivision is Meredith Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| The applicant developer is Cannon and Cooper's LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| The location is the east side of Bishop Road at Tate Trotter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| The approximate acreage is 5.56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| The proposed use is attached and detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| The number of lots is 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Subdivision, there are one, two, three subdivision variances required, and there are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6414)|
| 1:47:06| waivers requiring Planning Commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6426)|
| 1:47:17| We lost several commissioners and our advising attorney, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| I would say that let's take a 15-minute recess, 10-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| How about 13 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| We'll reconvene at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| No, I just want 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| We're going to go ahead and get started again with agenda item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6460)|
| 1:47:49| The subdivision is Meredith Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| The applicant developer is Cannon and Cooper's LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6472)|

| 1:48:22| There are, this is where I was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| There was our three variances requiring Planning Commission approval, a waiver requiring Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6505)|
| 1:48:34| Commission approval, and a waiver approved by the Knox County Department of Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Staff recommendation is to approve variances one through three and waiver one because topographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| constraints and site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations and the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| Also to approve the request for up to 25 detached and attached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| and a reduction of the periphery setback to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| There is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| Sir, do you have anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| I'm Garrett Tucker, 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville, and first of all, I just want to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| all for your time that it takes to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| But since we weren't on consent, I know there was one question, one concerned neighbor about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| some flooding and I talked to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| They put a larger pipe under Bishop Road a few years ago, so that should address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| Of course, we're going to maintain a stream buffer and build an extension pond and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| that the stormwater ordinance requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| The interesting thing about this was the cemetery and we still have that condition on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| and everybody that we have talked to, there were some graves over in Mendenhall Estates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| that we did about 15 years ago, which this was all one property way back in 200 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| It was a 685-acre tract that went with the bail property, so it's very likely that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| graves over in Mendenhall were the curved cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| From three different people, that's the report that we have gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| We also understand that the owners of the lots over in Mendenhall had those graves relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6635)|
| 1:50:44| We reconsider having to do the archaeology investigation and looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6644)|
| 1:50:51| I've been out there and spent several hours on the property myself and can't see anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| but we are talking with an archaeologist and looking at doing that, but I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| that could be discussed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| I'm going to call on Commissioner Goodwin, who is our resident archaeologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| What I know is that given that piece of property, I haven't seen it, so I don't know specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| but if there are graves in the area where some people have suggested, it wouldn't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6677)|
| 1:51:26| but a few hours at most for an archaeologist, trained archaeologist, to find out whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| there were graves there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6692)|
| 1:51:35| If there are not, no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| So I would be a little reluctant to release that requirement, but it's not going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| very much to get someone out there to look at it very quickly and determine quickly whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6706)|
| 1:51:53| there's anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Is there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| Yes, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Commissioner Graf, could you pull down your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| I'd like to hear what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| I have a few questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| The first is the reduction of the intersection spacing from 300 feet down to 190 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6735)|
| 1:52:27| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| The other is the 22-foot-wide paving width on the streets and the 15-mile-an-hour speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6748)|
| 1:52:42| limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| And I think that ties in with the fact that you've got a 22-foot-wide street, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6763)|
| 1:52:54| too narrow for off-street parking, which there is no provision for, and you're calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| for centralized mailboxes on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6782)|
| 1:53:10| There are no sidewalks provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| How do you get from your home to the mailbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| I guess you walk in a 25-foot-wide street that allows parking on both sides if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6799)|
| 1:53:28| It just seems to me that this doesn't, it's just too much and too small a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6808)|
| 1:53:41| If you're going to walk in the street, then the street ought to be at least 26 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| If you're not, then you should have a sidewalk somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| If you're going to put the mailboxes centralized, if you come home from work and you stop at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6832)|
| 1:54:00| the mailbox, you're blocking traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| I mean, this, I know it's a plan and I'm not arguing the density or anything, I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6843)|
| 1:54:13| think it works very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| I'm going to call on planning staff, Taryn Barrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| So the reasoning for the location of the driveway as where it is for the property is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6862)|
| 1:54:30| sure it maintains the appropriate sight distance of 300 feet for a 30-mile-per-hour road of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| Bishop Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| So the engineer for the project has certified that it does meet the sight distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| of 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6883)|
| 1:54:48| The intersection spacing is for a Tate Trotter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| So the intersection spacing is for a collector road, which Bishop Road is a collector road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| and so for collector's roads, you have to maintain 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| So the distance between the proposed access and the center line for Tate Trotter is 190| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6904)|
| 1:55:11| feet currently where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| And so in order to maintain that sight distance for where it's located on the property, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| sight distance of 300 feet in each location, north and south, you have to be able to locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| it at that position to maintain a safe sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| I understand that, but what's that have to do with being too close to the intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| I'm sorry, Commissioner Graf, could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I understand what she's saying about sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| What I don't understand is what does that have to do with being too close to the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6943)|
| 1:55:52| which is 190 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| I'm not following what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| The only amount of frontage that they have that's available according to where they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| come out at a reasonable grade allows them to only go at the south side of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| I mean, the engineer can talk to more of that, Gary, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| Yeah, if we moved it to that far, you know, the south end of the property, you wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| have the required sight distance, and you would be going, the topography's worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| So what we were doing, it was putting the driveway at the most favorable location for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| sight distance due to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| And again, the 15-mile-an-hour speed limit, it's also due, it's for sight distance within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| the development so that you can see around, you know, as you're driving through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| And it's such a small site, you don't need to be driving that fast anyway, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| I understand all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| And what I'm saying is, I think we've got too much there for the site and the constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7015)|
| 1:57:04| of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| I'm not quite, if you get 25 units in there, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| But I don't think we've done it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| We, you, the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| You know, and it's, this size of a parcel is, becomes difficult to develop, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7038)|
| 1:57:28| you start putting more than one cul-de-sac in there, then all you have is cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| And so, you know, we were trying to be creative and trying to come up with some ways that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| and I think it will flow pretty well, actually, in the loop road around the end where we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| got the common areas where we're planning on putting the centralized mail system so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| people can, you know, as they loop around there, it gives you an alternate access through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| So I think it fits the site and the parcel, you know, the shape of the parcel, with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7076)|
| 1:58:03| the constraints that we have, I think it's the best place we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| Why wouldn't you have a 26-foot wide street in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| Well, you only got 25 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| Well, I didn't feel like it needed to be private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| Or a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| I don't, we weren't asked to do sidewalks, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| I know you weren't asked to do them, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| I don't think that they're necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| We disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Are these units going to have two-car garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| Okay, so there won't be on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7118)|
| 1:58:43| Everybody will have a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| I just, I think one of the benefits of the narrow road is people don't drive very fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| on really narrow streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| And so it's a very, the road width to me is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| The size, I think it kind of fits with the size, a lot of these units are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7136)|
| 1:59:03| I'm okay with the variance on the intersection because it accomplishes site distance, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7143)|
| 1:59:09| to me is really important for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| So I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I think it's, I think it looks pretty good, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| Am I hearing a motion out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7160)|
| 1:59:21| I'll make a motion that we approve variances one through three and waiver one because topographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| constraints and site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations and the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| one through three and waiver one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| Okay, we have one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| I make a motion we approve the request for up to 25 detached and attached dwellings on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| individual lots and a reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7206)|

| 2:00:11| request for, to approve the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7211)|

| 2:00:17| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7218)|

| 2:00:20| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| We have one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| We are on to agenda item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| This is subdivision Pittman Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| The applicant developer is Jim Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| The location is south side of Buttermilk Road, east of Graybeal Road, west of Marietta Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Approximate acreage is 26.84 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| The proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| The number of lots is 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| There is two variances required by planning commission, one variance, one waiver requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| planning commission approval, and there is an approved waiver by the Knox County Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| The staff, oh, and there's two waivers approved, already approved by Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| The staff recommendation is to approve variances one and two and waiver one because the site's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| topography and shape restrict compliance with subdivision regulations and the proposed variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7300)|
| 2:01:47| and waiver will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| To approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions and to approve the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7312)|
| 2:01:58| plan for up to 70 detached residential dwellings on individual lots subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| So that is three motions, three votes, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7325)|
| 2:02:13| Three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| Concept plan and development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| Applicant, would you like to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| I saw several hands go up, are you all going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| We worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| So you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| Yes, total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I'm John Tasic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| I live at 12320 Pittman Drive, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| The point that I'm interested in making is the realities of dumping 70 or possibly 113| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7364)|
| 2:02:54| housing units onto Pittman Road, which is a 10 to 12 foot wide paved road, has no lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7374)|
| 2:03:05| markings, has no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| It's restricted, Knox County school bus system is not allowed to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7390)|
| 2:03:18| All of the residents have to slow down to meet oncoming traffic and the closure of Pittman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7398)|
| 2:03:28| at any point, restricting access to the current residents, would create additional hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| in addition to the traffic safety issues of putting that much traffic onto what was an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7413)|
| 2:03:42| old logging trail many years ago and has never been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| I yield the remainder of my time to Manuela.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| Have you already written down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| We were the first ones here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| My name is Manuela Tasic, it's P-T-A-C-E-K, I'm at 12320 Pittman as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| My husband neglected, and I'll let you guys know that he sent you an email, which we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| not sure if you have reviewed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| We have been at our home for 18 and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| 1950, that area of the road was gravel, and that's when they came out and threw some black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| top on it, and it's never been improved ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| There are two blind hills, three blind curves, UPS has had wrecks out there, and buses, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| now as my husband said, the bus system is not allowing any transit on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| Vulcan is expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| There is a sinkhole on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| That area coming into Pittman, we have deer, we have eagle nest out there, we have horses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7482)|
| 2:04:48| that cross that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| It is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| Don't be believing that people know it's a narrow road so they slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| They don't, and they use that road as a crossways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| We have a tree and a large boulder in front of our home, and we're at the base of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| of those blind hills, and we have had our tree hit numerous times, and we have had our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| boulder hit because someone was coming out of a driveway, and they freak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| In addition to that, I'm going to try to stay really quickly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| We received no notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| The mail issue is dangerous, and I have nearly gotten hit numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| I park in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| I turn my flashers on just so I can quickly get to my mailbox because you cannot walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| across there at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| It is also a low volume road, and my concern is that when they come down the street on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7530)|
| 2:05:37| that side into Pittman, if they're drunk or inebriated in any fashion, they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7537)|
| 2:05:43| to run into Larry's property, his home, his driveway, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| It's a straight shot into their driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| If you think of 70 houses and two cars per home, we have four kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| At one point, we had six cars in our driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| So even if you're looking at three cars, you're talking 339 cars, and they're going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| down there, and they're going to shoot out, usually out to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| I would recommend that you guys respect the residents' needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| Come out and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Hang out in my front yard and see the best interest of us and not developers who will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| not be living in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| I reserve to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| I've not signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| Zach Shanley, 12504 Buttermilk Road, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7589)|
| 2:06:34| So I looked at the subdivision report, and I'll be quick, I don't have a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| and a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| At one, we had mentioned there's 26.84 acres of land, 70 homes with an expansion of 43| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7600)|
| 2:06:46| to 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Well, that comes out to be 2.6 if they only do 70 and 4.19 houses per acre on 2.5 approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7607)|
| 2:06:56| land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| So either way, they're over the 2.5 approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| Furthermore, there's not a lot of people here from Buttermilk because a sign was never posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| at the top of the development on the road, which per the sign on the released report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| should have been there because it's the more busy road, as we've mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| So nobody in our neighborhood really knows that that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| I'll add that this is one of about seven or eight developments within about a one and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| a half to two mile radius to a school that already has taken music teachers and art teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| out of the room and put them on carts in the hallway, an academy that has a science class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| now in the auditorium because it's the only place that fits that many kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| Kids are leaving the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| The roads can't handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7653)|
| 2:07:34| Eighteen foot wide roads, multiple accidents, milk cart just got hit the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| Neighborhood got rear-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| So that's just some of the ones, but I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| With the applicant, oh, is there one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| He's been sitting there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| My name is Larry Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| I live at 12416 Pitman Drive and 12420 Pitman Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| I have 20 acres right where this is going in, and I have nothing against building houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7685)|
| 2:08:12| As a matter of fact, I own that land at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| My family moved down there in the 50s, and we've had five generations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7695)|
| 2:08:22| And since the 50s, that road has not been improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| Pitman Road is just like it was except with pavement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7706)|
| 2:08:32| It was gravel when we moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Now, my wife is a camper, and she has a little camper that she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7715)|
| 2:08:42| She goes on her own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| But in order to be safe, I have to go to the end of the road and stop all traffic for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| to get a little camper down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| It's only 12-foot to 16-foot width road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| And right on the road, over the years, well, when we had a farm there, we had a barbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| wire fence, and the birds planted a bunch of cedar trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7746)|
| 2:09:14| So you can't get over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| There's no shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| So if a two-pickup truck Mr. Bryant, I do want to let you know your time is up, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| we'd like to hear you, if you'd just condense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Well, all I wanted to add is the road needs improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| Nothing against the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| It's just the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| But could I mention one other thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| Where they want to come across to come on to Pitman Road, if you look at the map, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| a huge pond there, and the pond, a creek flows through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7781)|
| 2:09:49| And when it rains real hard, the guy that owns the cattle on that side, it floods, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| he's got big rocks right into where that right-of-way is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| And it's like Niagara Falls right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| Plus, we had a pond in the 1950s, and it's a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| So we drained the pond, and now it's a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| So they would have to have EPA approval to come on to Pitman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| So that's all I got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| Thank you, Mr. Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| The sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| The sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Up there where he's building, too, there's a big sinkhole that opened up in the 1970s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| and we had to fence it off, and we throwed our dead cattle down in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| It was a huge sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| And that kind of went down into our groundwater, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| Four floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| And one day, it just sealed back up, but it's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| And the quarry can come within 10-foot, Vulcan, within 10-foot of where they're going to build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7852)|
| 2:11:01| They have approval already to come across Graybill, and right there within just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| feet of the houses, it's a huge rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| So it's a cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7875)|
| 2:11:16| Cattle cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| And I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| I've owned this property, I think, since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| And the entrance is proposed to come off of Buttermilk Road, not Pitman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| We will not have access to Pitman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| The 50-foot right-of-way that comes down to Pitman Road was there when I sold off the five-acre track on the north end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7904)|
| 2:11:53| I had to maintain legal access to a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| That's the only reason that strip is down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| But we do not intend to utilize Pitman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| We will not have access and or an entrance on Pitman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| And what about sinkholes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| What about the sinkhole in the, what is it, the animal cemetery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| The sinkhole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| I didn't know there was a cemetery on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Well, in Knox County, it's very difficult to find a piece of property that does not have a potential sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| We deal with that on every piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| And that's what we deal with with engineering and our geotechs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| And so that will be dealt with through engineering and through the geotech folks that are smarter than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| I see this on your concept plan where you do have it identified and there are no homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7958)|
| 2:12:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| It looks like maybe just a cul-de-sac?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| Yeah, we have not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7969)|
| 2:12:50| Until we come in and spend money on the geotech, we don't know yet whether that's technically a sinkhole or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7970)|
| 2:12:56| And we have not done the geological work to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| So that's why we've left that presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| So the concept plan that we're looking at here that is 70 houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| So there may be additional houses that are put into this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| Possibly, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| We had Commissioner Roth's slide was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| And Scott just cleared it up that the plan I was looking at and everybody here that I heard speak against this was worried about Pittman Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8006)|
| 2:13:38| and there is no access to Pittman Road in the way this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| If we approve this today, it would be approved and there is no access to Pittman Road on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| I have no problem at all even stating publicly on the record that no one in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8030)|
| 2:13:56| even the home there at the end of the cul-de-sac, no one will have access to Pittman Road from the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| Sir, sir, we can't hear you from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| I think that you guys were out of time, but if you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| Just for clarification, my concerns and all my comments about sight lines, widths, and all that were buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| If I didn't, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8065)|
| 2:14:30| Commissioner Roth, were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Yes, I was just confused with all the objections from the Pittman Road people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| The concept plan I'm looking at doesn't connect to Pittman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| And I understand the gentleman's remarks about buttermilk, but nothing on Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8086)|
| 2:14:56| I didn't get that far and I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| Can I add that the signs are on Pittman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| The signs weren't on buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| The signs were on Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| You've got plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| That's what I was trying to say earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| I wasn't clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| The signs for the subdivision for this were posted on Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| Only on Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Only on Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Buttermilk never had the sign, so nobody up there knows about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| I only got it because I was one of four people on buttermilk that got a postcard sent to me that I got around New Year's this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8126)|
| 2:15:34| So that's what nobody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| Everybody on Pittman, that's where the sign was for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| It was improperly posted per the requirements that are in the report that are on the NOC Shiny website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8146)|
| 2:15:48| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| I was wondering about the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| 26.92, it is two and a half to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| At one point, and I'll try to answer and then defer to Mr. Davis, but at one point Mr. Davis owned all this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8167)|
| 2:16:16| It was about 73, and if I state something wrong, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8176)|
| 2:16:22| It's 73.56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| That total density for that entire property was allocated to the 73.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| He sold off some that has a reduced density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| So because the 73.5 acres had two and a half units per acre, that yielded approximately 180 units on the entire parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8192)|
| 2:16:43| Some of those have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| Others are allocated to other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| The planned residential allows the dispersal or concentration of the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8207)|
| 2:16:55| So as long as on that 73.56 acres there is not more than approximately 180 units, within that 73.56 acres on separate parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8215)|
| 2:17:05| the density can be increased or reduced above or below 2.5 as long as the average for the 73.56 is 2.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8225)|
| 2:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| So the additional lots that he's not showing now will still fall into the two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8236)|
| 2:17:24| Or on the property to the southeast of this and up to the north, sort of northwest, those five lots are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8244)|
| 2:17:36| So all this property at one time was one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| 2.5 acres per acre on that 73 acres is divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| It's been parceled out among the quarter now, I think, seven or eight different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| This piece will probably build out, what, around four to the acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| Yeah, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| Yeah, it depends on the analysis on the sinkhole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| But originally we had 73.56 acres that were zoned 2.5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| And we sold off different pieces, and one of which was developed right at about one unit an acre and another piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| They just decided to put one home on the entire track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| And so this is the remaining parcel there, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| So there's potentially more homes that would be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8300)|
| 2:18:23| The total yield, probably close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| I'd have to do the calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| But it's going to be determined about the sinkhole area in the middle and what the geologist tells us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8308)|
| 2:18:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| It just didn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| Oh, no, that's a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8321)|
| 2:18:42| Are all the objections voiced today regarding Pitman Road, do they transfer equally to Buttermilk Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8322)|
| 2:18:49| I mean, does Buttermilk Road have all these issues with, you know, boulders and trees and flooding and sinkholes and potential drivers and all those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8329)|
| 2:19:02| Or is this just a misplacement of the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| The potential drunk drivers are everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| Oh, yeah, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| So, yes, Buttermilk Road is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| It is a little wider than Pitman, but the traffic is probably, if you were to take the traffic versus the road width, Buttermilk is worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8350)|
| 2:19:20| Especially if you go towards Watt Road, I think it would be west, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| There's an S-curve that you really have to slow down, and you have a cliff on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| It's probably not a cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| It's probably about an 80-degree angle down about 30 feet, and if you don't slow down, you're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| You go the other way, you can't get down Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| It's got a hairpin right at 90 degrees, and it's the same width as the other side of Pitman, actually, or Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8380)|
| 2:19:49| Yeah, so Graybiel is just to your up a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8389)|
| 2:19:59| So if you ride through that S-curve right there, if you go through there, that whole side of that goes straight down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8399)|
| 2:20:06| There's no guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| There's no shoulder at all, and if you keep going this way as you come across it and go the other route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| what happens is the other outlet goes to Marietta Church, which floods every time it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| and it's a big snake as you go down, or you've got to go down the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| There's already two other subdivisions actually going in at the bottom of Marietta that this is going to come into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| not to mention the five that are now where Marietta hits Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| So from a traffic standpoint, you're totally locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| If you try to go the other way down Graybiel past the quarry, you do have to stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| but one car has to put their tires off the road for two cars to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| and there's only a couple spots you can do that because the trees are on the side of the road quite literally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| and they're right there, and that's the area that Vulcan is allowed to come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| So we are totally landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| There's been, like I said, there was an accident because a mail truck went to fill the mail truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| A car tried to go around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| It was a big truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| It swiped the side of it because it couldn't fit on buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| It couldn't fit around the mail truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| Had to bring another mail truck out, tow it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| We'd have to rent in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| My neighbor was rear-ended coming into her house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8474)|
| 2:21:17| Two of the waivers, it's a 15-degree slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| They're looking for entrance onto buttermilk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| and they're looking for a waiver to have no radiuses onto buttermilk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| and you can't see 300 feet left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| So on an individual basis, maybe those waivers aren't so bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| but you take the 15-degree slope, which earlier someone said you can't build sidewalks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| It's so steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| But all these buses are going to have to come up or kids are going to have to walk up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| No radius onto the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| Can't see left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| And it's probably, I think it's posted 35 miles an hour, and it's only 18 feet wide on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| I don't really think it's that wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| I've never put a tape measure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| So all these things together, I don't know how you're going to get cars, kids, buses, moving trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8513)|
| 2:22:00| I've seen moving trucks high center trying to take the turn onto those side streets onto buttermilk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8520)|
| 2:22:06| and it completely blocked the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| About a month ago, I had to go a long way around because I had to bring a wrecker in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| So the roads are just as bad, if not worse, up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| Mr. Breschke, do you have anything that you'd like to contribute to this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8536)|
| 2:22:24| One of the things on the traffic issue, with the number of laws we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| it does not, under the guidelines, require a transportation impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8550)|
| 2:22:36| At this point, there is a condition that any further development of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| for the potential 113 lots that are in a sense identified or numbered on the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8560)|
| 2:22:48| would require a transportation impact analysis to be done with any further development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8568)|
| 2:22:55| And that density number, when I put that in there, was based on this tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8575)|
| 2:23:02| and the piece along buttermilk, where those five lots are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| because one of the previous concepts included all this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8587)|
| 2:23:10| and those five lots there were actually identified as Unit 1 of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8590)|
| 2:23:16| So the 2.2 dwelling unit breaker was based on that tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| with the 70 additional lots that are being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8606)|
| 2:23:30| Didn't we just approve, just immediately east or west of this property, Houston Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| didn't they just go on Buttermilk Road, right on the other side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| like one of the last two meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| Is the road, was that road an issue for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8624)|
| 2:23:47| Because it's not far from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| I don't remember a lot of conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| I mean, I think we approved them for a concept plan based on three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| and it's probably 1,000 feet, 800 feet to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8641)|
| 2:24:13| Sir, we're not going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| Did you have a direct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| Yeah, just going to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| But we can't hear from the seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| That subdivision, yeah, it's further down that way, if you will, past all the S's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| and it's just up of the new sewage water treatment plant, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| that they're putting in, and it's a straight shot straight down to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| There's no houses down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| I shouldn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| There's like two or three other houses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| All of the population of Buttermilk is actually upwards of the blue to Marietta,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| because Vulcan owns the whole left side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| So there's no homes down where they're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| So the traffic from there drops off substantially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| and it's on the other side of the bad curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| It's hard for us to deny something, one property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| when we just approved kind of the same thing right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| It's going to have to have a very substantial difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| I mean, I don't know if I was saying reject, but the thing had eight conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| a lot of plans, do this, do this, do this, do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| and I know we're saying spread this all out, no school study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| but you already got schools that are in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| So I would maybe recommend, my recommendation was that we do these studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8721)|
| 2:25:28| maybe on an individual basis, all these subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| and all these homes aren't an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| But when you put 10, 12 into a community and never look at it as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| and waive all these studies, you end up with an issue that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| that we can't support anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| We're not waiving studies, as Mr. Bretschko pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| There is a standard for transportation impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| This does not meet that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| We don't have the authority to require something that doesn't meet that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| There is no requirement for school impact studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| The school system has told us over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| and talked to the planning commissioners that they can accommodate different traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| May I ask a question because I'm real hard of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| I've got my hearing aids in, but I couldn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| How many houses was the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| For transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| How many acres, I think that's what I heard, that they're planning on building on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8780)|
| 2:26:24| Was there 70-something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| No, the entire tract at one time was 73 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8786)|
| 2:26:29| And it's parceled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| Yeah, there's only 25 left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| I mean, the rest of it, part of it's a horse farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| And I sold the land to Scott Davis back in 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| So I know the land, and, you know, we're not against houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8805)|
| 2:26:50| We're just against the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| The houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| In the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| Really quick, really quick, one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Why did they call it Pittman Estates if they are not planning to come down on Pittman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| I have a question about the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| I understand that in 70 units you don't have to have it, but in 71 units you would, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| And I understand that staff can require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| I think we have heard that it takes quite a bit of effort to review traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8843)|
| 2:27:28| but it seems like, you know, clearly there's a cul-de-sac and there's space for additional units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| that it's cut off at 70 units for a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| I really feel like in this case the traffic impact analysis could be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| especially looking at this portion of Buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| But we could request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| I thought that I was of the impression from our last agenda review that that is something that is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8869)|
| 2:27:59| Is that already approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| Or is that approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| It just got approved on a consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| As of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| As of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8887)|
| 2:28:08| So can we do that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8888)|
| 2:28:12| Is it going to affect as soon as it is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| Steve, but it's also in coordination with Knox County Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8898)|
| 2:28:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| I'm sorry, I missed that part of the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| The administrative rules have been revised to enable the Planning Commission to require transportation impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8911)|
| 2:28:41| We do that in coordination with the engineering and public works, so we would need their support also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| The staff can require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| The commission can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| The commission can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| We can, in coordination with engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8931)|
| 2:28:56| I have another question also about utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| I think when we talked about that previous subdivision that was being put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| the utilities were being upgraded on that portion of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Are the utilities all in place on this portion of Buttermilk also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| I believe utilities are in place because I think the five lots up front there already have utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8956)|
| 2:29:31| We have no sewer up there off of Buttermilk at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| So you're just on septic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8974)|
| 2:29:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| Could you answer that, Scott, in terms of what your plans are for septic or sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8979)|
| 2:29:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8982)|
| 2:29:43| Buttermilk Road is probably, I would guess, 75 to 100 feet in elevation above Pittman, so everything comes down toward Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8983)|
| 2:29:53| There's sewer available on Everett Road, wherever it comes in and hits Yarnell, I think it is, whatever that road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=8993)|
| 2:30:00| So sewer will attach sewer into the new existing, where that new subdivision is there on Everett will attach sewer in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9000)|
| 2:30:08| Water, electric are available to the site on both Buttermilk and Pittman, and sewer just down below Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9008)|
| 2:30:16| And we obviously couldn't do that density without sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9016)|
| 2:30:23| Commissioner Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| Yeah, I think I've heard enough, and I think staff got it right, and so I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9025)|
| 2:30:37| We've got to approve the variances first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| Right, your variances first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| Okay, well then I would make a motion that we approve variances one and two and waiver one because the site's topography and shape restricts compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9041)|
| 2:30:49| and the proposed variances and waiver will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9052)|
| 2:30:54| Okay, you guys flip a coin because you both said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| We have a motion by Commissioner Eaton, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve variances one and two and waiver one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| I would normally take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| No, I wouldn't normally take it because we still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| Commissioner Roth, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9070)|
| 2:31:12| One question that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| I don't know that I think, I don't think we should, as the conversation went on with the traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9074)|
| 2:31:22| I don't think we should just ignore the fact that the 70 units don't require it, so I don't think we should require it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| But my question is, if they do, if Scott does come back and add the additional homes, does that automatically kick in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| Does he have to come back to this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| Yes, that's one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| But it has to come back to this commission for the addition of these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| So his plan has to come back here if he does any more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9106)|
| 2:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9114)|
| 2:31:55| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner, oh, that's Commissioner Eaton's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9115)|
| 2:32:04| Yeah, he's making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| I'm making the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| You're still good, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| We're going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| To approve the variances one and two and waiver one, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9133)|
