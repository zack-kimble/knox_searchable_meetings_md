| 0:00:06| Cana commission. We've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=6)|
| 0:00:09| public hearing on the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=9)|
| 0:00:12| agenda items. We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| take we're going to take them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=17)|
| 0:00:20| and we're going to do a roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=20)|
| 0:00:34| call. The first item is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=34)|
| 0:00:36| ordinance have been in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Knox County Charter to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=37)|
| 0:00:39| section 9.18 to Article nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=39)|
| 0:00:41| providing for the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=41)|
| 0:00:43| and administration of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| effective civil service merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| system for up for any or all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| Knox County employees in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| state of Knox County. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| order eight 1988 and amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| this is ordinance one zero one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| for second reading. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=57)|
| 0:01:01| public hearing. Everyone will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| get five minutes. Francis, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| want to go first? Yes, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Francis Ferguson, senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| director of human resources for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| Knox County government. I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| like to make a few comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| about civil service. First of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| all, I was born in the 1870s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| In today's era of professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| human resource management, civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| service isn't very commonly used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| by local governments. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Tennessee cities with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| populations greater than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| fifteen-thousand, we only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| four cities that use civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| service for general employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Among the ninety-five counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| CTAS confirms that we only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| one county that uses civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| service for their general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| employees. I have counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Nashville, metro Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Davidson in the city. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| only have five systems in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| county or in the state using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| for general employees. Civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| service is concerned really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| with only three things and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| is merit-based hiring, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| grievance process, and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| appeals process. And except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| written employment tests and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| termination restrictions, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| already have all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| elements in place. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| if you wanted to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| converting to a civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| system for Knox County, one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| the first things you'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| look at would be the staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| pattern. I met with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| civil service office and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| were very generous in sharing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| lot of their figures. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| budgeted thirteen full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| staff to administer their civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| service system. Now, they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| not administer benefits or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| wellness program. So those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| thirteen employees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| dedicated just to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| employment process. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| County's human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| department has twelve full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| employees. So it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| comparable until you realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| that four of our employees are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| dedicated to benefits and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| wellness, primarily our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| insurance function. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| leaves eight of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| who could fulfill similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| functions, leaving us five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| full-time employees shy. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| we wanted to use the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Knoxville as a model, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| need to add five full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| staff. There certainly are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| advantages to having civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| service. And the first would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| to have that merit-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| hiring. It certainly does end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| political patronage and it uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| hiring based upon an assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| of a candidate's knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| skills, and abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Employees under this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| enjoy a great deal of job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| security. And that job security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| basically is in the form of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| property rights that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| to that position. Once they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| pass the probationary period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| essentially they own their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| You certainly have much less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| turnover because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| property rights status. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| have very little turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| But on the other side, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| are some disadvantages. And one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| of those would be cost. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| could do this two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| ways. I'll give you both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| scenarios. One would be if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| set up an entirely separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| civil service office and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| operated the human resources as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| we have now, it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| $1.7 million annually for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| 13 employees that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| I have included in that some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| funds for some start-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| consultation for professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| services. If you add to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| $1 million we're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| spending on our three different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| budgets for human resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| the cost to operate a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| office would actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| $2.7 million per year. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| decidedly that's not the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| efficient way to do things. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| I think we can control costs a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| little bit if you take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| current human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| department and convert it to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| civil service system. You'd add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| those new five positions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| associated office space and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| expenses and some limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| professional consultation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| just an additional $750,000 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| year. Add that to the $1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| million for the base staff that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| we have right now, and you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| cut the cost a little bit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| just $1.75 million per year. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| the county commission would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| decide that they would like for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| us to totally redo our existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| compensation system and our job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| descriptions, we would need an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| additional $400,000 for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| professional consultants or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| $2.15 million. A couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| things I have not included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| those costs, and that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| city budgets $50,000 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| for hearings for the grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| and appeals. They do not use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| the law department. They hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| an outside hearing officer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| a court reporter, and the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| of a hearing is between $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| and $15,000 per hearing. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| under our personnel board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| system, we don't have costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| associated with that. We'd also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| need a dedicated testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| facility that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| right now. Somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| city county building, a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| that we could furnish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| accommodate about 50 persons to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| administer proctored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| examinations. There have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| times, although it doesn't occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| very often, but there have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| several times when we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| position advertised that's had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| as many as 150 applicants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| administer 150 tests at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| same time. I assume we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| rent space someplace like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Civic Coliseum for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Then we'd have the cost of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| employment examinations, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| honestly don't have any figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| for that right now, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| certainly would have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| concerned that we had validated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| exams. So I think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| cheapest would be $1.8 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| plus the cost of that testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| facility plus the cost of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| examinations. A couple other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| disadvantages that I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| need to keep in mind, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| is the increased time it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| take to fill vacancies. Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| now under our system, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| fill a position vacancy in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| about six weeks. The city tells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| me that under the civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| system it would be three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| If you expedite it, you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| it in two and a half months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| which Vicky indicated that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| simply can't shorten it beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| that. Hiring supervisors would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| have fewer candidates to select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| from. They would receive a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| verified list of three or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| candidates, and must provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| some type of merit-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| justification for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| selection. If they don't choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| anybody from among those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| persons, then that three-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| hiring process or advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| process starts again. And you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| have some other disadvantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| such as reduced flexibility in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| changing job descriptions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| some concerns about whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| not pay increases are based upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| performance or just limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| longevity. I guess in summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| what I'd like to say to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| body is that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| about 90 percent of what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| you're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| And the question for me is, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| it really a good investment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| put this much money into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| something where you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| gain a little? I mean, are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| really willing to pay a lot to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| gain a little? We haven't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| begun to discuss the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| time it would take to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| something like this in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| and I'm a little bit concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| about, with my existing staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| the amount of overtime that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| would involve. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| probably beyond cost, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| biggest concern about this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| idea is I haven't seen the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| assessment. I'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| anyone on this body has yet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| conduct a needs assessment. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| the world of professional human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| resource management, you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| implement a time-consuming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| expensive project like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| without first determining that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| need exists. You know, if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| interested in conducting a needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| assessment, you know, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| strongly urge you to review the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| policies and procedures that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| in place in all of the affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| offices. If you want a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| start, go to the HR audit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Rotifer Moss did just last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| and take a look and see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| deficiencies they found in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| offices. In conclusion, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| just urge you to study it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| carefully, understand how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| money and how much time this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| going to cost, and understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| that there will be a downside to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| this. While there is that great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| advantage of absolutely assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| merit-based hiring, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| some disadvantages that go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| it as well. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| Commissioner Lambert? Yes. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| understand that there would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| cost associated with this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| wonder whether it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| quite as much as you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| suggesting. The city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| considerably more employees than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| we do. When you take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| effect that all of our lot, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| don't have a fire service, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| don't have a fireman on civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| service. We also, for the sake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| of civil service, don't have law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| enforcement on that because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| have their own merit system. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| while you're throwing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| numbers, those numbers are based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| on a much larger pool of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Now, if there's a cheaper way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| achieve what we're looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| here, I'm all for it. But, ma'am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| from being involved in county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| government over these last two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| years, very turbulent years, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| I see up here is I see a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| scared employees. They're afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| of losing their jobs whenever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| boss changes, so to speak. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| this government, when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| government is reconstituted after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| the next election, will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| changed five times in a two-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| period. That creates stress on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| these employees. Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| cheaper way? And I can't count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| the number of people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| called me and said that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| dismissed and felt like they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| dismissed for political reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Now, whether they were dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| for political reasons or not, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| can't assess that because all I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| know is what they're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| But there needs to be some appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| process. I also can't count the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| number of times that a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| employee has stepped up to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| microphone and they've made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| statement on one issue or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| another, and then the rumor ran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| rampant, they really don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| believe that way, but they had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| say what they said because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| might lose their job if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| don't. Now, I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| they're going to lose their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| if they don't. Now, I am tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| of being in a climate of fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| where people are afraid of losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| their jobs. Is there a cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| way to have some sort of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| appeal process so that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| that when a county employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| steps up to that microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| that they're telling the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| and they're not telling what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| political office holder has told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| them to say? Is there an easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| way to know that when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| county employee is dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| that it hasn't been for political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| reasons and that it was for true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| merit reasons? Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| cheaper way to have an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| process so that these hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| working folks that do the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| job in this government, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| we sit up here and run our mouths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| and have a good time, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| know what? We could disappear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| and the county probably wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| miss us for a month or two, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| the folks that are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| out there in the trenches that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| are doing the job, that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| keeping the roads paved, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| are emptying the trash bins at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| the convenience centers, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| they're off for a single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| the public knows instantly that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| they've got a problem with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| government. Is there any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| that we can give them security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| without such a high price tag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| And I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| In the climate that we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| you're throwing out numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| that sound high to me, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| wonder, now this is probably not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| the case, but I wonder whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| you're telling me what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| believe or whether an elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| official that opposes civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| service has told you to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I assure you that no elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| official worked on these notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| That rumor has not flown through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| the courthouse, but I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| create a system to where I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| that no one's job has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| threatened when they step up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Okay. I think you've asked two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| questions in there. One, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| talked about numbers of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| and that the city perhaps was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| administering this system to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| larger group of employees. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| you take, and I ran the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| at 8 o'clock this morning, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| were 2,868 full and part-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| employees. That does not include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| the Register of Deeds. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| remove the 1,008 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| that belong to the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Department, we still have over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| 1,800 employees. So I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| are talking about comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| systems. In terms of, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| a cheaper way to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| appeals process for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| such as convenience operators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| or highways? We have that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| This body worked for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| on populating the personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| board. We have that. We've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Then why are we still hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| rumors? Sir, that body is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| of the personnel plan for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| County. Not every elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| official is part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| They have the option to not take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| on our policies and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Can we do something to make all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| of them take on? It's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| understanding that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| number of agencies that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| It's my understanding that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| is a state law. I happen to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Tennessee County Government Handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| here in the personnel chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| indicates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| there shall be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| by the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| a set of personnel policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| in place. And you've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| We have a very thick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| very detailed, comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| set of personnel policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| It also says that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| county officials may, at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| description, have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| own policies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| procedures. And it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| that every single one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| has taken that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| option and has their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Now, do they have a grievance procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Do they have a personnel board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| or some type of hearing procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| they do. But I will tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| the standard Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| County personnel plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| has all of that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| the power as this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| to set up a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| review committee that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| hear grievances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| and override a firing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| That would be a law department question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Do we have that power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Not at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| What Ms. Fogerson is describing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| to you, several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| ago, the General Assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| passed a statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| as Francis describes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| that expected the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| commission to set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| personnel policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| The commission did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| You have quite an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| extensive personnel ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| in the Knox County Code. It's many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| pages. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| to that, there's also an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| handbook. But state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| and this is our proverbial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| debate. State law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| also allowed, as Francis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| points out, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| elected official to opt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| the personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| policies established by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| commission, which most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| if not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| other than the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| the elected officials did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| State law requires that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| elected officials have certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| minimum rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| to govern their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| concerning leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But it's pretty minimum. Now, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| the Sheriff's Department, by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| is a whole separate animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| The Sheriff's Department has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| a merit system council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| because they have certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| statutory requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| for hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| deputies for testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| for evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And then they have a merit system council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| that dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| back to the private acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| that governed Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| and that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| exists by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| there are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| big legal questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The reason we have prepared this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| as a charter amendment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| number one, the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| a civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| that would govern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| every elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| right now is contrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| But under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Jordan decision by the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Supreme Court, there is certainly a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| widely held belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| that as a charter county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Knox County could do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| things that other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| could not do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| That's why this is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| as a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| You will notice that the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| in this proposed charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| right now includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| all the elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| even the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| It does not, of course, include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| court clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Whether or not it can include the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| or ought to include the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| given the fact that the sheriff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| his own merit system council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| is a question to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| The other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| that this proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| charter amendment does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| and we prepared it as a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| and that way the voters would have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| to really decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| about this, you'll notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| at the bottom of page three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| it appears to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| state statute 82109| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| which gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| elected officials the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| to terminate their deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| I frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| don't know whether the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| by charter has the right to void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| that statute or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| This particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| charter amendment that we've put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| together for you is drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| from Shelby County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| which is the only other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| county that has a county wide civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| service system and of course as you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| they are a charter county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| are illegal issues about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| this particular proposed charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| that as I sit here today I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| that I can answer. I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| predict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| such a charter amendment really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| will in the long run be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| to govern all these elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| I'm certain some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| will have a view about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| and they will say under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| they're allowed to opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| and can Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| really gather them in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Others will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Knox County can't void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| the provisions of 82109.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| As a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| where my duty is to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| the county as employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I can tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| you that what this civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| service merit system is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| attempting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| it's attempting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| negate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| of employment at will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| I think it's important for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| on the commission to understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Tennessee law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| is an employment at will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| What this merit system does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| is it negates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| that for the employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| therefore Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| would no longer be an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| at will meaning Knox County could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| no longer just terminate someone because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Knox County thought it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| advisable to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| What this civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| does is it creates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| a property right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| in the employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| for the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| which may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| not be taken away from them in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| absence of due process of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| So what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| this would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| in some respects is it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| give the employer, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| less rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| give the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| more rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| and actually change Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| status as an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Now that may be what the commission wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| to do, that may be what the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| want to do in passing such an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| I think it's important for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| to understand those risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| under a civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| the employee obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| can challenge an employment decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| and they can then go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| chancery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Mary Ann, there is not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| there is one office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| in this courthouse that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| a county office that I have not heard a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| complaint about as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| unfair firings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| I have not heard a complaint about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| They have a merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| system where the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| feel like they have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| fair place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| see that their firings are not unjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| Every other office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| every other office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| I have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| complaints. I have heard complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| you know I think the citizens have sent a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| strong message to this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| that they're tired of business as usual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and I think part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| of reforming and part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| of cleaning up their act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| as an entity, as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| government is that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| take away the fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| of losing your job when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| work for this government and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| you know again it doesn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| through the civil service vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| but I'm looking for some vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| that will get us to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| where these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| can feel secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| and like I said I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| going to name names because I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| or specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| incidences because I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| know what I heard. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| can't assess that. That's where a merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| council or a civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| needs to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| judgment but every office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| except the sheriff's office which has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| merit system I've heard complaints on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| and I just think that's appalling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| have employees walk in the hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| scared to death. People right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| now, tax assessor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| any place where there's a contested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| election these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| are terrified because they wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| who's going to win and how's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| that going to affect my job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Something like civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| if civil service is too expensive I'm open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| to other ideas but something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| like civil service will put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| this sort of thing to arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Just for the record too I would like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| all to know there is a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| statute that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| says every and this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| govern statewide every county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| employee has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| right to talk to his or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| her county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| and the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| to come before the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| and there may be no retaliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| against that employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| for speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| his or her county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| or for coming before the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| commission. So there is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| anti-retaliation statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Frances, I don't know where this should be for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| the law director. First of all let me say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I haven't had the first person complain to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| but the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| government has what they call the EEOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Yes. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| it requires anybody before you can terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| anybody except people maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| the mayor or somebody is appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| like we were talking about right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| that's at their discretion when they come on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| but an employee before they can let anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| come don't they have to call them in and warn them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and document that so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| We have a progressive discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| system but there also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| is within our personnel policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| some instances in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| termination can be immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| But it almost has to be criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| There is a specific list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| I realize we have the year before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| they come on board and covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| I think we can let them go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| if they're here less than a year for no reason at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Well actually the only thing that's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| about the probationary period is you do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| have the right of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| But any employee who's been here at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| at least 12 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| has the right of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| and as I mentioned to Commissioner Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| we do have that personnel board in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| for appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| But it's almost hard to fire somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| even though we don't have civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| service here unless you document it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| And EEOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| they're just laying out there they want everybody to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| them up and that's how they make their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| living is challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| you on things like this is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I can't address how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| make their living but I will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| that yes terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| employees have contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| EEOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| And I believe that's free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| If they find a just cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| I don't believe the employee pays EEOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Having not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| been a person made a complaint to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| EEOC I cannot tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| But anyway I think we have protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| you know enough here and right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| we're going through a tight budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| and like Commissioner Wright was just talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| we're worrying about $50,000 here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Now we're talking about a million and a half where it's going to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| I would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| have to vote against this right now especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| during this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| But you are correct that EEOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| protection is out there and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| can access that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Yes part of what brought my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| attention to this and I am a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| co-sponsor on it and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| some of the concerns that you expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| and I've talked to some of the other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| and even those that Commissioner Lambert just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| expresses over the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| and maybe we don't need to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| an entire civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| But what brought my attention to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| was back during the primary election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| and it was actually my wife because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| she's at home during the day she received several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| phone calls there were three in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| where people who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| county employees that worked in some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| fee offices were asking her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| to vote for certain candidates and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| were almost tearful these women were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| they were single mothers and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| it was perceived or whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| it was real but they felt that if a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| candidate didn't win that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| jobs were in jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| and that's what really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| that's really where my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| interest in this developed is first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| of all is being certain that those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| do have some protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| so they won't lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| their jobs simply because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| they back the wrong candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| and then my second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| concern is why are these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| even participating in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| political process my brother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| is a civil servant engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| and he we came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| down here we were just going to get a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| family picture together for one of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| political advertisements and he wouldn't even get in the picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| with us because they're prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| as a federal employee he is prohibited by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| from participating in that at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| and I was wondering if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| you know part of my interest in this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| really removing those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| from the political process at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| in prohibiting them from campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| for a given candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| because I think if they really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| actively campaigned is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| it certainly would be a hostile work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| environment if their person lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| even if they didn't lose their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| and I didn't know what are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| present personnel guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| or regulations regarding their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| participation in political activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| on behalf of a certain candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I can tell you that Knox County's personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| and our employee handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| is particularly in our employee handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| that you will find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| policies regarding political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| and prohibiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| coercion of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| contributions or campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| prohibits them from campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| during work hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| we have those things in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| but unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| you're speaking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| county officials who have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| other sets of policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| they are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| under our particular or the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| the standard Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| personnel policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| they have not adopted those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| may address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| you know the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| government for a long time has been governed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| by the Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| and the state of Tennessee has what we call the Little Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| which basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| local government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| state employees too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| are not supposed to do any campaigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| or proselytizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| politically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| about a candidate during the work day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| First Amendment to the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| they cannot be chilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| from political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| after work hours obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Is that true for federal people too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| federal people may actually be under a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| restrictive situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| I'm almost certain they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| I know the military is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| I think we call our statute the Little Hatch Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| because it only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| governs your mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| at the workplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| during the work business hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| and then after that you're like any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| Yes I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| I know that Greg had several instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| and I have as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| but one that just comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| is Amy Vandergriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| that she chose to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| for county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| and she was fired basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| and she stood on the courthouse steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| and said this was for political reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| I believe that Mr. Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| had said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| that at first it was for her being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| perpetually late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| but then I have heard her on the campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| trail and in other statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| say that he has called to apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| that he fired her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| because it was not proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| that he did fire her for political reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| but also I'd like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Karen Day is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| she helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| with a lot of creation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| civil service rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| and I would just appreciate her opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| on some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| concerns that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| obviously I don't think we're interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| in creating a whole new HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| or creating any sort of new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| step program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| with regard to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| and compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| really all we're trying to do is enhance what Knox County already has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| and make it uniform across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| all of these office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| and make sure that all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| are protected and feel safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| in their job and in their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| and if you could speak to that Karen I would really appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Well I'll try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I don't have to give my age do I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Only if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Karen Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2077)|

| 0:34:41| Just for a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| I've been retired for 3 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| I was in the civil service department for 28 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| and I was the director for 14 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| I do know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| that the city's civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| system was created in 1926| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| 1982 we had a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| charter revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| which made it much stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| and refined it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| to the times I guess you would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| I've listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I'm completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| surprised at the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| that is given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| the city civil service department budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| when I left 3 years ago was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| $900,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| we are the human resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| department for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| is part of the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| but there are many other responsibilities that are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| by that department including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| the classification and compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| of all employees, a training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| program, the performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| appraisal system for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| lots of things that are involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| day to day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| there are about 5 employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| who have background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| to an industrial organizational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| psychology and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| in human resource management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| so they are qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| to do job analysis and develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| examinations and selection procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| like I think Commissioner Lambert said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| they are also doing a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| the hiring processes for the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| which would not be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| of the process in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| if you would tell me again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| what your question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| some of the things that Mrs. Fogerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| mentioned had to do with testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| and the costs associated with testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| now I understand that the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| already has the merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| so they already have an established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| testing system, proctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| those sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| so I'm sure that we have facilities available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| that we can utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| so we would not need to create a whole new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| with them in where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| use their testing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| also we have the Fairview Technology Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| next to Dogwood Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| that we own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| that we could use for testing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| but my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| with regard to costs associated with testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| what do you kind of recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| as a kind of a ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| well it's just a part of the day to day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| I don't think you could really say there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| cost that I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| specifically tell you but if the whole department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| budget is $900,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| okay that was incorporated into that whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| department budget, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| so I don't see how it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I mean they are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| like Frances has said there is a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| duplication like they're processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| all the applicants for the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| that's what civil service in the city does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| you are putting everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| in the computer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| that, the city system is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| a merit system for promotions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| throughout the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| you would have to have people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| on board who are qualified to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| examinations or some type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| of selection procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| it doesn't always have to be a written exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| part would be a cost that I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| she does not currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| in her budget for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| but I don't see how it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| I'll be available to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I think Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| had one, I don't know who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Frances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| if you'll come up to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Thank you Karen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you Karen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| the way I see this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| if it's political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I mean people that are hired on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| a job, I think they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| as long as they're office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| and they're doing their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| they have a pretty good chance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| staying there. They know up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| what they're buying. They know up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| when they put that application in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| that at the most it's going to be an 8 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| with term limits now it's going to be an 8 year stint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| and then they may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| run for the office themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| if the other person doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I mean it works all the way up to the White House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| when people know a new administration comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| those people are gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| but you don't see the wholesale turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| I've not had anybody call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Tell me again the cost that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| estimate it would cost for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| first year and then years after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| And I do want to make sure that you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| that as she talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| about training, compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| compliance, we have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| in our budget already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| we have persons in place to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I think that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| add those 5 new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| and that would bring us up to the city level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Just bottom line Frances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| We're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| spending a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| so I'm talking about to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| the $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| that makes the budget then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| $1.75 again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| we are doing benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| in addition to so our million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| budget includes employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| training, compliance, classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| compensation, benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| and wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| so to add the other 5 to bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| to the city's level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| I'm seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| plus the $50,000 you would need for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| appeals system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| in addition to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| we already are spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Frances can you explain what that $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| would cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| I'm not sure I quite understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Are you saying that to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| 5 people's salary would cost $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| No, no, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| 5 new positions including office space, furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| equipment, you know all the associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| costs with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| and some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| professional consultation that we would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| as start up because you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| about bringing in quite a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| more employees under the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| that we currently don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| So if as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| has been suggested that there are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| job descriptions out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| if we need to bring on job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| very, very quickly I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| my one employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| could handle doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| 500, 600, 700 more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| employees in terms of job analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| in a very quick fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| So you're saying that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| employee positions here currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| that we do not have job descriptions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| No ma'am I believe it was you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| that suggested in a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| a couple of months ago you said one of the things you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| to accomplish was to make sure that employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| had job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I took that as a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| that there were offices that didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| No ma'am I'm not saying that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| not job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| I would hope that every employee that you hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| has a job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| I know that every employee we hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| we have job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| I cannot speak for the other county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| What you're saying then is other county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| hire employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| without any sort of job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| No ma'am I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| you called me in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| and when I asked you what you were trying to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| by having civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| you said you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| employees to have job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| and for those job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| to have the basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| requirements for the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| the qualifications stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| I indicated to you that we had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| so I thought you were telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| me that the other offices did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| No ma'am I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| stating that at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| what I'm stating is that I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| to make sure with regard to the merit based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| hiring that the people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| we do hire meet those job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| qualifications and meet those standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| We have a system in place to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Yes ma'am but you're telling me now that all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| office holders that they have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| hiring policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| They certainly do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| And so what we need to make sure that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| is that we have a universal comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| that everyone is following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| that there are comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| that all the employees are meeting a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| level of requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| and that we have and are maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| just the top notch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| employees that we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| If you'll recall about five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| there was an efficiency panel that studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| this very thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| for quite a long while and came to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| with a recommendation that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| needed to bring all the elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| officials under one set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| of policies and one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| human resource system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| and we'll all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| that's an incredibly cost efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| and effective way to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Well then if we did that would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| not the cost that you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| to start this would it not balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| out if we had all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| incorporated into one HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| the cost associated with starting it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| as to the cost savings of making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| that we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| policies and procedures that are all under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| one roof, under one umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| you're saying that that would be a cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| and the expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| would be minimal at first to start out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| and I would think that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| only a benefit to the county to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| that we have a universal policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| and that we also have employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| protection. I think this is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| about making sure that employees are protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| that they have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| appeals process and that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| grievance process for those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I would agree and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| again to tell you we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| those policies, we have that grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| procedure, we have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| appeals process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| what we don't have is a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| to bring the other elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| officials under this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| there is a again Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| County set of personnel policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| and procedures, a Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| grievance and appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| process. Unfortunately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| we don't have all Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| offices utilizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| what we don't have is a way to bring them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Mr. Chairman I think I have the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| you know the way I look at this Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| I look at this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| the same thing as teacher tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| you know two years if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| straight out of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I can do a good job for the first two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| it's hard to get them out after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| there's things in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| with all due respect Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| we're trying to change the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| everything we're doing here on County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| is like the people that before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| us were a bunch of blooming idiots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| and I think some people have made some good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| decisions in the past and I don't want to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| to change the world here in eight months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| what the big issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| we need to understand is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| fee offices have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| to opt out and that's what they've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| and we have no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| of making them opt in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Commissioner Daniels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| like some of the others I'm a co-sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| of this because I wanted to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| it and see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| see what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| to make things better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I agree we've tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| to do a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| those of us who are appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| as one has called us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| illegitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| my parents were extremely disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| to hear about that this weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| when you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| who's given to certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| campaigns and there's a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| of employees a mile along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| you know are they giving because they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| like they have to or are they giving because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| my guess is it's probably a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| of the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| you know I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| complaints as well I've had employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| come to me and say you know I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| give money I don't make enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| to give money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| but I give so that hopefully I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| get a good raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| and I'll be looked upon favorably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| and I think that's pathetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| you know and I hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| that and if they don't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| then they can move on I mean this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| the job for life if they're not happy where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| they're at then go somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| else out in the public work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| Larry we've got a lot of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| work here because maybe they started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| years ago and they enjoy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| and because of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| that I believe this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| has gotten more and more political as years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| have gone on and I feel that some of these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| feel like you know some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| them get to a certain age and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| you know you're not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| hireable as you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| when you were 30 years old when you get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| be 50 years old you're not as high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| your ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| to be hired is not as great as it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| when you were 30 or you just came out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| college I mean companies all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| over this country lay people off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| because of the fact that it's cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| to bring in a 22 year old right out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| of college than it is to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| 55 year old who's worked their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| up the ranks so you know it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| it does make it tough on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| these employees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| you know I've had a lot of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| over my career and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| you know I didn't look at it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| you know I felt like an employee is an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| and you know the more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| I put into them and training them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| bringing them along the better return on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| investment I get and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| I'm not saying civil service is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| cure all I'm not saying it's what we necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| need to do I think we do need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| as commissioners to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I think we need to ask people like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Ms. Fogerson and the lady that had retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| from the city you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| Henry Ford was smart enough to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| no one's you know no one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| as smart none of us is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| as smart as all of us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| you know if we all put our heads together I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| can find better ways to run our government better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| ways to run personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| I don't think it's up to just one or two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| to make those decisions I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| you know if we all talk about it we can find better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| ways to do things and more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Commissioner Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you Mr. Chairman I was chairman of that efficiency panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| that you were talking about and at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| there were nine citizens who looked at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| aspects of Knox County government that was one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| the recommendations at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| however we did not have the ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| on the charter government that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| and we brought in some outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| experts we looked at this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| and we met with each office holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| fee office holder and asked them would you be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| to come under the Knox County plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| and at that time 100% of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| said no we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| to maintain our own policies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| procedures and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| you know what the county does is fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| but we're not going to come under that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| so we were asking for voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| means of doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| now with this being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| a charter amendment again there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| legal issues here but I just wanted everyone to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| that that's kind of the background is we tried to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| done but it had to be a voluntary basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| and the fee office holder said no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| You have another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Yeah I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| to say to Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I mean with all due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| me and you and several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| of the folks on this body we're self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| employed we're not in the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| where we have to worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| about our jobs we have to worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| about whether we're going to make a profit or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| It's choices that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| It puts a lot of stress on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| employees every time we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| an election and if we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| something to and what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| here let's just say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| nepotism and cronyism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| if civil service can put an end to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| that where they don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| forced to become someone's crony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| or act like someone's crony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| for fear of losing their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I think that it would create a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| more pleasant work environment and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| I don't think it's going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| nearly as much as has been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Then who's going to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Let me say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| I think the officers that are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| problems are the fee officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| By state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| we cannot make them come under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Tank I've had complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| from every office several of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| every office except the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| sheriff's office. Well I've been here six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| I've never heard anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| This is not a time for debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Dr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| I was just going to make the same point you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| because the ones that I've heard the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| complaints from had come from the fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| officers and I haven't heard a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| otherwise it was mostly just back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| during the election process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| when they were calling trying to get us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| to vote for somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Do we have any other public comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| We have one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| that has signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| Actually I'm here also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3115)|

| 0:51:59| As a matter of introduction my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3119)|

| 0:52:07| employed here in Knox County Government for over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| 27 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| I've seen many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| especially in my early years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| here. Directors had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| the discretion back then to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| whoever they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Didn't have to worry about any qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| They could pay them whatever they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| Just as long as they had the money in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| They could give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| raises whenever they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Not the way we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Not the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I myself was the recipient of two raises during my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| probationary first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| My boss liked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| These were not all good things but that's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| business was conducted back then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Things are very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3171)|

| 0:54:37| Every one of us goes through an orientation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| when we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3279)|

| 0:54:45| in air quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I must utilize an employee request form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| It requires check-offs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and signatures right on up the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3291)|

| 0:54:55| to fill the position is obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3295)|

| 0:54:59| Applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| come to HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| They're reviewed by HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| to determine if they meet the minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| qualifications for the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| And these qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| are outlined in the job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| for each of those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Once the posting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| is closed, HR sends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| me the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3319)|

| 0:55:25| applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| HR is very tough on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| I've tried to get applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I've called Francis before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| and said, surely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| you've got some others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| I want to say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| We don't get those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| We only get who's qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| These policies are tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| They're fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| They keep us out of the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| The same way with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| Unfortunately, we do have to terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| employees from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| We go through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| grievance process with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| They have the right to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| We take it very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| We know we're talking about somebody's lives out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| Please don't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| If you're trying to go after these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| elected officials, work with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| offices. Come up with some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| to bring those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| But please don't mess with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| what we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| It works. We all know the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| We'd like to keep it. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Barbara Cook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| It's cold in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| And I really don't know where to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| This is an interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| I sent each of you the letter that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| sent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| when she asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| about this, and at the time it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| And now it's a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| So I really don't know what we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| about here if we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| about the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| But just for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| I'd like to get my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| letter read into the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| And then I have just a couple of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| This is to Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| I received a copy of your memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| and the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| I want to thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| to comment on it, and thank you for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| consideration you are giving to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| I have read the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| and wanted to get my initial comments to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| in a timely fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| so you have time to consider their worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| May I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| at the outset that I'm neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| regarding the subject of a civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| system for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| I see advantages and disadvantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| on both sides of the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| My biggest concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| is that any system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| that gets implemented is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| with careful consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| the appropriate level of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| and the involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| of all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| who will be impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| It has been my observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| that many resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| are passed without those elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| and as a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| provide more confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| than solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| As to this particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| I have the following concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Based on definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| of the major players in the proposed system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| they are political appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| The secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| that is the director of human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| is appointed by and reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| to the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| is unclassified and could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| replaced at the discretion of any mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| The members of the merit board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| would be political appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| also. Why the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| would have a vote on who gets elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| to the board is a conundrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| since the ordinance specifies that the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| personnel would be unclassified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Affording votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| to the fee officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| when the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| of the commission's authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| to impose a civil service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| in those offices has not been resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| is also a mystery to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| There are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| minimum qualifications specified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| for either the secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| or the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| The powers and duties of these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| are vast and if properly executed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| will require a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| of time and expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| While there is oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| by the commission in terms of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| a mechanism for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| an internal review and approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| is lacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| The commission should not be the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| review or checkpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| between creation and implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| of policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| governing working conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| as well as classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| plans and compensation schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| The ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| as written is specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| in some areas and general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| in others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| For example, Section 1.16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| is a list of actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| with no specificity as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| they must be taken in sequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| Section 1.19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| however is very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| These two items are equally important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| disciplinary action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| and layoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| and should be equally defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| The level of detail required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| in the ordinance to make it both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| effective and consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| should be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| Finally, and I consider this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| Much would be required to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| this ordinance in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| The timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| of this implementation including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| the sequence of events that should take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| place and the method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| for communicating to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| and involving the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| is not provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| It's always difficult for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| to offer criticism without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| suggesting possible alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| I consider it unfair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| However, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| subject is not one that lends itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| to brief suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| I realize that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| conversation has to begin somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| and that you are limited to the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| of time you will personally be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| to keep this moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| So may I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| simply suggest that the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| be drafted such that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| it specifies intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| a direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and a timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| without the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| The how really needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| to be worked out by those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| involved in the day-to-day operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| of each office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| managers and employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| without the political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| and approved by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| commission when completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| as amendments to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I want to thank you for taking this step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| and for giving employees the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| I hope this helps some and I would be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| to discuss this subject further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| at your convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| So that's my letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| And there's just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| that I think are important to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| I'm amazed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| at every time there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| something extra that needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| in this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| it means more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| and more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| At some point in time you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| have got to recognize that you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| a mechanism in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| for determining effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| and efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| You have no idea when somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| comes and tells you that it's going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| a million dollars whether that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| up here or down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| or someplace in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| I just would like you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| to back up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| and take this picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| in pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| You don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| entirely line by line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| My goodness the city didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| get to this overnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| It takes time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| You have to think this stuff out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Don't go slapping something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| there's a perceived need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| has problems and everybody has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| complaints. I'm lucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| I look scared to say things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| I haven't been scared up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| But you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080721publichearing?start=3824)|
