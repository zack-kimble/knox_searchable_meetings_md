| 0:00:00| Now, the basic legal premise, and keep in mind, our task in commencing this research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:25| was to examine the legal import in what I'll just refer to as the Briggs Memorandum, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=25)|
| 0:00:36| shorthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| I know it was not drafted by Dr. Briggs, but by Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| But Dr. Briggs circulated it, submitted it to our office, asked that we take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| it and proposed resolutions, a resolution and an ordinance based on the legal conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=48)|
| 0:00:56| in the McAdams Memorandum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=56)|
| 0:01:00| And the basic underlying premise of that memorandum is that in November of 2006, the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=60)|
| 0:01:16| Charter created, by referendum, these offices, Property Assessor, Sheriff, Register of Deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:26| County Clerk and Trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| Now both the Briggs Memorandum and my office agree that the Supreme Court held in Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=92)|
| 0:01:40| that the old constitutional officers were by inference retained and continued to exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| under the original Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| So there's no legal dispute that leading up to November of 2006, these officials were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=111)|
| 0:02:01| constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| So the question then is whether or not by referendum in November of 2006, when the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| Review Committee met and drafted amendments which were voted into law and became part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| of the Charter, whether they changed that and whether they in fact created those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| Our conclusion is that they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:36| If you look, you'll see on the left where we've captioned rejected language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=156)|
| 0:02:46| There was a proposal, it was originally drafted by the Knox County Law Director's Office at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| that time and the Charter Review Committee considered it and rejected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=172)|
| 0:03:00| That language was, there is hereby created the office of Knox County Property Assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| And we attached exhibits to the materials that we provided to each of you where we quoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| from pertinent parts of the transcripts of the meetings of the Charter Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| in order to garner their intent so that we would know exactly what the people were voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| The final language says instead of there is hereby created, the duties of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| assessor are vested in and exercised by the Knox County Property Assessor in the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| same language was used for each and every one of the other offices, the Sheriff, County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Clerk, Trustee, and Register of Deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=230)|
| 0:04:01| Now you see language there on the left, that is from one of the members of the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| Review Committee who made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| And the motion was that the hereby created language would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=255)|
| 0:04:23| And then you have committee member Anderson, actually it was Bruce Anderson who was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| chair of the Charter Review Committee, showing that there was a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:37| And that the ballot question be amended to delete the word to create the elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=277)|
| 0:04:48| Now while there was discussion ongoing on that motion, another member of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| suggested adding language that would acknowledge that the constitutional offices already existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| and were not being created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| This is quoting Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=308)|
| 0:05:21| See the exchange where he says, and he ends it by saying, I think we need to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| a sentence that acknowledges the office exists before we go into duties and qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| And we've given a citation to the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Excuse me for interrupting Mr. Loderick, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| So in your previous slide you used the word constitutional, but Mr. Duncan actually never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| uses that word to describe those offices, if I'm looking at the quote correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| In this quote, this is an exact quote, so this is what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Yeah, so it was your interpretation to add the adjective constitutional in the preceding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| Go back to the preceding slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Yeah, all he said was that the offices already existed, he didn't use that descriptor, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Well, keep in mind as I already explained, the Briggs Memorandum and my office agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=375)|
| 0:06:23| that in Jordan, the Supreme Court said these were constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| So that's not a legal dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Going into this charter review process, these were constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| I just want to make sure that Mr. Duncan is quoted correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| He was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Without an adjective being added to a descriptor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| And as you can see, Mr. Duncan said that he thought that there needed the motion, taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| out the hereby created language, needed to go further and acknowledge the office exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=418)|
| 0:07:13| The former Chief Deputy Law Director who was in attendance then suggested language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| could it say vested in an exercise, exercised by, and the Ms. Young who made the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=439)|
| 0:07:27| motion accepted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| And a roll call vote was then taken which passed unanimously 17 to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:44| The amendment as adopted was the exact language that Ms. Stackhouse suggested at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=464)|
| 0:07:56| that the powers would be vested in and exercised by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Now, to understand this and to get a feel for the intent of what was going on at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| time, Chancellor John Weaver had rendered his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| And in his opinion regarding the legal effect of the charter, he found that there were deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:27| in the original charter adopted and that went into effect in 1990 because of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| that the enabling legislation required that when you talk about certain administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:43| and executive offices, you had to do the following things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| You had to set forth the titles, qualifications, compensation, and duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| Now if you'll go back and you'll remember that the offices that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=534)|
| 0:09:06| some were not even mentioned in the charter because of the belief that you couldn't affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| constitutional officers by local charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| So the original committee that drafted the language of the Knox County Charter back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| in 1988 stayed away from those offices because they were of the opinion that it was unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:34| that they couldn't affect them, that they couldn't change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| We now know that not to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| But because they didn't set forth qualifications, compensation, duties, and titles, Chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:52| Weaver said, you haven't complied with the enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=592)|
| 0:10:02| So after Chancellor Weaver issued his opinion, the Knox County mayor and this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:11| set up the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| And it cured those deficiencies by drafting Article IV of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=615)|
| 0:10:24| Article IV names the offices and sections 4.01 through 4.05 reflect that the duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| of each of those officers are vested in and exercised by them just as discussed as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| saw earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| Then it goes on to say that their duties, qualifications, oath of office, bond requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:51| and compensation are more fully described by reference to the Constitution and laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| of the state of Tennessee and the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| So by the express terms of the Charter, these officers are subject to the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:13| the general laws of the state of Tennessee, and the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| With all due respect, the Briggs Memorandum in reaching the conclusions that it does would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:30| sever the Knox County Charter's express reference to the Constitution and laws of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| of Tennessee and place sole emphasis on the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| And that construction is contrary to long-standing, well-recognized rules of statutory construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:52| As you can see, it's the law in Tennessee that a statute ought to be construed so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| every word shall have force and effect and that no clause or word shall be superfluous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| or insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| And the Briggs Memorandum would render the Knox County Charter's reference to the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| of the state of Tennessee superfluous because it takes the position that the general laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| of the state of Tennessee have no effect on these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=738)|
| 0:12:29| In Jordan, the Supreme Court said, referenda are to be construed with great deference because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:37| when citizens vote in a referendum, they are presumed to know the issue on which they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Why is there such a legal presumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| That's so you can't come back later and say, well, even though the people voted, they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=768)|
| 0:13:01| really know what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| So the law presumes that the voters knew exactly what they were doing when they adopted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| amendments to the Knox County Charter in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| The intent of the drafters of Article 4, I think, is made clear in their debates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:27| And it was not to create new charter offices, but to carry into the charter those offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:37| already in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Let me preface this by, I think you said this in the beginning, you know, it's nothing personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and I enjoy these arguments as much as anyone and you know that I respect you and I respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| Joe and your entire staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Same for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| But I respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| And first of all, when you're talking about what the intent was of the Charter Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| Committee that convened in the summer of 2006, I'm going to make a direct quote from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| Bruce Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| And he was the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| I'll remind everyone, I know you quoted another member of that committee, but Bruce Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| was the chairman of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And he said, quote, the committee members believed that the fee offices existed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| were functioning offices, but also they were charter offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Otherwise they couldn't be term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| They predated the charter, but the charter confirmed that these offices were part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| the Knox County government and therefore part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| I never said that they weren't part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| I said that they were not created by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| The charter expressly says that they are subject to the provisions of the charter, but it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| says that they are subject to the constitution of the state of Tennessee and the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| laws of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| The general laws of the constitution of the state of Tennessee says specifically that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| those duties that are performed by the constitutional officers must be performed under the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| In other words, we have to have someone that collects property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| We need a sheriff who's the chief law enforcement officer of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| We need to have someone to perform the functions that the county clerk and that the register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| of the deeds perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| What they're saying is that we can't abrogate those responsibilities and duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| That's the county's job to do those and the state is not going to do those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| Those have to be provided for in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| That's what I feel they mean by the constitutional requirements and also those that fall under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| the laws of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| What they're saying is that the charter has to provide for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| It does, but it doesn't say that if the charter provides for those that they are exclusively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:07| governed by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Nowhere does it say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| In fact, the expression by Mr. Anderson, who's a very well-respected, well-known attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:22| who was the chair of the committee, keep in mind that just as this body can vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:31| adopt a resolution or an ordinance, what one of you says on a particular point doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:42| make the determinative factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| When you vote on a specific resolution or ordinance, that's how you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| The Charter Review Committee had before it a motion that specifically rejected the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| that said hereby create these offices and had part and parcel of it language that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| we wanted to recognize that these offices already existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| That passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Mr. Anderson voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| The next point that I would, but the intention of the committee was is that these were charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| offices and that they would be part of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| Let's examine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| The enabling legislation says what you can and can't do and it doesn't say that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:38| have, that you have to have an office that is only subject to the charter or only subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:48| to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Basically what the enabling legislation says and what the Supreme Court said in Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| and in Bailey was the county's free to do what it wants to do in terms of setting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| its form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| You can make offices, you can carry them over, you can do a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:16| From the discussion from the Charter Review Committee, it's clear that what they intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| was to carry over offices that were already in existence and make them subject to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| just the charter, but the laws passed by the legislature and the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| If you, nowhere is there language in their discussions or in the charter itself that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:43| says they're governed only by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| In fact, the Knox County Charter specifically states that their duties are those that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| described by the Charter Review Committee in 2006 and those that are set forth in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| Constitution, the general laws of the state and the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| So they're subject to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| And see what I would contend is that when they're saying those duties that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| by the Constitution, they're simply saying that there are certain things that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| to be able to do even under the charter government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| The next point that I would like to make is that, and I'm quoting here directly from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Tennessee Code annotated, is that when a charter is adopted under the statute, the alternate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| form replaces the existing form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| We've been over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I think we agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| And under law, no right, power, duty, obligation, or function of any officer, agency, or office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| of the county shall be retained and continued unless the charter of such county expressly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| so provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| The next point I would like to make, and this is in the Jordan ruling, is that, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| came up-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| I don't want to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Let me address what you just said and then we can go to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| And the reason I'm saying that is that there's no place in the amendment that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| that create, you want to talk created or continued or whatever the term is, those offices that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| we're referring to now as the fee offices, there's no place in there that it expressly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| provides that they are immune and they do not need to follow the provisions of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| that deals with budget, contracting, and who administers the law of those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:37| It's not expressly provided there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I never said that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| All I said was that they're subject to all three bodies of law, the Constitution, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| general laws, and the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| If you ever have a conflict between any of those, what governs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| That's also answered in Jordan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| In Jordan, on page 782, the Supreme Court specifically said, and what they were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:10| at that point in time was, well, since the term limits amendment said it covered all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:16| elected officials, well, it should cover all elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| And that would mean everybody, school board, judges, you know, every elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| And the Supreme Court went through the list and said why some were subject and some were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| And what they said was this, Commissioner, on page 782, the Supreme Court referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| members of the school board mentioned the Education Improvement Act, which preempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| the imposition of term limits for school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| And the Supreme Court said the statute, meaning the state statute, trumps the charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| as to members of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| So what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| That means if elected officials are subject to both the charter and the general laws of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| the state of Tennessee and a conflict arises between the two, the state statute trumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| I'd also like to point out, and this is on page 22 of the Jordan decision, and they address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| the problem of where there's a conflict between some of these charter offices or the constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| offices and the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| And it says, indeed, if a chartered county cannot abolish the constitutional offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| and is compelled to retain them, the new form of government would be controlled by the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| As a result, this court specifically rejects this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| I've never argued to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| What was at issue and what the Supreme Court was saying there, they were addressing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| argument that was made by some of the constitutional officers in that case that, hey, we can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| be affected by term limits because we're constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| And all the Supreme Court was saying was, yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| The Supreme Court was saying that term limits can apply to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| Supreme Court was going a step further in saying that if a county wants to abolish them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| it can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| But that's not what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| No one has ever contended that these offices were abolished, unless, I guess, that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| you're contending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| I don't contend that they were abolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| In the Jordan decision, they go into a long discussion about de jure, or I guess that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| how you pronounce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| They're established, actually, by law in de facto, where they're functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| And they're there by fact, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| And this was a de facto continuation of those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| It wasn't a de jure because it wasn't specifically called for in the original charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| And that was an omission that was noted both by chancellery court and by the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| that needed to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| And that's what the Charter Review Committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| And that's why those matters were on the ballot in November of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| I want to go back to one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| I'm on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| This resolution is going to come up in one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| This is not the law of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| This will go on forever because I'm, neither one of y'all are going to, I've got two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Can I make one last point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| And I promise I'll stop after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| Is that the last point that I would like to make, again, gets to the point where no right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| power, duty, obligation, or function is retained unless it's expressly provided for by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| And that's not expressly provided for by that amendment where, that passed in 2000, in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| of 2006 on what the functions, duties, et cetera of those charter offices were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| The problem is, is that these officers, which we referred to previously as the constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| officers are, it states specifically in the charter that the executive branch of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| has the sole responsibility to make contracts and any contract over $50,000 must come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:29| the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| That's not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| It says that the law director is the sole individual that will administer to the legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| affairs of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| That's not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| It says that a budget will be submitted to the county mayor to be compiled and submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| to the consolidated, compiled, and submitted to the county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| That's not being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| And what I'm saying is that none of the legislation, none of the amendments that we have to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| county charter says that those officers are excluded or they're immune or there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| sort of enabling legislation that provides for them, it's not expressly provided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| they do not have to follow those elements of our county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| And what I'm saying is that I don't want any new legislation passed, I don't want anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| else passed, but those provisions that are in our county charter, because they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| expressly excluded, those officers, I feel that they need to do what's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| Now the reason I think that that's important, and again, we talked about the will of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| The people passed the county charter by vote in 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| They wanted this form of government, it's called home rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| We've had abuses in some of those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Some of them may have been exaggerated, some of them not, but there's been allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| of people running campaigns out of those offices, there's been allegations of them forcing their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| employees to go out and campaign for them, to donate to their campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| Just this past couple of weeks, we've found out that there's been payroll abuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| We've also found out, and it was on the New Sentinel site today, where the Tennessee Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| of Investigation has come in and looked at PCARD abuses even in these fee offices, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| they've frozen those records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| I think that the outcry that I'm hearing from the people, and again, I think we can't ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| What they're saying, both by their vote in 1990, by accepting home rule, and also by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| what we're seeing now, demands that we go forward with enforcing what's in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I very respectfully listen to what you're saying, and I think this is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| to be, and I'm not a lawyer, but even assuming that other people are, you can have good lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| that disagree, and that's why things go to court, but I think that this is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| enough that when this resolution comes forward next month, that we need to vote to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Now, it very well may result in a lawsuit, and this may have to be decided at a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| court, maybe the chancellery court, it may even be appealed to the Tennessee Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Court, but I think this issue is not going to be settled until we decide to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| And from what I'm hearing from the citizens and the people, this needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| And I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| May I close, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Oh, word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Again, let me reiterate, this is from my perspective and the perspective of my office about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| law and the law only, whether or not these proposals are wise and good is a matter to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| be determined by this body, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| That's not my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I'm here simply attempting to give you guidance as to what the law allows and does not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1734)|
| 0:29:07| And then you vote your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| You have before you, again, the enabling legislation that Dr. Briggs mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| And you see that it allows the voters of a county to retain and continue officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1758)|
| 0:29:28| I've provided to you the verbatim debates by the Charter Review Committee as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:36| their intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| And I suggest to you this, the language that is in the Knox County Charter, the powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| of these offices would be vested in and exercised by was language chosen, rejecting the hereby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| created language for the express purpose of continuing existing offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| Now, legal scholars and commentators debate the meaning of the Constitution all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:09| And the Supreme Court in Bailey and Jordan said that when a county adopts a charter form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| of government, it is in effect the Constitution for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| And those legal scholars would give anything in deciphering the intent of the U.S. Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| to have available to them verbatim transcripts of what happened in the original Constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| And I've provided it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| And it says what the drafters intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Just very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| Commissioner Briggs or our law director, could you provide for us kind of a bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| summary of what the changes would be under your proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| I know that we've gotten a lengthy document, but if we could kind of narrow that down with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| bullet points to say, all right, here is what we have and here are the changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Maybe I've already got it and I just didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| But that would be helpful to me if we could have that maybe by the agenda committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Because I would really like to sit down with the fee offices and perhaps, you know, others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| I really need to wrap my arms around this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| But if there's a way that we could maybe get some kind of here's where it is now, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| are the changes that are and the impact of those changes, perhaps, that would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| We'll endeavor to work with Commissioner Briggs and do just that and work with the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| Let me just say that in doing that and the reason I place special emphasis on the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| laws of the state of Tennessee and the reason that I quoted from the excerpt in Jordan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| said the statute trumps the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| The problem is that there are state statutes that address these offices and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| Briggs mentioned the provision in the Knox County Charter that says the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| shall be the sole legal representative for these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| There are also general laws of the state of Tennessee that specifically address the delinquent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| tax attorney, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I know that's been an issue of contention and there are state statutes that specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| say how the delinquent tax attorney is chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| So if there is a conflict between the charter and the state statute, in that regard, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:45| state statute is going to trump the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| That's why we get onto shaky ground if we start saying we're just going to ignore what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| state law says and just do what's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| These rules of statutory construction that I talked about are there to try to harmonize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| provisions so that if there is a conflict between one or the other, you have to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:17| that one that predominates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| Our Supreme Court has said that the state law would trump the charter if there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| a conflict between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:45| This is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| I guess what I'm asking for is kind of a resolution for dummies for me so that I can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| I think also it's important for the public to fully understand the changes that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| talking about so that when they read it, they can read it and say, okay, here's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| we're doing now and this is exactly what the Commission is proposing with their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| But this is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Well, I was about that and this is not a legal argument or a legal statement that I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:18| to make right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| That's what we've been arguing up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| But I think it gets back to do we want to run government like a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Do we want to run it in an open fashion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Do we want to make it something so the citizens can understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| And it's the biggest hodgepodge of ways of running things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| We have five different ways of doing payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| We have three different ways of doing contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| And I think even when we had the external auditor come in, and those of you that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| on the committee, I was up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I'm not a member of the committee, but I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And they were talking about the material deficiencies that they identified in the budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| and the way the accounting was going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| They said that if this were in the places that we know this is government and it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| the private sector, but they said if this was the audit committee of a private company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| they would have grave and serious concerns over the risk of fraud being committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| And that statement was made by our external auditor, the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| The previous auditor, Rutherford Moss, that we had in 2007, in June, they did a human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| resources assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| They identified numerous problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| And essentially the response was from many of those offices is we're going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| to do business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| And we saw and we have seen some of the abuses that have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| And with the investigation going on as we speak by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| I have a feeling they're going to uncover more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| There was an article that's been, that's come up on the Knox News site already about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| things that have happened since this meeting has been going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| The point being is we need to run government like a business that people can have confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| in that it's being run correctly, that their tax dollars are not being squandered, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| fraud is not being committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And I would make an appeal to you that as you look at this, we can make a legal argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| but let's just try to do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| Use a common sense approach to do things right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:29| On page 17, discussion regarding the terms of the members of the Audit Committee as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| relates to Ordinance 0-08-7-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| This is deferred from February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| No, this is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Were you going to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| No, I was just going to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| You know, I think, a little more background than I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| We need to continue for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| So you defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I concur with Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I mean, Commissioner Wright and hopefully Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| It got a discussion item, but we must have voted on it in the Governmental and Finance also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| So now you want to defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| It was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| I think we should, don't you, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Yes, it needs to be deferred another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| Make a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Move and second that we defer this discussion item until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Discussion regarding the Judicial Commissioner appointment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| And Governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| No action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| We just, I don't know whether our Law Director is able to take another issue so quickly after that strenuous one he just undertook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2277)|
| 0:38:08| My head hurts just thinking about that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| But, so I just, obviously the process of Judicial Commissioner was kind of rough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| and therefore we thought it would be a good idea for us to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| And I don't know, do you have any things to say about the process today, Mr. Lockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| or you just want us to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| Just, the thinking generally, and again this is very rough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:42| and what we were hoping to propose to both the Judicial Committee and Intergovernmental was a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:53| so that what happens, what happened last time doesn't repeat itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| In the first instance, the General Sessions Court judges will propose a slate of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:07| Let's say there's one opening, one vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Depending on how many Commission wanted, the General Sessions Court judges could propose three names or four names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2351)|
| 0:39:19| that were acceptable to them, and then Commission would pick from one of those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| That way what happened last time wouldn't happen again, and there would be some other things to go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| So the slate would go to the Judicial Review Committee, the Judicial Commissioners Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| and then recommendation would come from that committee back to the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| When I mentioned the Judicial Committee, what I was talking about was sending to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| and to the Intergovernmental Committee a written process for you to approve and recommend to the full Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| And what that process would be, at least part of it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| that the General Sessions Court judges would propose to Commission a slate of acceptable candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| and that way what happened last time would not repeat itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| So we'll take that up next in the ensuing month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| No motions needed, I guess. We'll just go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Commissioner Luthell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Commissioner Norman, as you may recall, during the last process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| we asked for the Session Court judges to be a part of that process, and they declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:51| In fact, early in the process, they did approach me with one name that they told me they would reject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2451)|
| 0:41:01| and I think that person eventually pulled their name out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| and did not come before us to give their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| I would have thought at that time that if they had others that they knew that they would reject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| that they would have let Commissioners know, or possibly that candidate know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| that they would be rejected even if they got the nod from the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| We tried before to get these judges to be a part of it. They declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| Mr. Law Director, is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| We did not ask them to be, and they did not want to be a subject to the Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| if they were a part of the Judiciary Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| I can't speak to their motivation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| and I hesitate to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| But an invitation was extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| And they didn't act on it, but since what happened has happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| I suspect in some private conversations with some of the judges that they're willing to change the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| I invited them to be a part of it because I wanted their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| so that we would not have the problem that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| I don't think they want that to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I would hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Let me say, from the standpoint of this body, these appointments are political appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:53| Now, I don't mean that in a derogatory fashion, meaning that they're not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| But this is a political body, so it makes the appointments legally, by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| But they have a different aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| They're judicial officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| They're not members of a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| So they have the process as it involves them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| And judges, by law, are used to doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| They hold court, but they make their decisions between their two ears and what they write in an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| So I think what we're talking about doing in terms of allowing them to recommend candidates to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:44| permits the process to go in a fashion that is orderly and is as it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:56| Commissioner Norman, do you want to make a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| Yeah, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| We're going to go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| I need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2656)|

| 0:44:53| All 19 commissioners are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Request of John King for rezoning from RA low-density residential to PR plan residential at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Property located on the southwest side of Eddington Road, northeast side of Wells Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| northwest side of Willoughby Road in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Do you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| I think I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901, here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2723)|
| 0:45:32| I think this body is aware that MPC had approved rezoning at three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| This matter had been postponed before while we were getting some other things in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| I would ask that it be postponed again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| We have a variance item that's now come up in front of the Board of Zoning Appeals Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| We didn't have a meeting last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| But if we will, I would like to postpone this one 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| I have talked to the other interested people and advised them of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| I don't know whether any of them are here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| I don't think they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| But I told them that I would be asking it be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| So I would ask it be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| We'll probably move and second that it be postponed for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2785)|

| 0:47:16| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| The property owner and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| Do you want to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| Mr. Chair, as read into the record, this is a request for a plan amendment from low density residential to medium density residential and for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential that actually tend to use per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:53| This property is located at the, where Wood Smith Road meets Barnard Road and Sood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2873)|
| 0:48:06| It's in an area that includes, let me run to the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:15| An area that includes a lot of residential zoning ranging from the RA district, which can result in development at roughly 3 to 4 dwelling units per acre, to plan residential zoning that is in the neighborhood of 5 dwelling units per acre on up to plan residential zoning at 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:43| There's a small portion of the area that's still zoned under the county's agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| So it is a developing and established residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| The plan commission in reviewing the staff recommendation as well as the testimony from both the applicant and neighborhood representatives voted to approve the plan amendment to MDR medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2933)|
| 0:49:09| That was by a vote of 9 to 1 to 1, and then approve a plan residential zoning at up to 7.5 dwelling units per acre with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:22| Number one being no clearing or grading of the site shall occur prior to use on review concept plan approval by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| And number two, development be limited to townhomes of no more than two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| They took into consideration the area development and zoning pattern as I just described to you on the zoning and the development of the area and does include a mix of single family detached dwellings as well as some attached development primarily to the north of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:51| They also considered the fact that the site does have some constraints to it, physical constraints in terms of slope and sink holes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=2991)|
| 0:50:00| And also, too, there is some minor concern with regard to access to these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| But in looking at the total picture, what the staff recommended, and the staff recommended five dwelling units per acre, they looked at the total picture in terms of the surrounding area development pattern, zoning pattern as well as the constraints affecting the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:24| and voted to recommend plan residential zoning, again, at 7.5 dwelling units per acre, which is somewhat in between the staff recommendation and what the applicant requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:40| You want to go first, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr. I'm here on behalf of the applicant and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| This is Don Hollifield here. He is the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| This is Raj Sud, who proposes to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| Let me give you just a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| We originally requested the sector plan amendment and plan residential at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| That is consistent with what Mr. Sud and his father have been doing on property that is adjacent to this and is to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:20| They have built over 200 townhomes up there plus single-family detached homes in a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:30| That property has been developed along Sud Road, which goes straight into a part of this property, and along Raj Road, which runs over generally towards Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:44| The part of that property where Mr. Sud and his father developed over 200 units of townhomes is zoned at plan residential 1 to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:58| It is actually built out at about 10 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| And then there is a single-family subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| As I mentioned, he asked originally for 12. He figures 10 and actually 9.75 in discussions with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3127)|
| 0:52:17| MPC has imposed two conditions on its recommendation, which are certainly satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3137)|
| 0:52:27| He has, in discussion with Commissioner Norman, agreed, and we would ask that if approval is granted to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:36| that there be no construction of townhomes on property that has a slope of greater than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:45| As you know, the plan residential zone is a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| Actually, it's much longer than that, but there is a two-step public approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| First, we have to have the zoning, and that's what we're here for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| Second, that does not give Mr. Sud the right to do anything to the property other than to go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:14| and submit a concept plan, which you might go ahead and hand this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| Mr. Sud is an architect and has played with this himself, but he will not do the final engineering or architectural work for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:31| That will be done by qualified engineers and architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| Not that he's not, but anyway, it's his own project and he will not be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| So we will come back to MPC if a rezoning is granted and submit a detailed concept plan to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:55| That will go back through a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| And finally, we will come back and do planning where necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| This project will add about 100 townhomes to Mr. Sud's townhome project, which has over 200 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:19| There have been issues raised by one person who lives quite a distance from the project about the intersection of Woodsmith Road and Bernard Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:29| MPC staff noted in their comments that that condition will have to be dealt with at the concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| Mr. Sud's, they built Sud Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Mr. Seymour, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| They built Rogers Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| They understand that they will have to develop a road plan that is satisfactory with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| I don't see Cindy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| That is satisfactory with the Metropolitan Planning Commission and that meets the public approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| They will have to do that with the other infrastructure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| We would like Knox County to help if we get that far, but we realize where the road budget is this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| and Mr. Sud is prepared to go ahead and do the necessary road improvements as he develops this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| Those will have to be done early on in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| What we're asking for tonight is that you all agree with MPC to change the sector plan from low-density residential to medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:37| and that you zone the property planned residential at 9.75 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| and that you add a condition that no townhomes will be built on slope that exceeds 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| in addition to the other conditions that MPC imposed on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Mr. Seymour, I need your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| I'm sorry, 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902 Residences, 1805 Ridgecrest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| Sir, you have five minutes to rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| My name is Daniel Humphrey, 6709 Ellesmere Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| I request that you approve the rezoning and the sector change plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| per what was approved by the Metropolitan Planning Commission at 7.5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| and that it be limited to townhomes and no grading or anything until they have their concept plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| I mean, I did not find that out until today, and I was their opposition at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| and I had to find out from MPC staff that they were coming back and asking for 10 units per acre instead of 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| I mean, if I'm your opposition, and I've come in front of this body before as a registered land surveyor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| asking for stuff like this, and it's always been told to me that you should always meet with your opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| Mr. Sood called me a week ago, would have been last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| and said he had some road plans he wanted to show me that was done in 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| That's all he ever mentioned to me about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| I just respectfully request that we keep it at 7.5 units per acre because that road is narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I know, you know, it's not a concern, but when you allow 107 units, not 100, there's 107 units on that plan you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| That's an extra 1,070 traffic trips a day on those roads that cannot handle the traffic as it exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:39| My name is Raj Sood, 2728 Sood Road in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| Yes, I did call Mr. Humphries a week ago Saturday, asked him to come to my office and talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| It's very close to his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| I waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| He did not call all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I would have talked to him about several things, the density as well as the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| The main item was a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| That's what he complained about at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| So I was going to show him the proposed road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| He did not call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| I saw him today around 2.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| He said he was too busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| I feel like he could have at least called me back and made alter your arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| I have made an effort to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| You'll have to let me finish, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Mr. Holifield has talked to all the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| He will speak next if you allow him to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Mr. Humphries is not a surrounding neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| He lives about approximately one mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| We have worked with all the surrounding neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| We've worked with the commissioners from the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| We've done everything possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Mr. Holifield would like to get the resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| He has to have triple bypass surgery, and he wants this resolved before he goes under the knife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| And so his estate is settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| So we would like to resolve this matter today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| And I would like Mr. Holifield to speak now if you will so allow him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| He has about a minute and a half left on the name and address there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3537)|
| 0:59:06| I'm Donnelly Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| I live right now presently at 1301 East Moody Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| The property in question has been in my family, like I say, for 85 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| Mr. Humphries here, let me get off this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Mr. Humphries here has an ulterior agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| I have no idea what his agenda is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| In my estimation, I've had other contractors trying to buy my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| and they tried to buy my property for $5,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| I wouldn't sell it to them, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| To my estimation, the way I look at things, Mr. Humphries here has an agenda with some contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| that's trying to get my property for nothing, and I do not intend to sell it to nobody for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| And it just irritates me that he comes up here with this feeble attempt to stop what I'm trying to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| Like I say, I've got to have triple bypass surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Dr. Briggs over here is going to be the one performing my triple bypass surgery, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| And I've got to get this settled so I can get my heart taken care of and my problems taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:15| And I appreciate any help I can get from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| And Mr. Sudd does need the 9.75 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| It won't affect what I'm going to get out of the property, but he needs the potential of having to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:33| Whether he gets it approved by MPC or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| But the potential should be there to give him the opportunity to present 9.75 units per acre that we agree to with Mr. Norman over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| And without that, it wouldn't be a viable situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| The man needs to be viable where he can manipulate, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| So that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| That's all I've got to say, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| No, a minute's rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| You need to thank me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| I spoke to Mr. Sudd outside and it was right when you guys were doing the starting the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| And if you can ask Mr. Harmon or Mr. Norman, I went and interviewed with them for the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| So I came in here to see if maybe I got nominated or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| That's not the reason I rushed in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| He told me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| He could have stopped and talked to me out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| He chose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Oh, yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I stopped and talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| And as far as working for another developer or something, sir, I do commercial work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| I don't do residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| I don't work for any other developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And this is the second time I have been accused of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| I was accused of it at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| And I take offense to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| I do not work for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I have no hidden agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| The only agenda I have is that I have a safe ride to work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| I pass through that intersection at least four times a day that they're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| I had somebody throw a pipe wrench at me the other day because yet I was still on the pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| but I got close to the road and he was working on the edge of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| So, yes, I do have concerns with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| I am for a safe and sound development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| That's what I'm for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| We don't have a lot of issues like this in the third district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| so I hope I haven't butchered it up too bad in my involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| It is kind of a complex piece of land that still – there are several issues involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:45| One, it hadn't been surveyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| We don't know exactly the size of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| so it's difficult to determine density when you don't have a precise survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| There's a number of issues, environmental issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| One, steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| There's a boggy area on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| And in the process of discussing what to do and how to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| and how to best accommodate Mr. Holifield and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| we were trying to allow him to increase density in certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| so he could stay off the environmentally sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| Now, that presents a problem when you start to increase density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| and then take it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| and they look at it as if it gives them license in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| and I think that's what Mr. Humphreys is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| Then the MPC could say, well, we could develop this at the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| the same higher density all over the whole area that encompasses the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| and that's a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| That is a danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| So there's several issues here, and in the process, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| Mr. Humphreys is agitated about what's taking place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| and I don't know about the issues of who was notified what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| and didn't get to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Obviously, he didn't get to participate in a satisfactory way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| or he wouldn't be here the way he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| So these are all issues, and I think in deference to, and you see the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:30| Well, it just disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| You see the map, and you see how heavily developed the area is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| and heavily developed in terms of single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| and then up the ridge that's above the platted area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| or the area that's outlined right there that's pretty dense as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| So lots of issues related to traffic, as Mr. Humphreys brought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| There's some question about the proposed improvements to the roads that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:07| They're that T-shaped thing where all three parcels would be adjoining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| So there's still a number of things, and in deference to Mr. Humphreys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| I think maybe what the best thing to do without beating you all to death on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| any more than this is just to defer it 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| And so I'm going to make a motion to defer it for 30 days and see if we can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| And, of course, if Dr. Briggs thinks that's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| and looks like he'll make it 30 days, I think he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| We'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| That would be my motion, defer for 30 days and see if we can work this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| in a little better way from Mr. Humphreys and to all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| I guess I'd like to ask the developer if they could meet with Mr. Humphreys in the 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| and come up with maybe a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| You'll have to return my calls to meet me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| But I think Mr. Norman and myself would like to be involved in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| So when we get it set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Well, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Just one of you at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| We'll call the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| We'll sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Oh, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| We might when the sun's down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3979)|
| 1:06:30| Do you have something else, Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| I just want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Is it sometimes there's very significant financial implications to when we delay things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| And is that an instance right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| I mean, because sometimes it does cost people a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| And I'm just wondering, is that an issue here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Do you want to get on with the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| What's the situation with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Yes, both of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Again, we finished the building north of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| I would like to get a project lined up for my employees to have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| Secondly, it really is Mr. Holyfield's health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| He's worked in Oak Ridge machining uranium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| He has diabetes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| He needs cataract surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| He needs triple bypass surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| He just wants to have it resolved, his estate resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| He's in poor health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| And it's really more of that than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| You know, financially, it's really more for him financially than me financially, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| I just feel like 30 days from now we're going to be back to this same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| He did not make an effort to call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| His 15 minutes of fame for Mr. Humphreys is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| I want to make sure that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Arthur, I guess you are the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| As I look at the map, up to the north there, you already have developed, is it townhomes at 12 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| So you already have townhomes there and you've gotten 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| There are 200 that have been built, townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| And so this property is adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| So it's going to be kind of there with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| I mean, it's not as if you're going to be out there by yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| This is an extension, basically, as I look at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| And you said that you have gone to the people who live around the area and you have talked with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| and they don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| Mr. Holifield, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Mr. Holifield has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Mr. Holifield has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| There were two other people that came to the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| They discussed it with Mr. Sood at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| They had an issue on drainage, and after drainage they made a statement at the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| that they were satisfied with his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| Now, you're asking for up to 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| So after you look at it, I think Commissioner Norman had said there were some issues with the land and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| After you've surveyed it and done all of the things that you do, it might not be 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| It might be 9.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| It might be somewhere in, I mean, it's up to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| That's the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| As I put it, it gives the developer an opportunity to plan up to that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| but it does not give him the right to do up to that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| And the existing townhomes are zoned at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| They were actually built out at 10 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| I rarely see a developer that can meet the upper limit of the density requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:43| So, yes, it's a process of engineering, permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| He'll have to get permits from TDAC on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| He will have to get innumerable permits after he negotiates on the concept plan with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4193)|
| 1:10:04| And I understood Mr. Humphreys primarily to be concerned, and this was a conversation well over a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| he wanted to look at the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| That's when you get into the issues with Knox County roads, what kind of roads they want in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:24| He'll probably, well, he'll have to do a traffic study that will have to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| So there's a very lengthy process from this point before any work, any dirt is moved out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:39| I'm just trying to read the tea leaves here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Do you think that if you meet with your opposition that you're going to be able to work this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| I have no earthly idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| I think of myself as persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| Well, perhaps our commissioners in the third district could be persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| I'm always optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| I'm not sure you can work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| Looking at Mr. Sood's conceptual lightweight, I know he's not tied to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| but something Commissioner Norman said that I guess does strike me in that once we give approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| I guess we give kind of carte blanche approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| So question to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| It looks like they're not going to build on, if you look at those as three parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| the one in the southwest and one southernmost to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| it looks as though they're not going to build on over half of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| probably because of slope, because it's a topo map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| Is there anything that we can do to, because what I don't want to happen is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4308)|
| 1:11:54| I kind of understand this need to compress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| but if we give a blanket approval either this month or next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| is there any other hooks we can put in there to stop development in that quadrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| which it seems like he's agreed to do at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| I think if you add the conditions suggested by Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| that he not build on slope over 25 percent in addition to the other two, that that adds to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| Plus make this concept plan, and it's a sketch concept plan, as part of the record here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| he would have a difficult time coming in with something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Yeah, I don't know if this is answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| We'd be very uncomfortable to sit here and say that this is a plan that we could improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| At the same time, we'd be uncomfortable saying this is a plan we would deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| We really have not gotten into the review in detail of a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| That would be the next step, regardless of the density that's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| And I guess if you're asking for us to kind of give an initial response to the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| I don't think we're in a position to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| You know, we need to see something in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We need to see traffic numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| We need to see a whole array of information that we would get at a site plan stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| before we could even say that this would work or any other site plan would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| And my last question is, what was MPC's driver for the 7.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| It sounds like five was number first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| Now, what was the driver for 7.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| I think they were taking into consideration the factors that you had an area that had a mix of residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| It's predominantly, if you look at the entire area, surrounding area, it's predominantly single family detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| You do have the development to the north that the Sood family has been involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| that's developed at ten dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| They looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| They looked at, in considering the condition that we don't allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| that we wait until we have site plan approval before we allow site disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| that we look at a certain type of development of townhomes with no more than two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| And then also, to a certain degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| looking at the factors that the staff had outlined in terms of some possible traffic concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| and the topographic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| They looked at all of that to come up with what I think can easily be considered a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| between the five that the staff recommended and the ten that the applicant wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| So they looked at all of those factors in arriving at that hard number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Mr. Sood, you haven't actually bought this property yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| So your purchase price is going to depend upon how many units per acre you can get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| Well, Mr. Holifield has a set price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| It's a question of whether I buy it or do not buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Depending on how many units per acre you can get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I need 9.75 to make the project financially feasible or I just won't buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| I'm not saying that as some kind of threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| I mean, we're just here asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| But it's a question of do I buy it or do not buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| It's not a question of price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Mr. Holifield wants a set price and it's not negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| And so in order for me to purchase it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| I would like the opportunity to attempt to put 9.75 units per acre on the property to make it financially feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| or I will not purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| It's not a question of do we go back and negotiate a lower price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| We have a contract for a set price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| Even though didn't Mr. Seymour, didn't you say that developers rarely go up to that top number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| With property like this, I would be surprised if he would get 9.75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| but he's going to try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Mr. Seward has developed numerous pieces of property around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| He knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| But you're saying that if you don't get 9.75 units per acre on it, you can't afford to buy it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| He's got to have the opportunity to get 9.75 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Well, there's a difference between the opportunity and that he needs to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| Well, he hasn't done any engineering on site work, which is an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| Road work, what the road budget will be for the project, what TDEC will require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| He has a general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| He can probably explain how he goes through his numbers a lot better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| Well, honestly, it sounds to me like maybe a little more work needs to be done before those numbers are thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| And I have tremendous sympathy for the situation that you're both in with banking and with health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| But it sounds to me like a little more work needs to be done before this comes before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| And also I think it would be great if you all had an opportunity to try to work things out with your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| We don't have any trouble trying to work things out with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| The problem, and Mr. Seward can explain this, the money really starts getting spent between now and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:43| And that's when you've got to do your traffic study, start work on your TDEC permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| start work on a detailed concept plan showing what you can do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:57| What he has spent now in earnest money and limited engineering is minor compared to what he would have to spend at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4677)|
| 1:18:08| And Raj, you may want to explain the economics a little better than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| Just basically, ma'am, unless you know that you have the zoning, you really can't spend money on detailed engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| unless you know that you have the opportunity to strive for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| That's the next step is because plan residential requires use on a view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| we would start getting the drawings ready for a use on a view submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| And then once that's approved, then we would close on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| because at that point we know exactly how many units we would be allowed to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| Concerning the survey, 9.75, if the survey comes in under less than 11.44 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| which is the KGIS calculated acreage, then of course the units go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| So the density is multiplied by the acreage to come up with the total number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4734)|
| 1:19:01| So really the lack of a survey, it's close per KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| But there's quite a lot of engineering involved in the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| but you can't go there unless we have approval from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| And you wouldn't want to spend the money unless you know that you had some kind of approval from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| It would just be gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| You know, it's issues like these that I lose sleep over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| I mean, I really do, and I know a lot of us have different views on property rights here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| but this man and his family have paid taxes on this property for 85 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| For 85 years he's been a good citizen and he's paid his taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| And now he's getting up in age and he's sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| You can look at him and you can tell that he's not doing that well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| and I'm honestly not doing that well because how do we sit on this ivory tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| and we make judgment of a building project at stage one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| This gentleman's issues with the roads, of course they're going to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| This is a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| It's going to have to be a road plan as part of the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| This is step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| This is start, where we say you can have up to 9.7 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| Now, it's probably not going to wind up being 9.75 units per acre by the time we get to finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| but Mr. Sood needs this at the start because he knows that there's going to be topographical issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| there's going to be road issues that are going to chisel away at this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| We don't own this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| We've been collecting taxes on this land for 85 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| This is a building project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| It's going to help provide jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Now, you have no idea how many calls I get from people, from family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| saying can you help me get a county job because the economy's bad and people are hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| Well, now we have an opportunity to allow a man his God-given right to sell his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| and retire and make some peace with his finances before he undergoes a very invasive surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:34| We have the opportunity to allow him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| We have the opportunity to allow Mr. Sood to pursue a project that's going to provide much-needed jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| to the people of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Unemployment is about to hit double digits, yet we sit upon our ivory towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| and we worry about environmental issues and we think we're so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| We think we're so great, and I'm guilty of this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| because we can go out and get a few people to vote for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| We're just human beings like anybody else, and whenever I have the opportunity, I'm going to stand up for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| I'm going to stand up for jobs, and I'm going to stand up for property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| and I don't know if I'll get a second, but I'm going to make the motion that we approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| because this is square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| If we were playing Monopoly, this is the first square on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| It's going to be vetted through the MPC as the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| This is a planned unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| We only have one person here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| It would be different if we had 50 out here, but we have one gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| and I'm sure you may have a good reason for opposing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| You say it's the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| That's going to be dealt with in the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| And, sir, you work in this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| You know how tough times are, but we have the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| We have one guy complaining, balancing a man's property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| balancing a man's ability to set his estate, to settle it, before he undergoes a very invasive surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| My mother's had that surgery, and so I know how invasive it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| And we also balance the amount of jobs that are going to be created by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| So I'm not sure if I'm going to get a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| but I make the motion that we approve this today at 9.7 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| and that we trust the process and we know that the MPC and we know that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| and we know that the neighbor throughout the planning process will work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| I make the motion that we accept this at 9.75 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| I think we already have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| He said it was a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| He said substitute it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Does he get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| Who was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| I'll second it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| It don't make any difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| Commissioner Nauman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:13| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| Well, I guess, first of all, Mr. Lambert and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:26| in terms of what we think is right a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| And I understand property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| And I understand a couple other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| One, it's just, you know, it has been in the past somewhat deferential for commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| to defer or to acknowledge the will of the seated commissioners of which we are, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5084)|
| 1:24:54| in agreement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| But, nevertheless, I do want to make the statement that this land is going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| Now, more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| I know that Mr. Sood says that this is not a negotiated price necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| I feel like because of the community and what I know about the community and its density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| it would be in our best interest to look at it a bit longer, a bit more carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| I acknowledge that the MPC is somewhat of a gateway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| I wish it was as much of a gateway, a protective gateway, as MPC staff is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| And so just because of caution and because of what I think we should have in deference to a community also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:55| which is not represented by one person here, I think that Mr. Humphreys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| this community is working probably on the socioeconomic scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5161)|
| 1:26:11| It's a tough area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| These people do not come to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| They don't have time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| It's a struggling area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| And I think that Mr. Humphreys is probably representing a lot of people that just wouldn't be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| don't know about it, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| They don't have their radar up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| And so I want to accommodate Mr. Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| I'm sensitive enough to his concerns that I'm willing to up the density from the recommended MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| I'm the one that worked that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| I think that's a good thing for us to do to keep us off some sensitive areas on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| And I think it can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| And so that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| Commissioner Henders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Mr. Johnson, when we protect slopes, what's the normal grade that we protect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| When we protect a slope for a building, what's the normal slope that we protect degrees-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| We're very concerned about anything above 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| We try to keep as much off of that as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| Between 15% and 25%, we're less concerned, but we try to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| There are more ways you can work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| Obviously, the better part of a site that's less than 50% is where most of the development should be concentrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Commissioner Norman, I just have a question if you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| The two issues that were brought up were slope protection and traffic, and both of those were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| What do you see coming up that would be more prevalent than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| Well, there is some question about how the traffic issue is going to be resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| if the plans that have been proposed for that intersection are adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| and what else might be involved given the density, if we increase the density, the number of trips, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| So those are still some fuzzy areas that I think we ought to look at a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| And then the slope issue is there, and then there's another environmentally sensitive area that's on the lower side of one of the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:25| Well, I think any development, I mean, I used to travel the Woodsmith-Benard intersection quite a bit at work, and it's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5305)|
| 1:28:34| So any development is going to require road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I mean, that's needless to say if it's a single family or multiple family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| I just, with the compromises that have already been made, I'm trying to understand the postponements going to bring us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5322)|
| 1:28:50| what else is there to compromise on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| I'm just wondering, what in your mind do you hope to achieve through negotiation that you haven't already achieved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| I thought, you know, the 25% slope eliminates half of one of the parcels, which I think is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| I think slope protection is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I just, what else do you hope to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Well, I don't know that we'll accomplish anything, but I do want to accommodate his concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| and I don't think that they've been addressed on short notice this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| He wasn't included in our conversations before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| so if we had a meeting with him present in the room with Commissioner Harmon and I and the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:33| I think that's just a more suitable setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| And indeed, we may come back next month with exactly the same density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| but we've at least tried to work it out, and that's the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| I guess, I mean, this is your district, and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| He was at MPC, and he knew what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| and I just, I find it difficult that we've made these compromises in good faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| and then now we're going to delay it because something else is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| and we're not expecting to gain anything else in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| But see, this is different from what MPC recommended, and so that's what has Mr. Humphrey's upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| When he left MPC, he had seven units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| Now he's got 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| So I understand his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| That's what I'm trying to accommodate with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| Commissioner, excuse me, Ivan, Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| I guess I get concerned when we talk about slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| and, you know, you drive up 640 and you look at the right side of 640| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| and look at what they've done to Sharp Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| and they've put some condos or apartments on the side of those ridges that are straight up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| Now, who approved those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| I don't remember voting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I'm sure we probably did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| It might have slipped through the cracks or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| I came in here with the attitude I was going to vote for 9.75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| and me and Tony talked to the builder and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| and we wanted to see if we could work something out with Mr. Humphrey's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| I'm still going to vote for 9.75, and it ain't nothing I don't know about that can change my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| except to make sure that they don't build on the slopes that maybe the houses shouldn't be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| I went along with Tony here because I felt like we needed to at least give the gentleman a chance to talk to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| because he kept saying he didn't get a chance to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| I feel like that he probably didn't return the calls like he should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| Maybe he was too busy working or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| But if Mr. Hsu would give us a chance to meet one day next week or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| I'm still going to go with 9.75 unless somebody can change my mind in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| So I'll go along with the majority, but that's my feelings about slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| You know, we cry about some slopes when you look up what they've done to Sharp Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| We need to cry about them all, not just one little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| One of the big things that we've talked about goes back to there are two sides to this story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| There's someone who's going to be satisfied and there's someone who's going to be dissatisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| If we had broken off on this about an hour ago and said we were going to deal with it next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| probably it would have been okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| But what's happened is we've discussed it at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| and I think we've got to the point where we think the density is probably the larger number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| The problem that we have is that we've not really asked the question since we've discussed it so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| We haven't really asked the question about what will the 30 days now get us that we haven't discussed already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:44| Except, Mr. Humphrey, is there any room for you to change anything you think now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:54| after having heard us sit and bicker about it for an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| I can tell you right now this is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| I'm ready to come fight this because, like Mr. Lambert says, I do work for developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| I work for commercial developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| Development is hard right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I've told him before I know this property is going to develop, but I want a safe and sound development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| I want something, you know, the concept plan that I've seen there shows one entrance pretty much off of each of these parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| One of them even shows it being difficult to get a fire truck down to one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| You know, I know this is just real concept, you know, pencil drawings and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| but, you know, if you're going to bring something like this, you might want to take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| and not have people like me look at it and say, hey, look, if he plans on doing this, this isn't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| I mean, I just, you know, to come in and have to find out from the Metropolitan Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| that he's going to be requesting, you know, they told me 10 units per acre, not 9, 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5633)|
| 1:34:00| And to find out after I leave here, after, you know, you guys voted on earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| and I go up to talk to a couple of staff members about a plot I got up there and I find this out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| this is what got to me, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| As long as he limits it to two-story townhomes, you know, he's going to be limited on the area he can build if you limit the slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| But the fact to come in and try to, the lack of a better word than I can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| try to sneak in 10 units per acre when the staff approved 7.5, you know, there's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:33| I mean, you do understand that this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Just a second, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| No, you've got the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Well, I was finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| The question that I asked was, do you think there's going to be any difference in your opinion or position next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:54| as opposed to right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| And let me back up just a second and get you to disregard the statement about getting a fire truck on a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| That's going to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Oh, I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Like I said, I do this for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| So back to my question as I brought you up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| do you think there will be any difference between your opinion of the project 30 days from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| as opposed to your opinion of the project today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| It depends on what they have to say to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| I think we've said that over the last couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Well, and I've also been accused of working for other developers and stuff like this on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| Yeah, no, you haven't, but these guys have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| And I don't work for anybody but myself on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| I have taken a day of vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Please focus with me on the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| do you think there will be any difference between what you think of the project a month from now as opposed to right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| Yes, with sit down, meet me, explain to me what you're wanting to do instead of just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| That's been described to you over the last hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| No, it's been described in certain areas but not overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you, sir, for your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| This leads me to a dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| What has happened is that we seem to have arrived at an impasse in which we know what should happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:20| but we have one person that opposes what's going to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| And we also, I think, hear from that person that they're opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| no matter whether we talk about it today or whether we talk about it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| But having said all of that, my position on this is going to be to defer to the commissioner whose district this is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:50| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Buzz, if we were to approve this tonight, no matter what we approve tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| the concept plan would still go before MPC, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| And would this gentleman have a chance to argue his opinion at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| During the concept phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| I would have the right to argue everything but density only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Except for density only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| So the points that he's bringing up tonight about whether or not you could bring a fire truck, ingress, the layout, slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:32| all that, he would still have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| The only thing he couldn't argue at that point would be the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| He could not argue the density established through rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| But if it were a density problem due to maybe safety issues or something, then that could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:53| Or the design of how the layout of these townhomes were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Parking lot, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Things that we don't know about at this point in time until we actually see a site plan with all of the information that's required to be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:14| And, Mr. Sood, in a month's time, I mean, are you going to have that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| or are you going to wait until you get your rezoning to even start spending money on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| I cannot pay for any more engineering work until we know that we have approval from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| Then we will prepare a use on review submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| Did I answer your question, Mr. Luthone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| I mean, because I still get back to the same question everybody's asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| What are we going to know between now and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Because I don't think that you're going to be able to provide this gentleman with the information that he's going to want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| I mean, are you going to be able to maybe offer him some explanation, a layout better than what this plan shows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| Everything he's asking will go through the use on review process with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| Everything he's brought up will go through that process and be answered then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| And, of course, the stock gates will be MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| After that, it will be the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| It will be Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| That's part of the next process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:22| Unfortunately, it's a step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| And this concept plan really is more than most developers would do at this stage just to know if they've got the zoning or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| You said that you had to have the 9.75 or the opportunity to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| Is your contract contingent upon a certain number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Because what if you get your zoning tonight, but through the concept stage you can only get eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:57| Would you still have to purchase at that price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| Or could you at that point say, well, I can't make it work because I can't get that many units in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| The contract has a due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| And at the end of that due diligence period, I either have to decide to buy the property or not to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| And I put in 150 days for that, which would give us time to get through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| So the answer is I would not have to buy the property if I could go in and get eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| That doesn't mean I won't buy it, but I would not have to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| You look frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| You brought up the fact that if you couldn't get your zoning, you were not interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| But if you can get, because you realize, and I think everybody realizes that you're probably going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| by the time you go through the concept, you're probably not going to get the 9.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| You may get something close, but it may be substantially less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| And I'm just wondering if two or three months from now as you're going through the concept phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| and you're getting something less, then are you still going to be able to buy this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| Because I'm sitting here trying to think of, you know, how do we get past this impasse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| Is there a compromised number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Would you accept nine units an acre today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| The concept plan in front of you was prepared by me and a licensed professional engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| And I feel confident we'd be very close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| You think you'd get close to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I believe we can get exactly as shown on that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| But you're not going to spend any more engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| so this gentleman is not going to have any more information a month from now than what he's going to have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| All his issues are technical issues that really go through a more advanced stage through the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| It would be foolish to spend money on a maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| I'd be spending money on a maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| I appreciate what Tony and Ivan have tried to do in trying to work with this in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6122)|
| 1:42:11| I still think that there is ‑‑I would still like to see an effort made to try to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:20| I don't think ‑‑ well, I'll refrain from ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| well, I think that you boys have behaved badly on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| and I want to give you an opportunity to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| So that's my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| I'm not in favor of 9.75 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| I'm not in favor of going above what MPC has recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| because that's even above what MPC staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| So I want to give you all an opportunity to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| I want to give you an opportunity to make money on your development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| and I want to give you an opportunity to make money on selling your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| So I think that if you four get together with your two commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| you may be able to accomplish all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| I just want to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| Let me ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| I don't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| I'm not seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| I just need to either make a disclosure or recuse myself in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| because I'm related to Oliverville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| If someone has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to point out that under the rules in section ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| Rule seven, section ‑‑ I'm sorry, rule eight on rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| and appeals, section D, following ‑‑ this is the commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:55| As I understand it, the substitute motion is to approve the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| And the rules say that following denial by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| no rezoning request, appeal, or subdivision plan approval request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| may be resubmitted for a period of at least 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| provided, however, a petition for a different zoning would be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| So under this rule, if the substitute motion is defeated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| then unless this body suspends its rules, which it can by a two‑thirds vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| this matter can't come back up again for 12 months unless it's a different zoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| We can't even get to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Mr. Law Director, under the circumstances, I'm going to withdraw my substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| but I want to tell you this is we had an opportunity here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| to help ease a sick person's mind before they undergo this surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| I think the commissioners in the district have worked really hard on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| and I think they've got things worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| They worked out a great compromise, and I just wish that we could keep it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| But in the interest of that I don't want to hurt this poor gentleman any more than he already is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| and I'll tell you, I mean, I'm probably a little more sensitive to this than a lot of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| but I can't sleep nights after we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| This man owns this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| This man's paid taxes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| And how we can sit up in our ivory towers and sit in judgment of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:36| as desperate as this town is for work, I mean, like I said, I can't sleep nights after these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| And I'm going to withdraw it because I'm not sure if the votes are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| but I just hate that we can't put this man at ease before he undergoes this surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| And, sir, I'm going to be praying for you, and I'm going to be praying for these folks here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| because sometimes I think in doing the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| and reading their politically correct environmental literature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| sometimes I think some of us lose their hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| And so, sir, I'm going to be praying for you and your surgery, and I'm going to be praying for us too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| Commissioner Norman, do you still want to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| If there's no other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| I think he wants to say something, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Oh, is Mr. Alfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| Let's let Mr. Alfield talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| I have put this off since December to get this heart surgery so I can get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:41| I'm trying to help Mr. Sudd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| Jim and I can't wait no longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| I've got to have heart surgery and I'm trying to take care of all my business before I have the heart surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| Now, 30 days, all you're going to do is extend what I've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| Either do it or don't do it, but don't put me on hold like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| I paid my taxes for the 22 years I've had the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| Now, I don't see no reason why that I have to go through this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| I just lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| I apologize for my indifference, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Hold on, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Commissioner Norman has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| Mr. Alfield, we've talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| It's fully intended to come here and allow you the density that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| I just feel like I really feel like the community, that I've got to represent the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:48| I do understand your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| And I really feel in my conscience that we've got to step back for 30 days and look at this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| We may not, it may have no effect whatsoever on the deal that gets worked out for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| but I truly feel like that's in the best interest of all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| I don't think that you'll change Mr. Humphrey's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| I think Mr. Humphrey will have the same complaint 30 days from now that he's got now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| I don't think he'll change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| He'll propose what he wants to propose, but I don't think the man will ever change his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| He's done the same spiel at the NPC meeting as he's doing right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| Now, you can go ahead and postpone it 30 days, but he'll come up with the same thing in 30 days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| And when you have a meeting with him, you'll come up with the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| He's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Well, he may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| We're going to try to get our heads together and see if we can work out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| But I really feel we need to do this for all parties concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| And I feel like the community is woefully unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| It's unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| Now, you've done this once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| We don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| You got yourself in trouble with Cynthia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Now you did it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| Go ahead, Mr. Hoffield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| If you had more people coming up here to complain about this, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| one is not a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| If I had the people that I've already talked to around my property come up here, then they would have the complaint, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| Mr. Humphrey lives one mile from this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| He works in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| He goes down Woodsmith Road to catch McCamey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| But that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6596)|
| 1:49:58| My point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| If you had ten people come up here and complain about this property being in the condition it is, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| I could really understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| But for one man to come up and raise all this cane and stir up this and then get postponed 30 days, I just don't buy it, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:19| I understand, Mr. Hoffield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6619)|

| 1:50:29| And I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| And you know I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| But I also really do think that we've got to sit down with him and give him his time and see if we can work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6633)|
| 1:50:43| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| If you don't get his cooperation, are you going to try to reduce the amount of units per unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| I don't see any necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6651)|

| 1:51:05| I'm getting upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| Very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| I just wanted to say on the record what I said off the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| I said, sir, you have no list of petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| I said, it looks to me like you're one guy up here hurting this old man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| And I said, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| And I say that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| What did you say before that about my dad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6684)|

| 1:55:03| Here, Mr. Chairman. John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee 37901 on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:14| I don't know that you all necessarily remember, but about, I guess, maybe three months or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| this matter was sent back down to MPC to reevaluate and give a recommendation on office as a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:33| and OA, well, office for zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| It went back to MPC. Staff recommended approval for office as far as the sector plan is concerned and for OA for the zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:49| At MPC, the neighborhood representative, I cannot recall the gentleman's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:57| Buzz then may have it, but he appeared and spoke in support of the office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| That's what MPC did was to approve office and slope protection on the plan amendment and OA zoning on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6962)|
| 1:56:10| That's what I'd ask this body to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| Mr. King, what was the proposed that we pulled and it went back up to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:22| What was that proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| Well, we initially had asked for commercial zoning and it had to do with, he really wanted to build an office there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:32| but he was going to be showing sample product for selection in residential development, furniture, items, carpeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:42| you know, tile samples and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| You couldn't really do that in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| We had a long discussion and lots of discussions with neighborhood representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| We let the air clear for a while, went back and had some more discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| And the result of that was he finally just abandoned the idea of trying to do that and just going to use it straight as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7016)|
| 1:57:03| Is this going to be similar to what Mr. Revesz has just a quarter of a mile or so down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| Similar, not the condos behind it, but the offices in the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| There will probably be, Mr. Cox, Winston Cox is the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| One of the offices there is going to be his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Right now the issue is whether there will be one building or two buildings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| But in any event, one of the offices will be his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| And that was what we were originally, why we were looking at the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7052)|

| 1:57:38| On both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Have we asked for neighborhood opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| Is there anyone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| There is in the record, and I would note there is substantial in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7067)|

| 1:58:16| It's a request of J.L. Turner for rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| The property is located on the north side of Ebenezer Oaks Lane, east of Ebenezer Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| This is one that actually came up several months ago and was deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| and the citizens and the developer worked it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| and I would move for approval as of the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| For MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Information is shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| I want to take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| I want to say that I'm getting ready to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| Before you leave, Tank, Commissioner Norman has made a suggestion of having a prayer vigil for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:29| for the operation that you're going to be having at the end of the week here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| I set it up because I felt like it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| You mean a lot to this commission, to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| Your leadership is very well appreciated, far beyond, I think, what's in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:51| And although I know you said you can't make it Thursday morning at 730,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| I want you to know before you leave that our prayers are with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| and we just want to make sure that everything is all right, and I believe it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:12| But like you say, it never hurts to ask God for that kind of help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:20| and I'm sure that everybody here wishes Godspeed to you and a quick recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7220)|
| 2:00:28| And you will be in I Know Mine and everybody else's thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| Well, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| And, again, I know you've read in the paper that the way that Alvis came down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| a lovely person I didn't know offered me her kidney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7257)|
| 2:01:04| and I believe that God set Alvis up the way we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| So I always believe that when God sets something up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| that it will be taken care of in a good manner, that everything will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:21| Thank you for your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| I'm asking everyone to pray for me in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| And the operation will be Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| I have to go into the hospital Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| They want me to have a lot of rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| That's the reason I think I need to leave, because I think you're all going to be here for another long period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| and I don't think I can withstand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| Dr. Briggs will tell you that I probably need rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| So thank you for your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| Thank you for everything you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| And, yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| Tank, I'd also like to let you know that tomorrow we've set up a blood drive here at the city county building in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. in honor of you and your donor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| So hopefully medic will get a lot of donations tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7330)|
| 2:02:11| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| We just set it up this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| What are the times on that, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. here in the large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| Tank, before you go, too, I'd like to just say that and thank you, Craig, for setting that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| I'm sure that they'll be most of the commission will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| I'm sure that there's a lot of public folks that just know about you and value you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:37| and appreciate your work and appreciate who you are, the kind of person you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| They'll be here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| And, of course, we're going to be praying for Ms. What is her last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:50| Beverly Mulhollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| Mulhollow, Ms. Mulhollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| Indeed, this is kind of a miraculous thing in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| And when you go into surgeries like this, it's a very difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| We know it's a difficult surgery, and we've got some strong people here on this body, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:15| that are spiritually very strong, just like in your church, that are going to be praying for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| And you're going to be in fine shape, and you're going to be out kicking some folks around here before long, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| One other thing, Commissioner Norman, could you maybe set it up for cable TV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7409)|
| 2:03:37| That's what I was going to ask, Craig, if you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| Because I tried to get out of dialysis Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| They wouldn't let me, so I can watch it on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| You can get it set up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Jolie will get that set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| I can at least watch it on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| You'd be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| Do we have a ten-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| Well, we've got a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| Okay, we're going to get started here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| We're on discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| We're going to pick it right up where we left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Discussion of recent charter amendments and responsibilities of county officials regarding conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:22| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| Yes, Mr. Chairman, very basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| When the voters approved the charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| not only did they approve reducing commission from 19 to 11 and the two at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| there was also a conflict of interest provision, and there was also a provision, I believe, on nepotism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| I just want to ask our law director, if he would, at our next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| prepare for us just a summary of our responsibilities under that charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| to make sure that we're complying fully with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| Mr. Saunders, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| Did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| Did anybody else have anything they want to add to this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| Discussion concerning Chairman Strickland's kidney transplant procedure schedule for Friday, March 27, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:14| We pretty much covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| I think we covered it, but I just wanted to make sure that Mr. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| I wanted to add that I'm going to donate out of my discretionary funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:28| to the local chapter of the National Kidney Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| and I would like to encourage the other commissioners who have discretionary funds available that they do likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:42| And anyone else who would like to make contributions can make them through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| Of course, we'll have to follow our new procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| Yes, but I will be responsible for taking the paper out to the local chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7549)|
| 2:05:54| and explaining to them how to fill it out and bringing it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| Can we consolidate our gift that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| That's what I was just getting ready to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| Is it possible that if we just have them fill out the one form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| and then all the commissioners that want to do that just sign on to how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| Would that be suffice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| It's going to be one gift, not separate gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| One check that will come out of each commissioner who so designates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7582)|
| 2:06:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| Or has funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| And, Commissioner, how much were you wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| You're going to do $250,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| I'll match the $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| I'll match it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| And so I tell you what, everybody that would like to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| just contact Joe Lee in the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| And I think that's a good gesture and a very worthy cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:56| Okay, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| A question regarding billboard moratorium and a report by the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:12| The moratorium was put into place on October 27th to expire on March 31st of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7632)|
| 2:07:26| The request during the six months was that, at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| let me point out there was no litigation pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| The Lamar case had not been filed, I believe, against the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7654)|
| 2:07:40| One of the deputy law directors in my office has met with and been in contact with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7660)|
| 2:07:49| We've performed some independent research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| and we've concluded that the county may constitutionally regulate electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7672)|
| 2:08:03| However, due to the uncertainties in terms of what the ultimate outcome could be in the Lamar case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:17| I don't know that I can in good conscience recommend that the commission enact a total prohibition at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7697)|
| 2:08:27| or consider a total prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:35| The action that's pending by Lamar against the city was by writ of certiorari to chancery court from a denial by the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7715)|
| 2:08:49| So I would at this point recommend perhaps beginning a process, if it's the commission's will that that be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7729)|
| 2:09:06| But MPC has a substantial draft ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:15| and the county could look at that and consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| The key elements of that ordinance regulate distance from other signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7760)|
| 2:09:28| the static hold time for each image on the sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| and negotiating removal of a number of the traditional style billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:45| to substitute for the installation of one electronic billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7785)|
| 2:09:52| And so those are all things that would be part of the discussion and the debate before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7792)|
| 2:10:01| But our conclusion is that there can be constitutional regulation that passes constitutional muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7801)|
| 2:10:15| But you have to realize that if you go forward immediately and put such an ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:22| then we're going to be in court litigating that issue simply as a cost-saving measure, if nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7822)|
| 2:10:35| And since it's not really, while it's an important issue, it's not one that changes the structure of county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7835)|
| 2:10:49| you might want to wait and see what happens in the litigation by Lamar against the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7849)|
| 2:10:58| and then we'll know what we can and cannot do legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| And I won't have to worry about the cost attendant to litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:14| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| Yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| That was my resolution where we put that moratorium on for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| and I believe what the sequence was initially it was going to be a 90-day moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| until we came up with how we wanted to regulate the billboards, just as you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| And then I think it was Lamar who sued the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7892)|
| 2:11:37| and I've attended all of the city workshops on the billboards, so I'm familiar with what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| And I agree with you completely with what you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| The only thing that I would do, I don't think we should even start working on how we want to construct the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:56| until we see what the court says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| And really what I would like to do is just to put, just over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| seeing how slow the court system works, I would really propose we just put another moratorium on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| until we see what the courts say before we do any work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| And then once we get a court decision, then we can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| If it's starting to run to the end of the six-month period, we could extend it another 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7936)|
| 2:12:21| or whatever it takes to get the ordinance on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| But really what I would propose doing is just extending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| and I think we should go ahead and do that tonight if it's permitted to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| because if not, in the month it takes for us to ban these things, there will be 30 of them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:40| But not to go ahead and start a task force or doing work on it elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| I would just propose we do another six-month moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| and then if something comes up in three months, we can start working on an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| I believe that's an appropriate motion, isn't it, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| What I was getting ready to ask the law director is, can we make that in the form of a motion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| or would we have to add that before we could do that to make it proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| I think you would need to add it to the agenda by vote, and then it would be proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| Can we not suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| That's what I'm getting ready to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| That also requires a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| So either way, it's going to require a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| Before we do that, let me get to all the lights, and then I'll get back to you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Well, that's exactly what I wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| I wish to move to suspend the rules to add an item extending the billboard moratorium for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:36| Okay. Do I hear a second to the suspension of the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| We still have one more light on them, and we'll get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Basically, that was my question, but I also had one other one, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| and what Mr. Lockett said in regards to some of the things the MPC has in their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8029)|
| 2:13:56| Is there anything in there about the brightness of these signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| We've got one on Chapman Highway that lights it up all the way to Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| I can't speak to that, Commissioner, whether the proposed ordinance does or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| We need to get that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| I just want to add a quick comment that I put something on the forum yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| or the day before about the International Dark Skies Initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| and the cover article that was on National Geographic in November of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| encouraging everybody to take a look at that because it deals with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| We're going to vote on the suspension of the rules so that we can add a motion about extending the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| We have one no, and the chair is going to rule that it does pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8091)|
| 2:14:59| Sometimes this issue comes up with the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8099)|
| 2:15:04| who does an incredibly efficient and accurate job of taking the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| So oftentimes if the action that's taken doesn't reflect it's being done by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| and there's just a motion, then we can't prepare a resolution that reflects the action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| So I would ask that if a motion is made to extend the moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| that it be made saying that it's been a motion in the form of a resolution by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8125)|
| 2:15:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| A resolution of commission to extend the billboard moratorium for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8150)|
| 2:15:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Any other no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| Okay, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| Presentation regarding economic development, Innovation Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| and other activities of the Knoxville Chamber Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:13| I believe they gave a presentation twice at two, and I don't see them out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8173)|
| 2:16:19| so I think we probably can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| Before we go to the next thing, I'm going to ask for suspension of the rules again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| so we can add something to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| With the appointment of John Schoonmaker to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| he resigned from the Transfer Development Rights Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| and the fifth district now is not being represented on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| and I would like to be able to appoint someone to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| So I'm going to ask that we have a suspension of the rules so we can vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:56| so we can nominate someone to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| I'd like to nominate Jim McEver from the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8230)|
| 2:17:12| I'd second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| Do I hear any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| Do I have a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| Do we need a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| I think appointments do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| Well, I was going on the vote itself of voting on Jim McEvers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| Does it need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:44| All those in favor of Jim McEvers say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8264)|
| 2:17:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8271)|
| 2:17:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| These are ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| The first one is on page 18, 0-09-3-105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| Consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| approving amendments to the Knox County zoning ordinance or article 6, section 6.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8286)|

| 2:19:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8355)|

| 2:19:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| I got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| What kind of process are we going to use when we put something on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8395)|
| 2:19:56| I mean, what if the finance department doesn't have time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| I hate to say this, but what's the physical note at the bottom of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| Are we going to have to require them to hire another person to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| this task on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| Is it going to require or is it the responsibility of the person that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| drafts the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| We'll have to get a fiscal impact statement to determine whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| I just want to make sure that we're not adding something right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| I mean, I like having a physical note apply to that, but are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| be adding somebody to apply the physical note?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| It's my, I hate to speak for the finance department and maybe someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8429)|
| 2:20:35| else who was in the committee meetings recalls, but I think Mr. Troyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| was asked that question and he replied in the negative that it wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| require him hiring additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| Now, as far as timing, there may very well be an instance where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| come back to us and tell us that they haven't had time to do a complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| This is going to require that, you know, you bring something before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| commission that has to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| You can't add anything to the agenda because it doesn't have a physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| note attached to it the day of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| And so, I mean, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| Well, we're talking about ordinances here, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| The other two readings anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| That would be in between the two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Can I make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| What I would suggest we do is that we have an ordinance and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| necessarily attach a fiscal note to it on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| And that way the finance office doesn't put a lot of effort into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| something that's not going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| But if it passes the first reading, that would then give them a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| to attach a fiscal note to it for the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| I thought that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| I think that says prior to its final passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| So that would imply that the fiscal note could wait as long as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8509)|
| 2:21:50| So really what he's saying really wouldn't, I mean, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| something you're getting on at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| They'd almost have a two-month period to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| If you were to put on the agenda an ordinance and it passes first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| reading, and then the finance department would have to, by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| time we get to the second reading the following month, then we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| have to have that note, that fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Is that what you're trying to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| And this does have the full support of the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| I mean, that really gives them 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| They believe that this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| Did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| Commissioner Briggs, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| Commissioner Boyle, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8564)|

| 2:23:12| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| The amendment, is Mr. Jarrett here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Mr. Jarrett, could you speak to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| During the course of the last meeting, the board directed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| to explore the feasibility and legality of assessing a civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| penalty against the actual clerk who sells the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| We researched that and determined that that was, in fact, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| legality that we could, in fact, enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| As such, I inserted into your proposed ordinance penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| both punitive and penalties which are considered remedial, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| other words, designed to train and dissuade future violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8640)|
| 2:24:04| rather than punish more extensively than that which the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| state would do in the prosecutorial aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| No double jeopardies, in fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| It's not because under Tennessee law, because it is a civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| penalty designed to educate and to preclude further actions, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| is not considered a criminal penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| And as such, double jeopardy does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| Mackenzie was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| Mackenzie, would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| And I was not at last week's meeting, but are we talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| penalizing the actual teller that probably makes minimum wage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8686)|
| 2:24:53| That was discussed during intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| And I personally, I guess, have a little heartburn with that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| that, you know, there may be other mitigating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8703)|
| 2:25:10| that theoretically could have caused this teller or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| clerk to allow that beer to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8714)|
| 2:25:21| I have a little heartburn with penalizing the teller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| I don't have any heartburn with increasing the fines over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| above that $500 on the establishment owner, but to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| after the individuals after they've probably lost their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| After they've lost their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| And as you heard here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| And they have gone through a court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| They probably had to hire an attorney, pay court fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| They may have quite a bit on someone that was probably not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| making a whole lot of money to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| That was a lot of points I brought up at intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| The other thing I brought up was whether or not this would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| mandatory fine or if it would be a discretionary fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| Commissioner Norman, do you recall if we decided that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| amendment was to be left at the discretion of this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| I don't recall and I don't think we set any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| we had any set amount about the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| I know to Mr. McKenzie's point, there was discussion that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| and it seemed like the purpose was, and admittedly somebody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| is making minimum wage, it seems probably harsh, but given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| numbers of events like this, it seemed to me and to some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| on the committee that this might serve as another deterrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| But it's up to the commission whether they think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| excessive or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| If I could, Mr. Chairman, because of the conversations I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| from the board, I crafted it in such a manner, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| that it is discretionary, and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| the board has the option either A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| whether or not to do it, or B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| in the alternative to a monetary fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| require remedial training as in a remedial training class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| So the way I crafted it because of conversations of the Zilk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| one, you do have the option as to whether or not you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| even impose it, or two, in the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| rather than seeking monetary remuneration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| you can just merely require them to say take a refresher course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8849)|
| 2:27:32| But again, I'll craft it any way this board deems necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| And that point taken that it is discretionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| I think what I considered is that the owner of the establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8861)|
| 2:27:47| if he, in the process of training his servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| emphasizes the fact that they are liable from a civil standpoint as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| and they could be held, not that they would be punished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| I mean would be fined, but they could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| So I just, there were some of us that thought this was a good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| another sort of extra level that might be preventative in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:14| Mr. McKenzie, were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| One suggestion then would be how about having a tiered approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| I mean on first offense you go and be retrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| I think the courts actually have a tiered approach that you almost get one offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| and then you can get, what, the 11 months and 29 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| But if you get caught again, I think you don't even get the deferment anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8916)|
| 2:28:44| They come back and hit you pretty hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| Is that right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| Local practice here is if there is no previous criminality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| no previous criminal history and it's a first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:55| the general rule is that they're sent to a diversionary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| So they're not adjudicated guilty, instead they're diverted, they pay a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| and the case is dispensed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| First, in this case and what we're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| would that require the seller to be here in addition to the business owner at the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8955)|
| 2:29:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| The business owner is already brought before the board immediately for the fact that the sale occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| at his or her establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| But when would the seller be brought before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| The seller would be brought to you once the law enforcement makes a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8974)|
| 2:29:40| then as you saw this morning or, excuse me, this afternoon at 1 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| that's when the seller comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| This isn't designed to bring the seller back a second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| because you're actually going after the seller itself, not the holder of the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| Second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| On page 7 under section 4-5, under server training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=8996)|
| 2:30:01| the old ordinance called for 60 days from the date of hire to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:08| We have 60 in here, and I would like to see that go back to the 30 days of what it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9008)|
| 2:30:17| Is that something that could be done underneath the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9021)|
| 2:30:22| There was a debate back and forth as to what would be an appropriate time for vendors to actually get their licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9022)|
| 2:30:29| There was one argument that said essentially 30 days is ample time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9029)|
| 2:30:33| There was another argument that essentially held it was not sufficient time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9033)|
| 2:30:37| and oftentimes they missed the opportunity because of the scheduling and availability of classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9037)|
| 2:30:43| That's clearly the board's discretion if they want to do 30 or 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| Well, to me, this should be part of the hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| You know, if you have a business where you're selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| then part of this hiring process should be getting that person trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| It's just like anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| You know, if you're hiring them to train them to do a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| you're going to give them the training before you put them out on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| I don't want to go ahead and let them sell beer and then find out later I've got to train them how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9067)|
| 2:31:12| So I think the 30 days is certainly has been sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| And, again, as we talked about earlier today, we have far too many violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| and we're going to need to put the businesses and the sellers on notice that we're looking at these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9083)|
| 2:31:30| and we're going to take a harsher look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| Joe, one concern that I've got that when these people come before us, these store owners and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| one of the questions that was asked today, you know, is the person still with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| And most of the time they say, no, they've already let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| So how would we collect money like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| Have you thought about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| How would we go on something like that when they've let the employee go or just let it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| What are you thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| Well, sir, the notion of going after the seller was board initiated, but it does raise a logistical problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9121)|
| 2:32:09| The person is terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| We would have to make a concerted effort to locate their last known address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| and then actually serve them with a civil summons to bring them before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| But if that's what the board wants, we'll make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9138)|
| 2:32:23| Mr. Chairman, I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve and with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| Does that include the 30 days instead of 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| And Commissioner Smith, does that include the language that he's added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| that it's discretionary and it doesn't necessarily have to be monetary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9163)|
| 2:32:48| That's the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Yeah, one discussion that we had in my committee, and I think it was me and Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9175)|
| 2:33:02| the discussion over minimum wage employees at a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| I think that we should use a little more leniency on a convenience store employee for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9189)|
| 2:33:16| They're not making a lot of money, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| And number two, they're selling alcohol that is most likely going to be taken home to be consumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| Underage drinking at home is bad, but underage drinking in a bar or restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| where they're going to be getting on the streets is worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9212)|
| 2:33:36| So I think that the higher fines should be imposed when it's sale for consumption on premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:45| because, you know, folks in the food and beverage industry, you know, for 20-year-old college students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9225)|
| 2:33:52| those are some of the best jobs out there for folks in that age group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9232)|
| 2:33:57| And so I think that there should be higher fines for sale, you know, for on-premise consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9237)|
| 2:34:04| And that's why I agree with having leniency so that we may, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| just not impose the fine for the convenience store person on their first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9248)|
| 2:34:14| but to where we can really go after that cocktail waitress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| or bartender who has served minors on multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| I have a, along with Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9266)|
| 2:34:29| I have a heartburn with bringing the civil penalty against the seller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| because the seller went to criminal proceedings and the beer establishment did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| The seller is already out, $50 in court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9282)|
| 2:34:46| An attorney, if they hire one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| they also potentially lose their ability to sell for so many years based on state law, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9288)|
| 2:34:54| So I have heartburn with, as much as I'd love to, you know, I hate alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9294)|
| 2:35:01| So I would love to bring them all in and fine them $150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| but they've already been done that process in the criminal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| and the license holder has nothing in the criminal side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| And so I think it's unfair to bring in the seller on our side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| whenever the licensee has not been brought in on the criminal side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| But I am for, upon these laws being enacted, I am for increasing our first offense fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9319)|
| 2:35:28| I am for, if they don't check ID, we raise the fine potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| That's just kind of how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| But I do have heartburn with bringing the seller in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| because they went through the criminal process and the licensee does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:43| Yes, Mr. Anders discussed what a lot I was going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| When they go out and they make these stings, they cite the seller to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| He has to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| He's either found guilty or not guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| If he's found guilty, the judge fines him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| Then on top of that, he loses his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| He can no longer sell beer at an establishment for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| Now, that's really a staunch, that's really hard on a person that's working for minimum wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9369)|
| 2:36:15| because most all of these minimum wage jobs are little establishments, little 7-Eleven stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9375)|
| 2:36:20| things like that where they have to handle beer and sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9380)|
| 2:36:23| So we've put these people out of work for ten years already to where they stand a chance to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| Plus, they've been to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| They're the ones cited to court, not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| And the judge either fines them or lets them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| So, you know, I'm against this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| I do feel like there's something we need to do to, I guess, penalize the seller some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9400)|
| 2:36:51| but I'm against them people losing their job for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9411)|
| 2:36:54| We're putting people like that on the welfare rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| Mr. Pinkston, Mr. Law Director, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9417)|
| 2:37:03| If someone is found guilty and they're given diversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| can they get another job selling beer while they're on diversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| or do they need to wait that ten-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| Well, as Mr. Jarrett explained, depending on, obviously, diversion is discretionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9435)|
| 2:37:22| but if it's a first offense and the offense is diverted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| then they're not going to have a ten-year prohibition on selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9448)|
| 2:37:32| because diversion is if the offense never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| It's only if someone doesn't get diversion or if it's a second offense, then it's more serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9456)|
| 2:37:44| and that's when the stiffer penalty is going to come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| Mr. Pinkston, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Well, most of these people plead guilty to these things because they can't afford a lawyer or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9470)|
| 2:37:55| If you read number nine right here, it says ten years, state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9475)|
| 2:38:04| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| But what normally happens here in Knox County, even if they plead guilty, is it gets diverted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| Typically, on a first offense, if there's no other aggravating factors, that is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9496)|
| 2:38:23| The individual gets on diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| But if they get another offense, then okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| I don't have a problem with that, and I'm also wondering if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| As Mr. Jarrett said, the civil penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| and I understand Mr. Anders and Commissioner Pinkston's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9520)|
| 2:38:46| Keep in mind, it's totally discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| Discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| You're not required to assess a civil penalty against the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9529)|
| 2:38:55| It's only if you think, if this body thinks it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| And then it doesn't have to be a monetary fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| Even if you do decide, you can require them to go through the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9544)|
| 2:39:10| So it's not as if this is something that you're required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9550)|
| 2:39:15| And I'll also ask Mike if he would be willing to amend his amendment to, instead of 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9555)|
| 2:39:24| to make it that before anyone serves alcohol or sells alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| that they have to go through the server training program and not even give them 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9568)|
| 2:39:34| but they have to do it before they're allowed to serve or sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9574)|
| 2:39:37| Well, I think if I can see your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| but I believe that if we set that 30-day program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| then if everybody's on board, the business owner and the seller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| then they know they're going to have to get that thing done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| and they're basically on probation until they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9591)|
| 2:39:57| Here, again, we're talking about people who need the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| If they've got to wait another 30 days to get a paycheck, maybe they can't wait that long for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| But I think they know at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| We don't have any of the sheriff's officers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| How often do they offer this training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| It's, what, every two weeks, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| The city has one every two weeks, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| But it fills up fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I mean, there's 25 slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| But, I mean, I think the county also has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| And there's also another outfit that has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| But my point is this, that I think if we check the statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| these that are selling that they're being caught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| I don't think they're within the first 30 days of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| I think the first 30 days, you know, they're sitting on pins and needles and watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| So I don't think that that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| I just want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to keep these things from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| Mr. Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| Well, that's kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| That was one of my questions is I was going to ask, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| how difficult would it be to make sure that they were trained in this before they actually sewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| And another question is, is once they've gotten this certificate and gone through this class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:15| then if an underage from the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| they go in and are they allowed to ask for the certificate that they have completed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9679)|
| 2:41:29| when these alcohol server training things, and if it's been after 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| is there a way of holding the business accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| And if it's been over 30 days and they don't have their certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| or the store doesn't have it on file, to find the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| Yes, ma'am, on all counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| The beer inspector, they have to display it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| It has to be produced immediately upon request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| If they don't comply, they come before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| and the board can, if they're not a responsible vendor, revoke their license immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9716)|
| 2:42:03| Commissioner Broyles, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| I just want to make sure you didn't have any further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| Now, the motion is to approve it with the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| but the 30 days instead of 60 days in order to get the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| All right, is everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9742)|

| 2:42:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9744)|
| 2:42:25| All right, let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9748)|

| 2:42:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9754)|
| 2:42:35| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9755)|

| 2:44:28| This is ordinance 0-09-2-102, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9868)|
| 2:44:35| establishing lobbyist registration and disclosure requirement, Knox County Code, Part 2, Chapter 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:42| establishing Article 13, Section 2-921, and this is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9882)|
| 2:44:49| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9889)|

| 2:44:55| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Mr. King, if you'll identify yourself by name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| Mr. Acting Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9906)|
| 2:45:17| and I'm here to speak in reference to this proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9917)|
| 2:45:24| This evening has been successful on your part, for sure, and one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9924)|
| 2:45:29| I told a number of other people who were here earlier that we're going to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| It's long since gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| I guess I'm just stubborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9934)|
| 2:45:39| I left here after last month's meeting and set about to convince myself not to speak on this ordinance again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9939)|
| 2:45:50| I read Sunday's paper, and despite my persuasive power, I was unable to convince myself not to speak on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9950)|
| 2:46:02| I read in the paper that it seems that this ordinance is aimed primarily at three people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9962)|
| 2:46:08| and I wanted to be here to say that it appears that I'm one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| but I wanted to remind everybody that it doesn't just apply to three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9973)|
| 2:46:19| As I spoke on this before, I outlined a number of professions and people to whom it applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9979)|
| 2:46:27| Surveyors, engineers, architects, business executives, members of joint ventures who do developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9987)|
| 2:46:36| representatives of LLCs and or partnerships, and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:42| and I am, by illustration, going to talk about even some more tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:50| I thought maybe rather than to say I'm opposed to this and go through a legal dissertation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10010)|
| 2:46:58| which I think you all have probably already seen enough of to suit you for one evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10018)|
| 2:47:03| I'd illustrate the issue by some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10023)|
| 2:47:10| I want to start by saying under this ordinance, registration is required when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10030)|
| 2:47:18| every person qualifying as a lobbyist under this chapter shall register by filing a form prescribed by the county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:26| within five days after becoming a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10046)|
| 2:47:31| Two, any person who registers as a lobbyist shall, at the time of registering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10051)|
| 2:47:38| furnish written proof of his authority to lobby on behalf of each employer to the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10058)|
| 2:47:47| So you have five days within which to register after becoming employed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10067)|
| 2:47:54| and you have to, at the time you register, furnish written proof of your authority to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10074)|
| 2:48:04| Example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| It's Thursday afternoon, about 3 o'clock, and a phone rings in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:12| and a gentleman who's a developer in Atlanta tells me he has a matter on county commission agenda Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10092)|
| 2:48:20| He thought he was going to be there, but he may not be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| Will I represent him? Because he now understands there's some opposition to his proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10103)|
| 2:48:30| I say, I'll put you on hold, I'll check my conflicts, I'll check my schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10110)|
| 2:48:34| and after a few minutes I go back on and say, I can represent you if you want me to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10114)|
| 2:48:39| I don't have a problem. I am going to be there, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| He says, fine, you're hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| I said, wait, you've got to send me a letter, because I have to register as a lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| and you have to send me a letter confirming that I have the authority to lobby for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:56| He says, I'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| We hang up. I'm now engaged as his lawyer to represent him Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10139)|
| 2:49:08| About 30 seconds after my phone call, he gets another one from somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| and his $30 million project in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is about to go down the tubes with all sorts of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:21| and he got to get down there fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| Secretary, get me a ticket first thing out of here in the morning on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:28| I've got to get home and pack my bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10168)|
| 2:49:31| Do you think getting that letter to me is uppermost in his mind? Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| Friday, he's flying out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| Friday, my letter doesn't come by e-mail or fax or whatever, and I'm worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10179)|
| 2:49:48| But maybe I do or don't call, or I may be in motion in court somewhere. Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| But Monday, I haven't got it, and I call, and, well, he left out of here, and he's somewhere in Puerto Rico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10192)|
| 2:50:01| Now, I'm supposed to be down here because I told him I was going to represent him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10201)|
| 2:50:08| and I'm supposed to be here to represent him because that's what lawyers are supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| But you see, I can't do that because I don't have the right to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10213)|
| 2:50:20| because I haven't got this form figured out or filed yet, and I don't know that I'm going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10220)|
| 2:50:29| Well, most people say, well, just go down there and postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10229)|
| 2:50:32| Read the definition of the actions that are covered by the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10232)|
| 2:50:39| I suggest to you you couldn't even ask for a postponement without being engaged in lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10239)|
| 2:50:48| Let's talk about another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| Where does this ordinance provide that you're, first of all, who, if anybody, is supposed to file what, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10254)|
| 2:51:03| if there's an asserted violation of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| There's no provision for filing of a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| It talks about if you file a false one, but it doesn't talk about who can file a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10271)|
| 2:51:17| Where? What's the nature of the complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| For violations of the ordinances, normally ordinances are enforced by the chief enforcement officer of the county, being the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10282)|
| 2:51:35| Is the sheriff going to go down to somewhere and file a civil warrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| Or is he going to do something in some other form to pursue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| Or is it somebody else that's supposed to pursue it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| And if, indeed, somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| You've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| I'm going to take more than one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| Take me longer than one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10319)|
| 2:52:00| Point of order and privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| It is not the order of our guests to tell us how we are to use our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10323)|
| 2:52:11| I'll hand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10332)|
| 2:52:13| I'll deal with it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| You've got one minute, and when we get to that point, we'll see what we do from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10337)|
| 2:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| Punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| And this ordinance specifically says, for a violation of it, you shall be punished by a civil penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10343)|
| 2:52:32| Is it penal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| Is it not penal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| Is it a civil action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| Or is it something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10357)|
| 2:52:41| Now I'm going to get one other example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10361)|
| 2:52:42| I've got about five or six, and I suggest that anybody before you seriously consider voting on this ordinance, you read it carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| But I want to give you one more example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10368)|
| 2:52:50| County Purchasing calls my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| They have a contract with the county to do service for the county of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| It's coming up for an extension in about six or eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| County Purchasing says, we'd like to talk to you about that contract, Mr. Garbage Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10382)|
| 2:53:11| because we think we want to change the level of service at one location for our county buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10391)|
| 2:53:16| and change the level of service at another location a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| We need to sit down and ask you some questions and see what this looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| while we decide whether we're going to extend the contract for another five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| or whether we want to go out for a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| My client calls me because if this is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| I'm going to be the guy that has to draw the amendment or the extension agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090323part2?start=10413)|
