| 0:00:11| Let me ask Ms. Pilo to open us with a word of prayer, and then I will ask Mr. Frost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=11)|
| 0:00:16| lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=16)|

| 0:00:26| Our Father, we're grateful for this another day, another day where we can serve you in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=26)|
| 0:00:33| so many of the varied ways in which your servants do provide service to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=33)|
| 0:00:43| We're so grateful for the willingness of people to commit to the responsibilities that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=43)|
| 0:00:47| theirs, and we're so grateful for those who just make it their responsibility to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=47)|
| 0:00:54| life better for their neighbors, for their friends, and for their fellow citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=54)|

| 0:01:06| to us for leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=66)|

| 0:01:15| come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| We pray that you'll be with us during this time together, and may the issues that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=76)|
| 0:01:24| decide be that best for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=84)|

| 0:02:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Let's go with items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Are there any items for withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Mr. Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| There's a light on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| I think that's nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Any motions for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Any items on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| I would like to ask Mr. Swanson if during the adoption of the agenda it is possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| to move to add items to the consent agenda and if it is, I would like to propose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| the resolutions 8A through 8H, which are all appointments, and the ordinances, the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=180)|
| 0:03:09| ordinances, which are 12G through 12N, be added to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| And if there are any of those particular items that any council member would like read aloud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| into the record, particularly as an honorarium, then those could be deleted from that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| In terms of public notice, may that be accomplished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Yes, that may be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| The council is entitled under Chapter 7.5 of the City Code to set its own agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| It can set a consent portion of the agenda, but it has to be done unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| So it has to be a non-controversial item that you unanimously agree should be on the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| So with respect to the items that you just named, if any council, probably the most efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| way to do this is any council member who wishes any of those items not to be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| on the consent agenda may simply note that, and I assume there would be a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| to your motion that would delete that because it does have to be unanimous for council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| add any item to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Then I would move that 8A through H and 12G through N be added to the consent agenda minus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=254)|
| 0:04:23| any that council members may wish to amend my motion to disinclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| All right, the motion is seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| I see two lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Are they on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Ms. Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| I just want to make an observation, and I will not oppose your motion, but I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=276)|
| 0:04:46| hesitate to support it just for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| This basically involves people who have been willing to serve on various boards and take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| various positions, and this is a public meeting, and I think it's very important sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| for those persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| I think it shows an appreciation, for one thing, for their willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| And for number two, I think very often for people who have a particular interest in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| board or some group that it's very helpful to know who the appointed members of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| board are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| So, for that reason, I would not want to oppose your motion, but I think it fails to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=322)|
| 0:05:31| those people who I think it's very important to acknowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| That's just the comment that I appreciate being able to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| If I may respond to that, a way to deal with that issue, and it's a legitimate issue, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| a way to deal with that issue would simply be to ask the city recorder to read the caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| of each of the items that is now being added to the consent agenda, and that would then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| put on the record those things that you just mentioned and have those persons' service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| acknowledged through that method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| And that way, you only have one vote rather than, say, however many that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| That's not my thought, but I don't want to serve as the law director, so I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| You can do it as you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| You can do it without doing that, or you can do it doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| And this is really council's agenda, and it's up to you all to decide how you want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| I just throw that out as a possible method to deal with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Well, and I'd further comment, and then I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| You know, sometimes we kind of like to acknowledge those persons who have come down to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| that appointment, and this kind of, if we make this a regular procedure, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| give the opportunity for those persons to be recognized here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Mr. Holquist, and then Ms. Roddy, Mr. Bailey, and then myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| I have mixed feelings about putting this on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| I'm not necessarily opposed to it either, but if we develop a culture where we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| put them all on consent, and the implication is we should never question anything or anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| as far as an appointment goes, and there's that much more unease at addressing an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| appointment or individual item because we never do that, because we always put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| I would be very uncomfortable if we ended up in that place, and it might take longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| than I'm on council for us to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| But that is a concern that I have, and I have a question on one of these about who the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| is replacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| So I have a question about that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| I'm not saying I'm opposed to putting them on consent, but I want to talk about it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Oh, I was just going to say that with the permission of my second, I could divide my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| motion into two, and that is to put A through H on consent, and then separately to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| 12G through N on consent, which are kind of two separate groups of motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| I don't know who my second was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| I like that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| So with the permission of Mr. Booker, I'll make a substitute motion of two motions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| split that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| So consent for A through H would be one vote, and consent for 12G through N would be another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| and then we can deal with them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| And is that a legitimate motion, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Is that a legitimate motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| It is legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| I thought it would be, but Mr. Bailey, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Other than the fact that I concur with some of my colleagues' comments, Councilman Hullquist's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| on going through some of these appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| I appreciate Councilman Roddy's intent here, but I even try to encourage appointments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| I have to come up here to be acknowledged because this is a sacrifice, and I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| needs to be read into the record, but I'm indifferent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| I'm next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I think it's an interesting discussion we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| It clearly suggests that people are interested in doing more at the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I'm always real worried on sort of how we think these things out, and I'm especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| worried sort of, one, Mr. Hullquist raising this issue of we get into a habit of you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| question those, and it gets really funny if you do, and it becomes a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| I also think sort of doing things at the spur of the moment is kind of a challenge, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| inclined right now to say I'm going to vote no on your motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| So just, it doesn't hurt, but, so, Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| I was going to add to Mr. Hullquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| I didn't think about a sense of unease of pulling somebody off because they were being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| I guess my thought was if you developed a habit of putting those appointments on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| any Councilmember could pull anyone off to honor them because I, as well, like to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| appointees to attend, but if they're not here, then it could just be read in the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| or the caption read as Mr. Swanson suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Let me, I'm going to go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Mr. Hullquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Well, I was on before yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| One of the things that I'd like to do is to get a policy that's clear on this, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| one of the things that becomes interesting with a consent calendar is it is a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| that everybody sees beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| If this is something we know when the agenda comes out on Thursday, something's on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| it becomes much easier for any Councilperson to say anonymously I'd like to pull this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| It doesn't become a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| So I prefer to have a policy that says we're always doing these, we all know it, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| can deal with it much, much subtler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| So Mr. Hullquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Well, I'm going to make it a little more uncomfortable for everybody probably by saying this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| there could come a time when someone would actually object to an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| I know that that's not our culture and that's not the way we operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| And under the current, with the current setup with this Council and this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| it has never been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| But that doesn't mean in the future that it wouldn't be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| So I think our approach now is to generally just approve whoever's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| And that's fine because they're good appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Typically they've always been good appointments since I've been on Council with this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| I won't go back into that earlier history, but I'm not so sure that's always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| I want this Council to be prepared to say no to an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| And I know maybe the people don't want to talk about that, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| I mean, I don't necessarily want to drag it out into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| I just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=691)|
| 0:11:31| There are two different motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| First motion is on 8A through H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| All those in favor of adding 8A through H to the consent agenda by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=705)|
| 0:11:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Second motion was 12G through N to the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Both of these needing to be unanimous, both motions fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Yes, Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| 6A is an application for renewal of a certificate of compliance for Stephen C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| Swofford, DBA K&K Wines and Spirits, 5746 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Is there discussion, Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Is that a light on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| I'm going to go back on that last ruling of the second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I don't think it failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| I'd like to hear a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| It had to be unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| It had to be unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=749)|
| 0:12:29| So it won against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Any discussion on 6A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| If not, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=757)|
| 0:12:37| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| 6B is an application for renewal of a certificate of compliance for John Curry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Enterprises, LLC, DBA Westtown Wine and Spirits, 7319 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Was that a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| I have one quick thing as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| The city, I'm actually having not even looked at this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Mr. Lyons, could you do the mayor's report for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Do you have a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Because I have not even looked at this one yet and it's too long to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| I would be glad to fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| The city of Knoxville was awarded at the Tennessee Municipal League Award for Excellence in Green Leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| And that was one thing we wanted to announce this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| And that's for a variety of activities that the council has been very supportive in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| And we wanted to, again, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Everything from the application for the Solar America Cities Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| to the Energy and Sustainability Task Force, which Councilman Woodhull serves on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| and to the support for the Amoresco Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| So all of that got us some good recognition to Chattanooga, in fact, this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=832)|
| 0:13:52| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| We deserve a pat on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| I wanted to make a brief report, perhaps in conjunction with Councilman Holdquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| He and I have both been working with a task force or a committee, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| that was called together by the chairman of MPC, Mr. Trey Benefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| regarding sustainable development incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| And this goes hand in glove with the award that Mr. Lyons just announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and the direction that the city has taken in terms of leadership with sustainability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| And a draft of this discussion is going to go on the MPC website as of Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| It is just a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| And at this point, Mr. Benefield and others, I guess, are going to be taking this out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| and actively seeking input toward this draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| The idea is to encourage developers to consider practices that meet sustainable development goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| and then offer incentives for meeting those development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| So I think it's an exciting program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| It looks at asking developers to consider connectivity, walkability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=906)|
| 0:15:15| pedestrian and bicycle mobility, visitability, access to public spaces, energy efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=915)|
| 0:15:25| consideration of riparian areas and floodplains, wetlands, consideration of greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| So a lot of things that some of our leaders in the development community are doing already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| but we'd like to have, MPC would like to have a way to encourage that more actively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| So I encourage you to engage in that process and let any of us know on the committee if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| And I'll defer to Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| I appreciate Councilman Roddy bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| There were some concerns about whether or not it was adequately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| the public was adequately notified about that and hopefully we're working our way through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| I think the process and the committee or task force that was set up, I think that the intent is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| and I think there has been real progress, as Councilman Roddy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| I would like to see us move more strongly in that direction, the very public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| And I would hope that at some point we can really begin to address comprehensive planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| in a much more, quote, comprehensive way than we have in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| We saw it in Charlotte, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| And get away from the sort of piecemeal sector plan approach and really begin to plan comprehensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=993)|
| 0:16:41| transportation as well as land use, all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| So I'm hoping we're moving in that direction one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Mr. Holquist, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Oh, yes, Mr. Holquist, Mrs. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Is there a public, or what's the public comment period on this draft proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| I don't believe that a deadline or parameters for public comment have been initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| The draft was finally to, I think, to a point where the committee felt like there was a good enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| starting place for folks to comment that, like I said, will go online on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Mr. Benefield is making a first public presentation to the Green Building Council, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| although don't quote me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| I think he said the Green Building Council on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| So that's the deadline for getting that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| He also has been approached by some, I believe, some neighborhood groups who'd like to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| more about that and has agreed to make presentations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| When I spoke with him today, there were not plans at this point for an open forum, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| I'm sure that will follow at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| It's kind of a balancing act to put forth a product that you feel like is worthy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| comment, that's not so rough, that it's not even a good starting place, and yet also not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| getting all the way to the finish line with it so that folks have a chance to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| So hopefully, the committee is a diverse body and has worked very hard to get to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| where the draft is not so rough around the edges that it's unworkable, but is still certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| A question for Mr. Holquist, since he brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Has there been public notice of these different meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Well, I'm not the best one to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Mr. Donaldson is here, he may want to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| My understanding is that that has happened to some degree, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| I was under the impression early on that there was some lack of clarity in my own mind in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| terms of what happened, but Mr. Donaldson may be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Mr. Holquist and counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| All of the meetings of the working group have been publicly noticed by publishing in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| We are just to the point now to start a very public process, having a product in good enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| shape to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Tomorrow you should receive paper copies of the draft program, and we will email them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| We have scheduled space and time in the small assembly room for a briefing of city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1145)|
| 0:19:16| county commission, and the planning commission for July 13th, that's a Monday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| And we have reserved space later in the month of July for a public meeting, and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1162)|
| 0:19:29| be scheduling additional public opportunities as well with various interest groups as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| What members of the county commission were on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Two members of the county commission, Tony Norman and Finbar Saunders served on the working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Yes, Mrs. Mitchell, you're great on sending out public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| I don't recall getting a public notice from you on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Earlier reports of council members, I've got four quick things, but I'll just go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| One interesting one, I actually had down to raise a question about how we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| We had an interesting discussion earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I don't know if anybody has any desire to try and move forward to regularly do consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| I don't know if we do want to talk about it at some point at a dinner to see if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| a way we get a regular policy on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I'm just going to toss that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| The other interesting thing that I actually want to suggest folks think about us getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| together and talk about is the current state of the tenure plan and chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| MPC, as you all know, last week took a significant step in some direction on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| I know that will be coming to council at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| I frankly would actually love a chance to talk with folks about that issue before we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| faced with something as concrete as that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| I'm not at the next two dinners, so there's not an opportunity to do a discussion there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| that would be sunshined and open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| I did want to suggest if other people were interested, we could talk about what needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| to be done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Is this on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Mr. Holquist, why don't you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I think that will probably come to us on appeal on July 14th at Flinnegan School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Just so you'll know the timing of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| If I may suggest, I will be on my honeymoon that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| If we could postpone that to the next meeting, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Where's your priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| I want to announce, as this is your chair of the audit committee who's willing to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| anybody else do that soon, there's an audit committee meeting next Thursday, June 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| at 4 o'clock at the city-county conference room, room 460 of the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1303)|
| 0:21:52| Audit committee members, of course, have this on their calendar from the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| year, and they're, I'm sure, excited about this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Finally, I want to just take an opportunity- You did say the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| You did say 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I did say 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| As the vice mayor, I want to actually take a second to wish our law director a happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| In honor of your birthday, we won't sing to you, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| Any other reports of counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| No, but you may want to wish me a very late happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Absolutely, Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Since in honor of your birthday, I won't sing to you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| I won't ever be guilty of singing to you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| That's a good gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| But it was May 31st, and I just thought I would mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Because birthdays are going to be very precious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| I believe we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1369)|

| 0:23:09| well on that board, and I am happy to vote for his reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1389)|

| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Ms. Coughlin, my understanding is there are some inconsistencies in our code regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| a safety director and that your office was already aware of that and was working to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| those inconsistencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Could you address that and what's happening with that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| There had been a position of an officer of public safety that had been there in quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| And in 2004, an ordinance was passed to clarify that those duties fell within either the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| of police or the fire chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| But we are actually doing an entire code update and we are looking at those and we'll do all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| the clarifications to remove all the references to public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| Is it your opinion that it would be preferable to consider this ordinance after those housekeeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1742)|
| 0:29:12| measures are enacted so that we're all clear on what the requirements of the code are relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| to this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| Right now, I think it's okay to pass it because with the ordinance we have in place, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| it's under traffic, those responsibilities under the language of the ordinance would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| fall under the responsibilities of the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So it's okay as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| But we will be going through to clarify all the public safety positions so you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| having to look at the specific duty and decide whether it falls under the chief of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| or the fire chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| And when do you anticipate that will come to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| We're working on that now and it's going to be a several-month process, so probably in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| I guess I have some further questions for Chief Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| The last time I asked Chief Price some questions about how our traffic school currently works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| and I understand from Chief Price that the annual expenditures for the traffic school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| are a little more than $45,000 and that fees charged vary from year to year depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1816)|
| 0:30:24| attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| But generally, the revenue realized by the city is between $55,000 and $65,000 roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1825)|
| 0:30:35| somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| And these classes are taught by off-duty officers who are working in an overtime capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| And this attendance at traffic school is mandated by Judge Rawson as part of his process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| hearing traffic citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Well, that's an option to the offender to take the traffic school and to aid the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| in making an ultimate decision on the adjudication of the charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Do you have any concerns about this ordinance that you would like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| I just want to clarify that there's nothing wrong with the way it's being done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I don't believe this particular ordinance hasn't been advanced because of a flaw in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| the existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| At the same time, I have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| First, for either Mr. Swanson or Mrs. Copeland, in the proposed ordinance, Section E, it talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| about city court clerks shall provide a list of approved entities in Knox County to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| person ordered, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Should it or could it say approved entities within the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Well, it could, but I tracked the language within the state code when I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| My preference is that if you're going to adopt something like this, it tracks the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| of the TCA as much as possible, and that's why I did it that way, because certainly there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| may be entities in Knox County that a person could go to to attend this type of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1936)|
| 0:32:26| school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Really, when you get down to it, what you're doing is you're creating an agency that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| going to compete with the city of Knoxville for the revenue associated with this fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| It's just a question of policy for you all, whether you want to create the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| of that additional agency or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| If you want to do that, there is a state code provision that this tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| The only thing that this does that doesn't really track the state code is subsection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| B that provides for a driver education course with different levels of curricula, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| Judge Rawson, if he chose to do it, could send you to course A, B, or C, depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| what your level of traffic offense has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| Judge Rawson expressed an interest in doing that, and it's not inconsistent with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Because Judge Rawson had expressed some interest in that, I added that to the state law provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| Everything else that's in here tracks the state law, and it essentially provides an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| opportunity for a private entity to compete with the city in providing this traffic education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| school or driver education school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Chief, the financial considerations involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Could we possibly get to the point where the police department, we're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| having to supplement the police department if there's a loss of revenue over this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2033)|
| 0:34:02| It's not like it's making money, but it's more than breaking even, and a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| in government, as you know, we don't break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| What exactly is your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Are we going to get to the point where, is it possible to get to the point where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| is going to be a city service, another city service is going to have to be subsidized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| because it could be losing money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Well, I can't predict that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| That's why I started with the way I did, and that is nothing against what has been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| here tonight, but the process as it currently stands works fine for us, and I believe for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| Judge Ross in the Municipal Court, as to whether or not, if there were competitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| out there attempting to get this same business, I don't think it would ever get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| where the traffic school would be a negative for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| I think it would break even pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| I have no doubt that I'm sure Mr. Wisner has a good plan involved, but I haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2107)|
| 0:35:15| one complaint, not one iota, about any issues with this, and I think it's a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| for people who need additional driving instruction to be taught by police officers in an accredited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2122)|
| 0:35:32| law enforcement agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| I see that as a good thing, and I mean, personally, you know, I intend to, I always try to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| the police department, so I just, I'm sorry I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Mr. Wisner, you currently have a certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Yes, sir, with the National Safety Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| And who works for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Who do you typically hire to teach these courses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| Retired police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| And you know, when Mr. Councilman Frost, when you mentioned that, you know, you hadn't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| any complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| I mean, what would you complain about, or who would you complain to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| There's, you know, there's no competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| I get complaints about parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| I mean, but there's no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| There's no reason to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Oh, I've gotten, no, I get complaints about, you know, for example, KUB being in competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| with private, you know, refrigerator repair places, and you know, what I'm saying, I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| gotten any complaints from a citizen calling to say, I went through the police department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| driver remedial classes, and they stink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I haven't gotten anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| I wouldn't think anybody would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| They do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| But have you heard any complaints from Mr. Wisner's course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| Let me ask you this, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| When you talk about the state code, what do you think the intent is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Is it to have numerous options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| What's the norm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| If you're asking me what I think the intent of the state code is, I think the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| the state code is to provide the possibility for these traffic schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| And I think, as I read the legislation, it's really up to the people in the local areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| involved to decide whether they want to do it in this way or whether they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| it, I mean, if they're going to do it pursuant to the statute, they have to do it the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| the statute says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| But they don't necessarily have to do it pursuant to that statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| They can do it their own way instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| So this basically would allow Judge Rawson to choose a school, to designate a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| to send an offender to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| I think the offender gets to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Okay, so he would say go to traffic school, and then they have the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| How would one know what the options are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| How would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| That's why subsection E says the city court clerk shall provide a list of approved entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| I gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Well, I don't see any reason to provide an option to have competition, and it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2287)|
| 0:38:16| a good thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Chief Allen, I don't know whether or not you can answer this, but the net revenue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| the city is currently realizing on traffic school, does that stay within the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| And if so, what sort of activities might it support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| It does not go to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| It goes through the municipal court into the city's general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| So through the general fund, it supports all the activities that the city takes part in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| from capital projects for sidewalks and parks and recreation to salaries for police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| and firefighters and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| It would go just to the general fund that would have open access to every project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| the city is involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| I would be disinclined to support this ordinance for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Mr. Weiser has brought this to my attention, and I assume he has to you, my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| for a while, quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| And one of the things that he proposed to me was, me being the chairman of the Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| Traffic Calming Committee, that he might possibly take a portion of his fees and feed that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2367)|
| 0:39:36| into the city's Neighborhood Traffic Calming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| And so, especially when it comes to some of the speeding in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| So you would basically have the violators paying for funding our Neighborhood Traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| Calming Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| And I was wondering, Mr. Weiser, if that would still be something you might come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| us with and maybe propose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| I made Knox County $100,000 last year, and they didn't spend out one dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| All the expense incurred upon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| And I don't know that, you know, we could even do that, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| You know, if the, I say I don't even know if we can do that, because the city would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| provide a list of different entities, approved entities, and I don't know if you cut a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2422)|
| 0:40:31| with the city or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| If there's a way that we could go back and maybe devise some type of a policy where any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| approved entity might participate in, you know, a limitation of fees or a way where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2440)|
| 0:40:48| that might level the playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| They can do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| It's a question of whether they want to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| It's not required that they do that under the ordinance that you're looking at right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| It would not be required that they contribute to any particular program of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Nothing would stop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| The same thing, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Could the city, with what's presently in place, not including this ordinance, designate all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| monies from KPD received from this to go into the traffic calming program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2481)|
| 0:41:29| I think you could probably adopt an ordinance that would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| If I may, again, just for clarification, the money does not go to the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| The money goes to the municipal court and then into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| So just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| I was going to say that I've discussed this, as we have, I've discussed it in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| hearings with the mayor present on some sort of a percentage going to traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2511)|
| 0:42:03| And, you know, I guess that's sort of micromanaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| So that was kind of, I guess we decided that wasn't a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| If we are, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2549)|

| 0:42:37| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Councilman Gabbard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Councilman Gabbard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Councilman Gabbard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| By a vote of 63, the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| 10A is an appeal by Easterday Estates LLC of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| decision to deny a one-year plan amendment from low-density residential to medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| residential for property located on the west side of Sisk Road, south of Pleasant Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| Road, in conjunction with 12D, which is an ordinance approving the request of Easterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| Estates LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| No one has signed up to speak, but I see Mr. Drennigan at the podium, and I see Mr. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| back there, so I'm assuming that, and some other folks back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| Let me explain the rules real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Both sides, by council rules, both sides can have up to three people speaking for up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| The side that is the proposer in this case, which would be Mr. Drennigan, before a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| is made, gets to go first, then people get to respond, and then the original speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2629)|
| 0:43:58| gets a two-minute rebuttal piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| Questions from council members does not count against your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| The timing is not perfect, because we time from the clock that is behind the speaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| head, but the chair of the meeting will inform people when they have about a minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| And Mr. Drennigan very wisely took time handing things out while I explained that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| Mr. Drennigan, if you would come to the microphone and give your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| It is 745.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Victor Drennigan, 108 Stikoy Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| And if I would prefer to defer to let the people from the neighborhood speak, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| That's not how our rules work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| If somebody wants to make a motion to amend the rules that is permissible, we usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| have one side speak, then the other, and by our rules, you go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| So please start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| The issue in front of the city council tonight is dealing directly with the issue of sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2709)|
| 0:45:18| development and how infill and smart growth can be accomplished inside the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| The Easter Day property is nine and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| It is about 800 feet, approximately, from improvements that are being done to the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| of Sisk Road and Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| And at MPC, when the sector plan was reviewed, because the property did not face directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2742)|
| 0:45:49| onto Pleasant Ridge Road, the MPC staff did not view as a significant change to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2749)|
| 0:45:59| and therefore denied the sector plan amendment to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| And what I am putting forward is the holistic view that the millions of dollars that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| city is spending to improve Pleasant Ridge Road, to add an eight-foot greenway, to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| a five-foot sidewalk that previously have never existed, to connect all of West Haven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| to the, or certainly make it possible for all of West Haven to safely get to Victor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Ashe Park and to be able to rely less on cars and more on walking and bikes if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| choose to, are the very reasons that this property should be rezoned to a medium-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2792)|

| 0:46:38| I am asking for 11 units an acre on this property, which will basically double the density from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| the 46 units that are currently designed on the property to approximately 100 condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| I have provided pictures of what the front elevation of the properties will look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| and the second page of the color rendering shows how the parking is actually functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| on these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| The particular building in front of you is a four-plex building designed with upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| units and downstairs units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| The one-bedrooms are on the ground floor and there is two-bedroom and three-bedroom mixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| in this particular unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| It was the face of the building, you look and it looks like it's a large house, a la| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| the concept big house, and the other garages for the other units enter from the side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| We are able to double the density on the property, create an entire new mix of housing which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| isn't available in this market area at all at any price, and create the situation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| we are only increasing the impervious area to the entire site less than 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| It is the definition of what neighborhood design should be if sustainable development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| accessible, universal design for housing is to be implemented in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| The issues that the neighborhood has brought up, and I really do first, I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| forget to thank Maggie Hughes and several of the members of the neighborhood who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| opposing the project for the very courteous way that they've raised questions and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| which give us an opportunity to have a really serious discussion on how development should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| occur in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| The issue of traffic congestion, the property is directly opposite West Haven School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2906)|
| 0:48:36| There is a queue of traffic in the mornings and in the afternoon for people letting their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| kids off and picking their children up, and the concern is that this neighborhood will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| create more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| The primary design of the neighborhood is to allow, of the 100 units, approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| 25 to 30 will be one bedroom condominiums, and we do believe that these will be geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| to people who have time flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| They can come and go under their own schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| The number of three bedroom units that will be in the development will be actually a fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| number than were designed in the 46 unit concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| This substantially lowers the opportunity for teenage drivers in the neighborhood, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| most importantly, the improvements to Sisk Road will allow a continuous flow of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| onto Pleasant Ridge Road which has never been possible before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| If it wasn't for these improvements to the intersection with Sisk Road, I wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| here asking for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| The issue of school overcrowding is another concern that has been expressed to me by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| neighborhood, and there will certainly be people who live in this neighborhood who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| children who will go to West Haven or to go to Northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| The reality is that the design, again, of the neighborhood is not geared to attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| school-age children, even though there will be some living there, but the most perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| place for children to live is next to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| It truly is a neighborhood school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| The sidewalks and the greenways that are being built along Pleasant Ridge Road will encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| more children to be able to walk to school and walk with their parents rather than queuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| up in the cars and driving 3,000 or 4,000 feet as they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| The ability to cross Pleasant Ridge Road safely, which doesn't exist, will exist with the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| road design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| All of these features will improve walking to the school, riding bikes to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| parents escorting their children to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| It reduces traffic that is now in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| The issue of the design of the houses, the way in which the universal design concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| is going to be employed into the development of the houses are the very essence of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| I hear time and time and time again from the city council and from the planning authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| I am asking the city council to approve the sector plan amendment and allow me to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| a medium density residential zoning on this property for 11 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| I have two quick questions, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| You mentioned improvements that you're making to Sisk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I'm not making any improvements to Sisk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I meant Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| The other thing, I want to ask real quickly about parking at the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| We've got the top thing that shows some garages and then the bottom one that has some parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| The required parking you need for this, is it all met by the garage parking and the stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| on the side is extra or is it all required to get your required parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| We haven't finalized the design of the units yet as to how the total parking will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| We do expect approximately 90% of all the units to have garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| Right now we are looking at a design that would have approximately 5 to 10% of the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| that didn't have garages, but we do anticipate to be well within all the parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| of city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Any other questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Is there anybody else who wishes to speak in favor of this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Are there folks who are opposed to this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Now, by rule we're allowed to have three speakers of up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| Council may amend those rules in ways that allow more people to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| I saw about six hands up there, so before anybody speaks, what would council's preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| on how we hear from the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Do all of them want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Do all of them want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Did I ask the question wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Do all of them want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Are there folks who want to speak in opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I asked that question wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| There are three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Well, then we're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| It is 753...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And I have to warn you, the clock on the side of the wall doesn't have the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| We do that just to confuse people, but the clock I'm looking at says 753, and you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| My name is Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| I live at 3520 Peachwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you, Vice Mayor Becker, councilmen, councilwomen, staff, appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| Looks like you have a little more fun than we do sometimes at our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| I was asked by the neighbors that are just adjacent, the West Haven community primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3206)|
| 0:53:33| and then there's a newer neighborhood on the other side of Mr. Jernigan's development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| speak to this, and possibly because I'm just an old-time resident of West Haven, my small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| family farm was right next to the Easter Day farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| And so, as a boy, I can remember going over to the Easter Day farm, and it was the typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| sort of gentlemanly agricultural operation, a few cows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| Mr. Easter Day had some show chickens, little small silver chickens, and had a small pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| It was really a neat place to be able to use as a kid and growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| Then I moved back, and so I really enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| When it became time for the Easter Days to sell the farm, I was somewhat involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| that process and spoke to the Easter Days some, and certainly and actually spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| Mr. Jernigan some about the process and had some ideas about how to use it and how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| make it possibly a little bit different type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| I greatly respect Mr. Jernigan and his abilities as a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| There's several items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| The main items that I want to emphasize are just the items from our MPC that were in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| to increasing the density, and so that's what I'm here to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| I think it is best to keep the density at the original level or the level of up to 5.99| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3305)|
| 0:55:15| at the most if that has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| I agree with Mr. Jernigan on many principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| In fact, we work together on a task force for hillside protection, and we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| these issues and how they're really good for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| The ideas of smart growth and increasing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| If you increase density and it's well done and it's well designed, it can be very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| for our community, and we agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| The big issue here, though, is when we talk about density in our area, it is a fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| within a mile and a half radius of this site, there are literally thousands of apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| There are apartment complexes along Pleasant Ridge Road, along Merchant's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| These bear the names of Tillery Ridge, Foxfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| The new one that's about a mile and a half up Pleasant Ridge that's just at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| line legacy point, there's just a tremendous amount of density in our area, so much so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| that I think that probably by the time Pleasant Ridge Road improvements are finished, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| going to probably be somewhat taxed, and so that's a consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| The major points from MPC, and I'm just going to recite those to you, and then I'll sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| How much time do I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| The requested densities up to 5.99 as were approved by MPC are consistent with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| The major conflicts with traffic considerations, if higher densities are approved on Sisk Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| These have nothing to do with the improvements on Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Utilities for sewer and water are designed for existing densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| The MPC staff recommended a denial to the one-year plan amendment, and that 5.99 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| consistent with current plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| Based on our observations and MPC staff recommendations and MPC's vote of 13-0 on April 9th of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3440)|
| 0:57:29| year, we hope that you will choose to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Mr. Norman, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Did you ever support this appeal in whole for the density and everything requested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Did you ever support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| If I recall correctly, a conversation I had with Mr. Jernigan this afternoon, he indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| to me that you were going to be here speaking in favor of his appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| Have you supported his appeal, then changed your mind at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| A question for Mr. Norman as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| I understood you referencing apartment complexes that were in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| You do realize that this is a condominium development and not an apartment complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| The principle of density is that our area experiences a fairly dense set of dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| and therefore, I think that the argument that increasing density doesn't really apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| that particular, our part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Commissioner Norman, going back to Councilman Roddy's question, I think you understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| under city code, it's essentially the same as what you deal with in the county zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| The nomenclature is slightly different, but the rules are very similar, that when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| to multifamily, there is no way to zone for condominiums, that what is today supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3544)|
| 0:59:12| to be condominiums can tomorrow be apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| You're aware of that, are you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| That's another consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| If things didn't go well for Mr. Jernigan and he was to lose this property for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| reason, then the increased density would allow whoever the next person was to maybe do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| things that were not nearly as desirable as what Mr. Jernigan's got planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| That's another consideration for raising the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| I believe our next speaker is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| It is 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| My name is Maggie Hughes, 4637 Baberton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3600)|
| 1:00:07| First of all, on the issue you were just discussing, Mr. Jernigan has stated to me directly, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| will likely, though he is presenting condos, will likely have to rent these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3615)|
| 1:00:21| as he begins this project simply to get the funding to continue this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| That is a huge concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| Once you get in here and start renting these projects, how are you then going to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| transfer over to make them sellable once it starts to be a rental community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3635)|
| 1:00:44| All of you got an email from him last night at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| I don't know if you were awake at midnight to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| I didn't get it until late this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| So I'm a little late on keeping up with that information from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| A couple of things there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| He keeps referring to the sidewalks that will be able to allow this group to access Victor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| Ash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| We've had access from Sisqo to Victor Ash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| It may not be as nice and luxurious as the greenways and the five-foot sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| The only new will be from Sisqo down to 640 towards Rambling Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| So that sidewalk will not be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| A couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I don't know how many of you have been able to see his article from the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| I've just had a chance to briefly glance at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| It's on sprawling of populations in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| I haven't been able to see too much of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| I note there's, I wish I'd seen the whole article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| I see page one of seven and page five of seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| I don't know what the entire article would have presented to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| I understand the part he has shared with us here, though, is, you know, we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3723)|
| 1:02:12| to spread our area too thin, so why don't we smoosh us in together is the general idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| Well, our four plexus and our duplexes and six plexus and everything he is presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| in this area would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| But as Mr. Norman has presented, our area is pretty well smooshed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| We have lots and lots and lots of that in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| This does back up right up to my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| A lot of what he has had, I believe he said 25 to 30% of this community, he does plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| to be one bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| He hopes to see, as he says, some people who would have flexible timing of coming and going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| from this community, specifically referring to some folks possibly retired age who wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| have job-wise to be coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| I hope they'll forgive me, but the majority of the folks that are here opposing this are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| of that age that are just fine to stay in the homes that they are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| And it is not just six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| There's probably double that, 12 folks here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| They didn't want to raise their hand because they were afraid they were going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| say something if they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| So, and you notice he is the only one here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| I did email council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| I don't know if any of you had a question for me regarding anything from that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| I'd be happy as well to answer any of those questions, but I also spoke at the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| I have been opposed to this from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| I would also, Mr. Durning has been very wonderful with me, very open and honest, quick to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| whenever I've had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| So, thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| And one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Again, give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| It is 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Mr. Vice Mayor, members of council, thank you very much for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| My name is Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| I'm here tonight representing Norwood Homeowners Association by vote of our in discussion with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| our board of directors to be opposed to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| The end of our homeowners area is on the other side of Pleasant Ridge Road from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| Many of our children in the Norwood area are zoned to West Haven School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| What happens with this project has an effect on the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| First of all, let's get down to basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| We're not here to talk about pretty pictures or fourplexes or twoplexes or anything silly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| We're not here to talk about school overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| We're not here to talk about road hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| What we're here for, this is not a final concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| What we're here for is to change the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| Once that density is changed, then no one has any control except to go through another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| process with another development plan and who knows what that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Our homeowners association, when this condominium project was first proposed, we stayed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| from it because we thought that a condominium project of that density would be a good stabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| factor for the West Haven community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| To flip it up to apartment range with no plans, we don't know who the new developer may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| We don't know what the new plans will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| The only thing that we will be left with after this evening is a high density or a medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| density parcel in the middle of a suburban community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| We talk a lot about preserving housing and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| The way we kill housing is that sometimes at MPC, sometimes at Commission, we kill it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| one neighborhood at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| West Haven is an incredibly stable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| They've got a lot of new people circulating, recycling into houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| They have a lot of original residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Why would we want to do something with even the remotest possibility to destabilize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| I'm going to ask you from our side of Pleasant Ridge Road, please follow what MPC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| The staff recommended don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| MPC, at their most pro-development, voted 13 to nothing to turn this appeal down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| We ask City Council to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| There is not currently a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Mr. Jernigan, you get a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4003)|
| 1:06:52| The difficulty of creating sustainable development is being well articulated by each side right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| here, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| On a couple of notes, first, Mr. Frost, I want to be the first to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| I believe when I spoke with you, I said that Tony Norman would be speaking for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| and somehow that for the neighborhood in opposition, not for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| He's clearly speaking for his neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| The situation with the Easterday property, first, the Easterday family chose me to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| There were approximately 12 buyers for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| I had something like the fifth lowest offer among the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| The Easterday family chose me to develop the property because of the plan that is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| on the ground in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Those of you who have had a chance to see how the neighborhood is done, it's not a straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| line road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| We've really gone in and created a little park area in the center and we've worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| hard to create those elements that are in the neighborhood now that are the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| that people want and talk about, pervious concrete in the parking areas at the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| point in the property, curved streets, no direct line of sight, backyards for the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| condominiums and a flow of style for the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| The issue on density, I would like to point a couple of things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| The neighborhood around this property, the two-mile radius, approximately 37 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| of all the homeowners in that area, I'm sorry, 37 percent of the population in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| are renters, 63 percent are homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| If you take a two-mile circle around North Shore Drive at Morrell Road, 37 percent are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| renters, 63 percent are homeowners, exactly the same density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| The Sierra article that she referenced that I've sent people, I don't know how many developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| have ever sent out articles from the Sierra Club saying that the Sierra Club supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| the project and I've also sent one out from the EPA dealing with stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| Both of those articles deal with how to control sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| The EPA article, the pages that are missing, deal with giving grants to create development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| in other areas, which we don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| The issue, and Mr. Redman has brought up a really excellent point, and this I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| appreciate him doing, is that you all will see the concept plan as it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| No development can be approved on this property without another concept plan being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| for the property and it must be approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| There's a development at the intersection of Westmoreland and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| Unless there's a motion from Council, I'm going to ask you to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Let's give him a couple of minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| I'll finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Without objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| I'll finish very quickly on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| There's a neighborhood at the intersection of Sherwood Drive and Westland, about a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| feet off of Sherwood, a thousand feet off of North Shore, excuse me, that started out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| as a six lot subdivision, became a four lot subdivision, and it became a four lot subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| because City Council spent two years approving the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| The rationale here is that I'm positive everyone is paying attention to what's going on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| no concept plan could move forward if it didn't meet the criteria that we're laying out this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| I have a question for Mr. Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| What were those percentages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| You gave some percentages of homeowners versus residents in this particular area versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| same percentage of homeowners and residents around Paper Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| North Shore and Morrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| And that was the same number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| Approximately the same number in a two mile ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| I did this, I apologize for not having the exact number, but I'm pretty sure the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| at Sisk Road, the two mile circle is approximately 37% are renters, and I do know that the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| mile ring at North Shore and Morrell Road is 37%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| But that's the percentage of use of a residence, whether it's a renter or a homeowner, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| not the percentage, it's not the same thing as density, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| There's approximately 20,000, I'm sorry, there's approximately 12,000 people in the two mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| ring at Sisk Road, and there's approximately 20,000 people in the North Shore Drive-Morrell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| And what's that based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| That's a demographic study, and I'd be happy to get a copy of it and send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| I mean, I've got, I apologize, I ran it off the computer, I do them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| Okay, we finished hearing from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| There is not currently a motion on this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| I just want to say something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| We talked, there was a discussion of road improvements, and I noted in the minutes Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Brousseau, who's an MPC staffer, not an MPC commissioner, talked about there's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| for traffic and access, and there are not any plans for improvement to Sisk Road, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| there's a conflict with the traffic from the school West Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| There is not a motion at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| This question is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| Mr. Donaldson, in listening to Mr. Jernigan and then members of the neighborhood commenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| tonight, there seems to be a little bit of confusion in terms of how this has been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4348)|
| 1:12:34| to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Tonight, all we are considering is a change in the base zoning of the property, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4356)|
| 1:12:44| concept plan, which Mr. Jernigan has given us photographs of, would then have to go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| I'm just clarifying, would then have to go through an approval process as a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| through MPC, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Within the RP1 zone district, if it's currently zoned RP1 at up to five units to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| on the agenda tonight is a recommendation to increase that to 5.99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| Within the RP1 zone district, the development plan is what it's referred to as approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| by the planning commission, and it has to be approved prior to any building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| being issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| That can be appealed by any agreed party to city council, but without an appeal, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| approval lies with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| I heard Mr. Jernigan reference that that plan always came to us, and I did not recall that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| we signed off on every concept plan for a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| I guess my comment would be that I think there are some essential positives in the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4422)|
| 1:13:54| Mr. Jernigan is presenting in terms of sustainable growth, looking at infill within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4434)|
| 1:14:03| the opportunity to add new housing stock within the city is limited because so much is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| built out, and the idea of a condominium development where there is owner-occupied housing, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| and not rental is certainly appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| However, I guess I concur with some of our speakers who have said that this is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| sure thing, and the presentation of the concept plan, I don't know, it's kind of a chicken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| or the egg thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I think I'd like to see a development like this happen, particularly if there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| consideration given to accessibility, and Mr. Jernigan and I talked about that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| afternoon, that we lack housing stock in our community that is fully accessible with universal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| access and threshold level thresholds and doorways that are wide enough and that kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| And for folks that are looking for that kind of housing, that could possibly be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| in this mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| But, again, it's a chicken or the egg thing, is this really the concept plan that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Well, no, because the rezoning has to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| And I would hesitate to approve a higher density within this neighborhood without some assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| of exactly what was going to happen with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| And I'm certain we can all recall some situations on higher density pieces of property where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| what was proposed there was perhaps not an addition or an improvement to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4524)|
| 1:15:32| So for that reason, I have hesitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| There is not currently a motion on the floor, and the appeal will die for lack of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4537)|
| 1:15:46| if there is not a motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| I know Mr. Jernigan is at the podium there, I'd like to recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| I think technically you actually have to ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| Mr. Jernigan, would you like to respond to the comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| You know, I agree, I always look at the staff recommendation and a number of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4563)|
| 1:16:12| I appreciate Councilman Roddy's comments, you know, there's so many positive things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| in this, yet there's nothing we can really put our finger on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And on two issues, the issue of the improvements to Sisk Road, as Mike Russo said in the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| report, and as I said earlier, the improvements to the intersection end about 700, 800 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| from where this property, the entrance to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| What I would ask, and the issue of how this development will move forward is a very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| legitimate question in today's environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| The ability to guarantee that a project can be built, candidly, we don't have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| to guarantee like we have had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| And we are in negotiations, and you'll notice the bottom of that drawing is labeled Wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| We are in negotiations right now with a partner to, a potential partner, to build these identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| units in South Knoxville, where we have approximately, we're asking for approximately 120 units in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| density on a project there, coupled with the 100 units here, gives us the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| get enough mass of product under construction that we can get the economies of scale and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| the capital needed to be able to move a project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| It is really that negotiation which is sort of critical to this first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| What I would ask as a possible suggestion for a motion, if this is able to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| Mr. Swanson, that a recommendation to approve the sector plan to allow a medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4663)|
| 1:17:51| residential zoning on first reading only, subject to approval of a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| and to be put forward at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| I guess my question is for Mr. Swanson, and that is, if this fails for a lack of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| that's different than a denial in terms of the ability for someone to come back and reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| this at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| No, I really think that's action on its merits, but to come back, all you'd have to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| change it in some respect, so, you know, it has limited precedential value, it only has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| precedential value for this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| I know on some issues that we consider, when there's a denial, maybe this is carryover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| from beer board, if there's denial, then there's a time period during which the applicant cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| A year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| So, if this is, if this appeal is denied, then this same request could not be made for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| a period of one year, but if it is, if it fails for a lack of a motion, does that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| year time period also take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| I believe that it does, but I would defer to Mr. Donaldson if he expresses a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| The MPC administrative rules have that same provision, so since the MPC denied it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| in the event that you didn't act on it, that denial would put in place the one year time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| I guess what I'm driving at is, if this were postponed, is there the ability for Mr. Jernigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4766)|
| 1:19:36| to enact a more binding kind of partnership with this proposed development partner in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4776)|
| 1:19:44| such a way that counsel might have more confidence in terms of what kind of development was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4784)|
| 1:19:53| forward, and that might not make a difference to my colleagues in this case, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| that there are some redeeming factors in this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| It's just that this concept plan is not a guarantee, and as I said earlier, I'm reluctant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| to approve a rezoning based on pictures and not reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4805)|
| 1:20:13| And I would like, if I may, just to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| If somebody asked you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Mr. Jernigan, is there any possibility that you could bring back to us a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| that was more binding than what we're looking at tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Yes, and the two issues that would go along with that, the ability to have support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| a rezoning, a change of the sector plan, gives the ability to actually get into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| negotiation to say, if we meet these criteria, there's a very good likelihood, and it enables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| the negotiations to really get quite earnest as to how the plan could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| But more importantly, I'm not going to go to a second meeting, I've made this comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| to several people here, to MPC staff, to the MPC Commission several times, I'm not zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| for some unknown event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| I am not going to zone a piece of property or allow a piece of property to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| I am moving forward based on the plans that I am showing that we are going to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| and then lose control of that deal before the zoning is accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| So if we don't reach an agreement before the next meeting, to be able to work in more conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| with the neighborhood to get them, maybe not completely happy, but to feel better about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| what the situation is, then I would withdraw the rezoning myself at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| And Mr. Juergen, I think there might be some confusion on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| I don't believe this is a two, you had said you thought this was a two reading, and appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| is one reading up or down, it does not have a second reading, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| I think, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Or does have a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Well, this is an amendment to a one-year plan, is what this is, and it's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| It's an ordinance that would approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Right, and I thought that just came by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Actually, the way I would think about this is the appeal moves it onto our agenda for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| first reading and sort of passes it on first reading, just like any sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| would be, and it would be a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Okay, so if the appeal is denied, it's done, if it's approved, then it goes for two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| readings, a first reading and a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| I think it is just, it will come back for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Back for a second reading if it's approved tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4943)|
| 1:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| That's my confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4948)|
| 1:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Just looking, it appears that Mr. Redmond is fidgeting like he might want to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| as all these other discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Is there anything on your mind, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| Counsel, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| I should have brought a few cards with sustainable development and a few other buzz phrases and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| nailed them on some of the existing houses in West Haven, because that's what's at stake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| It's not what he does or doesn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| Again, with the economic conditions we have in this town and with that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| whoever comes back, whether it's a government entity or a bank or another developer, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| a whole other story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| What you're doing if you open this up to medium density, you are threatening that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| If you don't believe that, let me take you on a walking tour of Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| Let me take you to 50 acres of low income, poorly maintained housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| Every developer I ever heard proposing one of these to a council had the same pleasant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| demeanor and great promises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| It's not that we believe or don't believe, Mr. Jernigan, that's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| We look to this city council to protect our neighborhoods at a certain level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| If you go in with what I call spot density increases, you're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| If you look at any of the neighborhoods in the northwest section, West Haven for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| years has been the most stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Why would we want to mess with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| Mr. Hall, I have to agree with Mr. Redman on a lot of what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5049)|
| 1:24:18| I talked to Mr. Jernigan about this project, and actually it does have some aspects that are very intriguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5058)|
| 1:24:28| I like the concept that he's doing or he's proposing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| I actually have some problems with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| I think that is just too intense for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| And this is coming from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| This is not something I normally take this position, but, you know, I've talked to lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| of people in the West Haven area, and they're just very concerned, not so much as for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5091)|
| 1:25:01| Mr. Jernigan would do, but what happens because the zoning, if we change this, the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| stays with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| And no matter how much confidence we may have, and I think Mr. Jernigan is as good as developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| we have going in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| But in these economic times, you know, which is very concerning to all of us, people just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| can't do what they would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| And the amount of density, the increase there is very concerning even to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| And I agree with Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| If you go around a lot of these apartment complexes in the Norwood area, they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| very detrimental to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| There still is not a motion, and seeing no lights, the Chair is going to declare that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| this fails for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Let me take a second of personal privilege, and we found out the BZA member that was replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5159)|
| 1:26:07| It's Betsy Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| So, and Ms. Mitchell, we have our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| 11A is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an amendment to the agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| the Public Building Authority of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| to perform project management services for city projects to include general provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| concerning compliance with federal regulations when federal funding sources are used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| I'm going to take a motion section real quickly and ask Mr. Jernigan if you have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| very briefly you want to say standing at the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| First off, thank you very much for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| The question on the denial, was that for the sector plan and the recommendation from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| Commission for the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| The rezoning is mooted by the sector plan, the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Because it's actually a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| The rezoning was 5.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| I think this is a more confusing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| There is a zoning request and recommendation that's consistent with the low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| plan designation on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Then that's not mooted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| So if you're following on your agendas, 12E is still on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| And do the folks who oppose that understand what's going on as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5256)|

| 1:30:28| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Mr. King, could you give us a little background on how we got to this point with these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| This property, these two parcels are in an estate that the previous owner or the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| passed away and there are no heirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| So the property went to the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Our law department and Mr. Maracle have been in contact with the state about how the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| would actually purchase that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| And we've been advised that we would need to actually name the state in the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| imminent domain lawsuit in order to acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| So it's in a situation where we have tried unsuccessfully to purchase property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| This is just the only avenue we have at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Mr. Toplin, I thought the state had sovereign immunity from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| How can we exercise imminent domain authority or Mr. Thompson, either one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| It's really with regard to the estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| And the estate is simply escheating to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| And so that's what you're really doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| The state is just the beneficiary of what happens with the estate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| But it is not held feasible by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| We can't really condemn the state property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| We can't condemn the University of Tennessee, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| But it's not held feasible by the state at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5522)|

| 1:34:18| I'd like to address this question to Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| I share Mr. Holquist's enthusiasm for the proposals in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| but I want to be clear in my understanding when I support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| that all of these projects still need to be vetted in terms of their affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| and final cost estimates obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| If one of these projects would not be affordable, say curbside recycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| how will the city then proceed, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| Yes, we're going to do a lot of research into the curbside recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| This is a preliminary estimate, and there will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| even with the optimistic estimate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| some capital expenditure that we would come back to council with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| and also some operating increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| But in doing so, we're going to take a pretty significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| and substantial look at a lot of things that this touches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| For instance, the existing drop-off centers and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| to see what cost savings are made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| And, of course, there will have to be contracts that would have to be bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Anything involving increased expenditure, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| would have to come back for a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| But beside that, something this significant will have to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| heavy involvement of council and the public through workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| and other devices so that this is just the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| of what will be a significant vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| So it's not a sure thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| but we're hopeful that we're moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| And one item of note is right now I think council is probably aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| that as far as recycling, the market is the bottom dropped out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| of the market for most recycled materials and plastics, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| So it's hopefully that market will recover in time for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| to get a realistic handle on what this really does for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| And I'd like to add to Councilman Holquist is exactly right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| that we think that in many ways is a positive thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| because we're taking a worst-case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| at the price we get for the recoverables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| at its bottom, what seems to be its bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| And as time goes by, if the market improves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| then the numbers will improve and the balance sheet will improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| and that's a lot healthier and safer than the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| Any more questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| Somebody from the audience, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| One down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| It is 837.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Stan Johnson, 2805 Woodbine Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| I'd like to know how many jobs this is going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| for low-income residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| Mr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| We don't have any idea of that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| though I would imagine that it would be an increase in jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| because there's a lot of sorting and so forth to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| with single-stream recycling, but there's no way to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| until more investigation is done into what this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Okay, because the Recovery Act is to create jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| and things of that nature, and I don't see any job creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| actually mentioned in this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| and I don't see any training for low-income residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| or any of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Well, this is a part of the Recovery Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| the Energy Independence and Security Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| that is specifically designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| to sustainability and energy projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| and there will be, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| a purchase of bins and jobs engaged in working on those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| and DOE has initially vetted that this is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| with the intent of the act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Okay, $700,000 for recycling, like Commissioner just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| that's bottomless fell out of that market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Is there any way we could change some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| to training and development of job creations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Would you have a comment, Mr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| or let me...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| I guess there are a couple things, Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| that I'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| The whole of it is a $2 million grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| and a lot of the other parts, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| some of the other pieces are going towards incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| for green building in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| and then also to supporting some CAC things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| and my understanding is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| what some of the other federal money going to CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| is providing job training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| and some construction work in green jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| LED certifications, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| I think a piece of what we're doing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| is trying to create more incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| for employment of people that have gotten training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| through some other programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| So I know some of that is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| I think it's a great question to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| and I guess I'm going to actually respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| to Mr. Lyons' first comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| You know, Mr. Johnson asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| are there jobs for low-income people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| and you said sorting garbage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| which actually gets a little bothersome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| and I'd like to challenge the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| to think a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| on how we do exactly what Mr. Johnson is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| is, you know, that the jobs for folks in the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| we need to think about them being carpenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and electricians, like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| and I know that was not intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| and I don't want to jump on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| but let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Well, just to follow up on your comments, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| energy efficiency retrofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| especially on single-family housing stocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| requires a certain skill level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| and you alluded to that in terms of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| and there's some training opportunities in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| I think, that some of that relates to it, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| But once those people are trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| it's actually a fairly labor-intensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| to retrofit these structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| It's a good, healthy kind of industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| because it is sustainable in and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| I think we all expect there to be more of that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| And then, of course, there's the solar, electric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| photovoltaic component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| which we are all hoping will be a growing component of our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| you know, the industrial and employment base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| of this region and this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| you know, with Vacker, however you say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| Vacashimi or whatever it is down close in Cleveland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| and then Hemlock Semiconductor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| you know, these new manufacturing firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| making photovoltaic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| So this, I think, points us in the right direction, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Yeah, I'd just like to see that more on your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| I mean, we're in a situation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| where we're not going to get this money back over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| We need to make good decisions on the money that we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| so we can make sure that it sustains us as a community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| I'd like to pass my agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| I was lost for which one we were on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| and I finally found it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| but in the back is a summary of what it's going for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| and I think if you go down through the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| and look at it and play that back to what his question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| I think you'll see that it will go to the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| of what he's looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I mean, there are a lot of jobs out there within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| that are going to go into the mix of these dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| So I'd pass that along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| $40,000 for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| Well, not direct training, but jobs which there will have to be training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| I mean, some of the private companies that will be doing the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| will have to do job recruitment and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| and some of those things within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| It won't be a direct city responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| but the money passed through will go towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| When I looked at this today, I thought the very same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| the question you ask, and I do see that the intent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| will ultimately go towards jobs and training and so forth like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| Right, but that's trickling down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| There's no intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| I mean, when you're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| it says clearly what these monies are going for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| but there's no intent to say this is what we're actually going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Like you said, we're still in research and talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| and thinking about, but what I'm saying is with money like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| it was meant to create jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| and this is not specifically mentioned in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| I called Dr. Lyons today and asked him pretty much these same questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| and I think if he had to answer the question over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| he might do it a little differently because I looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| through the same lens that you're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| You know, I look at this Jobs Recovery Act and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| and I wonder really, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| what kind of job creation this is going to ultimately do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| and I asked, I called Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| Madeline Will, who sent this, is out today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| but I got a very good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| I think the intent of this money will go towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| in this event, will go towards jobs creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| I just want it spelled out a little bit more clearly in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| because these monies are not coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| These are things that were meant to build our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| and if we're not talking about it currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| we're not going to mention it two years down the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| and that's not going to impact my community especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| I'd like to call on Ms. Rojero to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| She looks like she might have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| Well, I just spoke with Erin Burns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| who's working on this in Dr. Lyons' office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| and in the actual plan that the city will submit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| it does have to address the number of jobs that will be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| This is just a summary of the main projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| and how much money is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| but we actually do have to list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| based on the formula on the investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| how many jobs will be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| I just wanted the target to be known on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| I mean, it's just when you're initially going into something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| you go into it with an intention of doing exactly what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| Once it's breaking down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| it could go into all different directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| but right now it's not aimed at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| and if we were thinking about that on the front end of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| I think we'd come out better off in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090616?start=6252)|
