| 0:07:34| Health department? Sending a filing inspection and payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| Codes? No problem. Fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Ending acquiring a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Sheriff's department? No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Mr. Chairman. Mr. Brown. I'll make a motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| but then I got a couple comments after somebody seconds. With the pendings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| Yeah, with what's pending right now. Okay. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| All right, we have a motion and a second. Go ahead, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| This location is on your next page also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| The previous operator surrendered his license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| so we're going to ask that when it comes up, just be canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| But this is a turnaround for this location. I did talk to Mr. Carruthers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| He is the partner in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| And he owns two or three others in Maryville and Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| And this young lady has been running one of his stores in Alcoa before she moved over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| So, according to what he told me, she has an excellent record with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| So, we're looking for good things that somebody can turn around a problem child in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| So, you got big shoes to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| Now, we have a motion and a second. Any other discussion? All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Ma'am, you need to clear up with the health department and the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| And also, the clerk will need your certificate of registration with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Also, before you leave, the young lady with the blonde lady in the second row, hold your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=563)|
| 0:09:32| The other gentleman, I don't guess he needs to worry about that for his one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| But you need to see her before you leave because she's got a package for you that can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Yeah, she gave me the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Keep from coming back up here. So, under less than desirable circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=590)|
| 0:09:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Deferred consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| BP Food Mart, 3203 O'Marriville Pike, Anna Q. Incorporated, owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| I can't even talk today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Since this has been surrendered, I just move that we just cancel this item from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| All right. Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| I had a discussion with the law director and he advised that this person, since the license is surrendered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| and that's kind of where we would be if we did revoke the license, it would affect the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| So, this is the preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| So, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Is someone standing? Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Sir, we're going to take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Your license has already been surrendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| So, we're going to go ahead and take this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| So, you'll no longer be operating with a beer permit in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| We have a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Any other items before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=662)|

| 0:11:25| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Commissioner Stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Commissioner Schalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Mr. Presley, you're the first one to sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| I'm sorry that Sam's not here to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| I'm sure Sam don't want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, Knoxville, 3709.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| I was in front of the KUB board last Thursday, and they voted to raise our tax, raise our utilities again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| I mean, it was just so quick, and they know they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| That's why I'm here telling you I don't trust you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| You all don't want to help us, and we have to fight for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| I know I talked to one of your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| I said, are you here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| I said, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| He said, they're not going to listen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| That's why I'm going to keep coming until you listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| If you don't listen, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Because eventually, we all are going to have to listen to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| And this is what I complained to KUB about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| This big old article in the paper about why Y-12 said their program and everything they're doing is so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| If it's so good, how come them two nuns was able to get in their facilities and nobody detected them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| They got these uranium containers there, yet still they said it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| If them nuns can get in, a crazy person can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Again, like I told you before, they had an FBI agent following me, coming to my house, taking pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| following me here, and they're still doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| I'm going to give them something to follow me for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I'll be cutting the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| I hope he actually helps cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Again, I've said this for 60 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| After I leave here today, I'm going to mail this in 60 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| In order to get KUB to give us what we need and treat us fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| I'm using the Y-12 nun incident to get them to investigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| The Air Force got a plant out in Kansas where they said the uranium is leaking from the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| So we're going to try to get 60 minutes to come here to see if we can let them inspect Y-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| And in the process, that's when I'm going to say, hey, why are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Check KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| See if they're treating us fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| And if you're all a part of it, let's investigate you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| At the same time, WATE asked KUB for some paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| They sent it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| The guy for WATE said it's going to take them three months to go through all the paperwork they sent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| I asked the guy for WATE, why do you have to go away to Morristown to investigate their utility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Why are you going to do it right here in KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| He said it's so much paperwork, they're delaying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| But he said eventually they'll get to it, and we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| So all I'm saying is just try to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| And you all just want our votes and you want to help us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| and we don't even know where you're at in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| KUB digging up the grounds all over West Knoxville, and they're leaving potholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| they're leaving sink-sink storm drains uncovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And I complained to Lamar Alexander, I complained to Duncan, I complained to Corker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| and they sent them nice pretty letters back on their letterhead saying they appreciate me writing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| And that's all going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| But eventually, Y-12, we're going to have an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| And the investigation proved that if any leaks from that place, it can go from here all the way to the South Carolina coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| And then we won't have to worry about it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| So I'm trying to get you to listen to it now before it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| But as far as them raising our utilities, we're just paying for that ash field that we had a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| And they're going to continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| That's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| I'll be back next month and say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you, Mr. President.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Is there anybody else here for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=912)|
| 0:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| The next item is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| It's honoring the Knox County recipients of the 2014 Girl Scout Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Commissioner Brooks, would you like to speak before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| Unfortunately, none of the Knox County girls who received the gold award this year are able to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| They're all out busy doing their summer activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| And we are going to – each of them will get a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| We'll get it mailed to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| But we're very proud of our Girl Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| So I'd like to have this read into the record and just say that I'm proud of these girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| and I look forward to getting each of them their individual resolution before the summer is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Commissioner Brooks, do you know how many girls received the gold award and how many counties it covered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| No, I don't have a total number because, as you know now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| our Girl Scout Association is covering more than just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| It's covering a wide, wide area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| So we've tried to narrow this down to just Knox County girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| And we don't even have a total list of all the Knox County girls yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| But it's a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| There's a lot more this year than I've ever seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Congratulations to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Whereas at a time when this nation's youth face difficult challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| the Girl Scouts of America is one of our finest assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| providing young women with an educational program that contributes significantly to their character development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| citizenship training, and improved mental and physical fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| which qualities and skills will benefit them throughout their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award a Girl Scout can attain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| symbolizing outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| career planning, and personal development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| And whereas to earn the gold award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| a Girl Scout must build on her experiences in Girl Scouting to complete a gold award project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| that has a sustainable impact in her community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| And whereas the gold award project provides an opportunity for a Girl Scout to demonstrate extraordinary leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| organizational and time management skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| And whereas the Girl Scout award is an accomplishment achieved by a very small percentage of those who participate in Scouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| Now therefore be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| The Knox County Commission hereby honors the 2014 Knox County recipients of the Girl Scout Gold Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| for their meritorious service to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| congratulates them on their achievement of the Girl Scout Gold Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| and extends their best wishes for continued success as they pursue new challenges and goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| We've got a few more minutes. Chris, you can come down. We'll get an opportunity to talk about the finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| Anything change, I guess, trend-wise for the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| No, not particularly. We can go through it if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1125)|
| 0:18:55| The thing that we look at most, of course, every month in the luncheon is usually sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| So if you go to page two of your monthly financial update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| And also I gave you all a copy of the adopted budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| If you're probably like Ed Schall, she'll carry it around with you and always look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1154)|
| 0:19:24| You can see in the second box, as far as the projected surplus deficit goes on general fund sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| it improved a little bit, only by about $37,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| So we're projected to miss budget on sales tax by about $531,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| It's kind of stayed kind of constant. It's getting better, but it's not anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| I think it's about 7.6% off from what we had budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| If you go to page three, which is sales tax again, but this is the general purpose school fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| it got better by about $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| We're only running in a deficit by about 1.7 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| The reason, if you actually look at it, it's about 0.3% ahead of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| And the reason being is they get 72% from the city of Knoxville and 50% from the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| So where we saw a decline in county sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| their part is made up by the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| Going on to page four, engineering and public works, it's a little better, about $300,000 away from meeting budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1237)|
| 0:20:47| As you've heard me say time and time again, I always have a concern for engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| because there are two sources of revenue, sales tax and gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1253)|
| 0:21:03| School construction on page five is better as well, just $284,000 off from budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| That's better than what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| We've got two more months to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| But we considered May and June, which we won't get in until the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And so we'll continue to follow sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| I looked at property tax this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Current property tax, we're at 99.97% collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| So I would say by the end of June, we will be 100% collected on what we budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| And then what we collect in July and August will just be kind of gravy on top of that, which is perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| It will help offset the decrease in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| Positive news, let's go to page nine, hotel-motel fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| You see an increase there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Now we're showing a surplus of $152,000 in the hotel-motel fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1324)|
| 0:22:12| We'll do some calculations at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Forty percent of that will go back to visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| But it's always a positive to see a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| And we'll continue to watch that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| That's really good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Page ten is the will tax, once again positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| We're about $320,000 ahead of where we were a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| If you look at kind of the peach-colored column and you go to where the boxes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| you'll see year-to-date we're almost to $1,108,000, whereas a year ago we was almost at about $1,105,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1366)|
| 0:22:54| And so that's positive news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| I think I've said before I feel confident in saying we're going to beat the budget for the first time, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| that we've ever done that as far as will tax goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| And we budgeted for an increase for FY15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| You can go to page 11, and those three are just the courts following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And so, as we've discussed before, chancery and probate courts are behind collections of a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| and part of that is the new law on workers' comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| If you go to page 12, criminal and sessions court, $61,000 ahead of a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| And I can tell you that that office has also turned over $100,000 in excess fees, and that is a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1414)|
| 0:23:43| And page 13 is circuit and civil sessions and juvenile court clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| and they're about $91,000 ahead of budget, excuse me, ahead of collections of a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| And so that is positive news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| We will continue in the next week to close out this fiscal year as we go through our closeout process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| and then we will accrue revenue and expenses for 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| And then at that point, we will let you know where we end the year, whether it will be a surplus, a deficit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| or if I'm brilliant enough to hit it right on the head, but I won't cut on that last part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| Any questions or comments real quick for Chris on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| I think it's kind of more of the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Let me ask you something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| The $100,000 in Hotel Motel, $160,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| $150,000 ahead of last year or ahead of budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| And you give 40 percent to Visit Knoxville, and you give 10 percent to Knoxville for debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1480)|
| 0:24:49| Am I right on that 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Yeah, we give 40 percent to the promotion of tourism, and that for us is Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| And we give 40 percent for the retirement of debt as it's related to the History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1498)|
| 0:25:09| Then the county gets 10 percent, and then we give 10 percent to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| Part of the 40 percent that's to the retirement of debt goes to the Convention Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| and then the city of Knoxville piece will cap out at 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| And what we do on the Visit Knoxville piece is we budget a certain amount to begin the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| and then we pay that each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| And so once there's a surplus, then we'll settle up with them at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| It's not all a percentage. I always forget the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| It's not all a percentage. Over the 1.5 is basically the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| That's the city's piece where it maxes out at. That's the ceiling for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| All right, thank you, Chris. Sorry to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| All right, any others for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| We're going to go ahead and roll into the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Clerk, will you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Broyles, Commissioner Norman, Commissioner Ornby, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1563)|
| 0:26:14| Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Brown, Commissioner Hammond, Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1574)|
| 0:26:22| Nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Thank you. Motion on Commissioner Broyles, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| No, I just did it a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| Commissioner Smith, we'll go ahead and take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Remember, we traded, or I don't know that I traded with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Go ahead, Larry. I'll say a quick prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Father, we thank you for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| We thank you for the sunshine, and Lord, we just thank you for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Lord, I thank you for the employees that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I thank you for my fellow elected officials that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| and that their heart's in the right place to be a servant of you and for our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| as you're the great servant of your father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| Forgive us of our sins and guide us in the coming days and weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| In your son's name we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Amen. Commissioner Norman, would you lead us in the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| We give honor to our nation and salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1653)|
| 0:27:48| I need a motion for the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| We have a first and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1673)|

| 0:28:00| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Jill passed out the one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| It did not electronically make it from work session to our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| and it deals with the sector plan amendment 5D14SP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| in regards to the Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So we need to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Mr. Chairman, I'd move that it be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1704)|

| 0:28:27| We've got a few more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| We'll take them all up in one motion, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| Is there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Brad, you may already have this, but item 406 needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| It's for some additional items to the asphalt contract for use at Harrell Road Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| So I just want to double check and make sure you had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1739)|

| 0:29:01| We'll add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| In regards to a few zonings, if you guys don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| there's two zonings that are going to have opposition here this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| and both would desire a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| And if you guys are okay with that in this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| we can go ahead and notify those folks that they don't have to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Does anybody have any objections to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| No objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1762)|

| 0:29:26| Arthur, is yours Mr. Garrett's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Those two will be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| It's Volunteer Development and Philip Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| I don't have the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| It's on the bottom of page 16, and then the very last zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| So without objection, we'll go ahead and release Gerald's guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1790)|

| 0:30:16| and we are willing to accommodate that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| So we'd ask that one be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=1819)|

| 1:11:06| We will have to do a traffic study that will be submitted to MPC for their review and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| the county engineering, I'm sure, will suggest further improvements to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| There is slope on the property, so recognizing that, a lot of the property shown in the lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4278)|
| 1:11:28| here and at the top of the hill will be a non-disturbed area in accordance with MPC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| slope protection policy, and that has been discussed and is continuing to be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| When we came to MPC, Mr. Hughes and several other people had several concerns they expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4304)|
| 1:11:53| about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| One of them was lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| The lighting standards for the Technology Corridor Development Authority require basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| that no lights bleed off onto surrounding properties, and that will be part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| Technology Corridor Development Authority's review of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4337)|
| 1:12:17| These are all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| They're the same, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Five sheets or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| Pull them apart, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Well, we pulled them apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| We passed them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Yeah, it ran short on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Yeah, it's just one sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| Also, your map out there is upside down, according to our map here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4358)|
| 1:12:46| Well, north at the top, you are correct, which is the way you normally put a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Sorry, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| So the slope protection area will be here at the north and here, and there will be further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| revisions to that after we get a thorough topographic mapping of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| There was also a concern about noise from residents who live along the periphery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| At Greystone, they have, and this is reflected in the letters, they have a strict quiet time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| from 10 a.m. on at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| Stormwater drainage, Mr. Fulgham can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| That will not be an issue for any surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| It will be an issue that Greystone will have to take care of on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| The other issue was traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| That is an issue that MPC and the Tech Carter Development Authority, but in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| Knox County Engineering will address after the traffic study is finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| And then landscaping screening, we have met, Mr. Hinman has met with the neighbors over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| here and they have talked about at least a fence along this property and that they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| agree on what type of landscaping would be best for the neighbors to the west and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4449)|
| 1:14:18| the Greystone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| So that will come at a later date, but certainly will be part of the MPC use-on-review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4460)|
| 1:14:28| as well as the Tennessee Technology Carter Development Authority review of the plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4468)|
| 1:14:40| I sent you earlier Mr. Hinman's meeting minutes with representatives of the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| He continues or plans to continue interacting with them as the project goes forward because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4489)|
| 1:14:57| if you all approve this, then nothing can be done on this property until it has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| double review by the Metropolitan Planning Commission and by the Tennessee Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4503)|
| 1:15:12| Carter Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| So this is just the beginning of a fairly lengthy process that will not be concluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| until later in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Also, I would like to submit for the record an email from Dr. Campbell who lives adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| this property and his observations on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| I think he forwarded that to the members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4534)|
| 1:15:42| I'd like to, if I have any time, reserve for any rebuttal if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| Mr. Hinman and Mr. Fulgham are here for any questions that you all might have about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| issues as we look at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| Is there any questions of the applicants currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| The opposition, if you all would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| This compactor down here on the bottom, I'm assuming that's for garbage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4566)|
| 1:16:15| Yeah, trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| That'll be at the front of the property down there as you come in on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4577)|
| 1:16:28| Nice entrance by the compactor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| Sir, if you'll just give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| John Clark at 1146 Bishop's View Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| The only thing I really want to address, and I believe I've sent emails to a few of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| gentlemen, is concerning the actual road and one building location that is on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4605)|
| 1:16:54| on the slope area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| Everyone has a right to make money on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I think actually the complex is going to look quite nice from what I've seen from looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| at their other building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| However, I'll use their own diagram if you all can see it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| Ladies and gentlemen, this area right here, this road, if you can see it, this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| entrance into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| And there's units right in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| But this road right here comes right down the slope area, and you can see this is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| designated slope non-built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| This road right here all of a sudden makes a drastic turn and then it comes down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| The reason it's making that drastic turn, and I do know something about engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| I'm a consultant for the Corps of Engineers, I do a lot of their construction projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| is because this road cannot go through here without making this bend and still get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| one complex right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| These are barriers, these lines that you see right there, actually, I believe that, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| they to deflect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Can you help me with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| I'm not trying to use you against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| No, no, no, I can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| This area right in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| The retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| The barriers in the hill, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| No, those would be proposed retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Retaining walls, so it's restricting the flow from this building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| Mark, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Because if you didn't, on this hill right here, the flow wouldn't come right through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| this building, this complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| Yeah, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| And that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| The only problem we have, or I have with this, and some of our other neighbors have voiced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| the same thing to me, is this bit of road, because one, we don't really know the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| for it, because there's access to this area and this area on this other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| And the other is, why this building, or just a request to have this building relocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| this would offer a green zone, if you would, through this entire slope area, from the Bishop's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| view, it would almost be like a transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| I know that the, I believe, I shouldn't say I know, that the developer probably doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| want to take that building and relocate it over towards the commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| However, in the T&D meeting, when I spoke, I recommended that they try to, the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4756)|
| 1:19:26| move most of the development towards Lovell or in the northern end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| And they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| The development is mostly up here, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| However, they reserved this commercial zone, as you can see, towards Lovell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| I didn't, first of all, I didn't understand why they were all of a sudden telling us they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| were going to do commercial and multifamily housing in the same parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| I thought everything was going to be zoned for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| And if it was, I didn't understand why they didn't move this unit, specifically, over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| into that commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| The other problem that we have with it is the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| There appears to be only one entrance into and out of the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| And I believe there was, was it over 3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| The entrance that the address, you didn't get 3,000 travels a day to this one right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| here to protect you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Snyder Road's a small road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| The actual entrance that's proposed right here, the second house, over on Snyder Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| that's a little over the top of what we call the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| And I know that area because my daughter's already had an accident in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| And as you come up the hill, you really can't see what's on the other side of the top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| And if someone's either going left to center, or if you have 3,000 cars going in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| in one day, there's a high likelihood that someone coming down Snyder Road is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| T-bone someone else at the top of that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| Those are the only two concerns that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| I think the development, once again, to reiterate, I think the development would look nice, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| I think it would probably add something to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| But I do have a concern about this road and that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| I would request that the developer look at relocating that one unit complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| It is one of the smaller ones to relocate, if the diagram's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| And those retaining walls themselves look like they're probably close to, what is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| about 200 feet wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| I didn't put any kind of design into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| It looks like it probably, on scale, in which it would need to deflect most of that water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| about 200 foot in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| That's not real appealing from your backyard, that and that one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| If you'll consider that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Thank you, Mr. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Could you give your name and address to the engineer for the record, because you had some testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| I'm Billy Fulgham with Fulgham-McIndoe & Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| I'm the civil engineer for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| Hello, my name is Gary Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| I live at 1158 Bishops View Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| My property is directly adjacent to the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| And I would support all aid, particularly about the building that will wind up almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| in our backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| I'm concerned that a two- to three-story building looking in our bedroom window and across our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| back patio and screen porch would change our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| I'm also concerned about the density of this development and the hazards that it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| to create on level road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| We already face some challenges just getting out of the stop sign and trying to get over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| to, or excuse me, on Snyder Road and trying to get over to level road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| So I think it is really going to complicate matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| I think the commercial property, too, on the corner will create some hazards on level road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| There's a turning lane that allows traffic to turn on to Snyder Road from level road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| and having a commercial entrance along with an entrance and exit for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5003)|
| 1:23:35| property, this rental property, is really going to create more hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| I have to say that I have gone by the gravestone development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| It is a beautiful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| I hope that we can depend on folks, if this is approved, to continue to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| I am concerned about the potential to increase the height of these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| Again, I think it will just affect our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| They have a beautiful development in gravestone now, but there are no residential properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| immediately adjacent to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| So I am concerned about the potential to increase the height or increase the density beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| what is currently proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| I am also concerned about when we can expect to have the screening and the privacies put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| in place, the months of construction, and just the adjustment process is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| a big change for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| So I would ask for you to keep that in mind as you consider this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| I fully expected that that property would be developed at one day in time, but I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| expected that it would be something along the lines of what I live in, that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| be a townhouse or an individual home like what I live in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| So this is going to be a major change for us, and again, I appreciate your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| of our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Mr. Petrie, before you go, in explaining the, I guess you are over here on Bishop's View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5112)|
| 1:25:12| That screening will be mandated by the Tennessee Technology Corridor, and it is much more thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| than what MPC would provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| We can almost name what we tell them to plan on that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| So there will be more, if it is approved, there will be more opportunity for that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| of your concern to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5131)|
| 1:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Borderline there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| Is that wooded now, or is it open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| It's basically open right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| Towards parts of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Paul, you've got a step up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| You'll have to give your name and address, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| I'm Paul Henman from Columbus, Georgia, 6726 Standing Boy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| I'm with Greystone Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Using this, and get my bearings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| Yeah, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| There are probably six to eight houses here that run on existing pasture land, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| that there's a clear view from the back of their house, which is open pasture right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| As you get to the ends here, or down here, it's more wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| So I think that what my conversation with Mr. Hughes has been is that we both want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| to be screened, so that we both have a nice landscaped area to look out over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| Do you get that, Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| One other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| It also concerns me that there's one entrance to this place, and as the gentleman said a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| while ago, at the crest of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| I had a guy building a house on my road on the crest of the hill, and the workers were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| parking on the street on a little 15-foot wide road, and a guy whips around and drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5222)|
| 1:27:11| my daughter into the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| But that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Is there any way to make, you mentioned there was a turn lane up here coming off of Love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| along to Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| There's a red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5248)|
| 1:27:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Is there any way to make like a center acceleration, deceleration lane there at your entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5249)|
| 1:27:37| if you're only going to have one entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| Is there enough width there to make, is that what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| Yeah, and let me revise this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| This is what we had basically at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| There have been some changes, and this is basically what we're talking about is conceptual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| There will be a road coming, connecting the residential part to the shopping center part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5278)|
| 1:28:09| and there will be, this will be a gated community that have either the key card or the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| but that exit will line up with the street here on Lovell Road, so that will be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| exit from the complex on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| It will not be the primary entrance, as far as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| The entrance will be here on Snyder Road, and it's, again this is conceptual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| Knox County engineers will tell us where they will actually put the entrance at, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| it will be for traffic study and so forth, so whether it will be exactly there or somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5325)|
| 1:28:53| else is really hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| Well, I know that the center acceleration and deceleration lane work, I tried to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| out on John Sabir Highway, and certain times of day, if I didn't have that lane, I couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| not get out, so that's what I'm wondering, because, you know, in the middle, there could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| be an acceleration, deceleration lane for so many feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| If you all want to comment on that, City of Yonkee has not told them yet exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| they're going to have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| That is part of the use of the technology card or development card, and what road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5368)|
| 1:29:37| they will have to make, but they're certainly going to make sure it's the same entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| and exit from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| That's part of the traffic impact study, we're working on that currently, and it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| ready probably next week when we submit for use on review, but it's not ready at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| point, but we do have all the, have counted all the traffic, and it's in the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| being put together right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| So what I was going to ask was about that traffic, so we don't know the 3,000 you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| talking about, that will be in addition to what already is traveling that road, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| Keep in mind that 3,000 was a number that was thrown out early on, I think, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| know if MPC threw it out, I don't know if it was just a rule of thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| The traffic impact study will identify specifically the number of trips per day, that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| a number that was thrown out early on, but that's not the calculated number, it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| be more, it could be less, but that's not the exact number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| Typically, I think the traffic books estimate a single family home generates 10 trips a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| day, I think a condominium or apartment generates 6 trips a day, that's just an average, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5452)|
| 1:31:01| you would anticipate, what, 2,000 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| How many total units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| 352, but the traffic study will try to delineate that a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5467)|
| 1:31:18| You say you'll have that next week, or the next couple of weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Also, if you'd address the gentleman's concern about the retaining walls and perhaps moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| that unit, or I think that's what he had mentioned, was perhaps moving the unit over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| toward the commercial area, but also the issue with the retaining walls there, if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| address his concerns on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| To be honest with you, and I've spoken with him before, I'm still having a hard time trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| to figure out the concern he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| That unit right now is 40 feet below him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| The two walls will make that building 50, 60 feet below him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| Once they're screening along the property line, he would have to look either through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| the trees or over the trees, and the building's still 60 feet below him, and it's a two-story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| building, so I'm not following, and I just need to sit down and maybe, I'm just not following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5534)|
| 1:32:21| his concern on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| I'm not saying I disagree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| I'm just saying I don't follow it, because he's 60, at least 60 feet below him is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| that unit will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| But do you foresee drainage issues there or anything, or is it more just a view type situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| I don't see any drainage issues, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| What we do is we put a swell at the top of the wall, put swells at the bottom of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| wall, and this particular developer always wants a lot of drainage infrastructure so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| that there's no problem with it, and I don't see any kind of abnormal situation from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| civil or a technical standpoint, civil engineering or technical standpoint with that being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5578)|
| 1:33:05| There's nothing really odd about that, especially in East Tennessee with the two retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5585)|
| 1:33:12| The walls are stepped for aesthetic reasons, so it doesn't look like a big wall, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| still will end up being about 60 feet below those units over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| You may have just answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| The first was, is that this one structure in question, that's a two-story building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Because I was looking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| You see the 1120 contour line coming right about at the entrance, and then if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| at the closest home on Bishop's View Lane to the property line, is it about at the 1180| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5621)|
| 1:33:50| contour line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| So that's about 60 feet, and then I'm trying to get an estimate, just eyeballing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| how far that building is from probably the closest building on Bishop's View Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| We've got a 100-foot buffer with the dotted line that's marked, and it looks like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| about another 100 feet over to the closest edge of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| It's about 200 feet horizontal, 250 feet horizontal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5656)|
| 1:34:16| And about 60, it could even be close to even 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| It looks like it's even more than 200 feet if you look at where the closest building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| is on Bishop's Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| That's what I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5666)|
| 1:34:26| I mean, it looks like it may be 225 or 230, 250 maybe even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Okay, well, I think you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| That also, that's only a two-story building, so it's actually going to be looking, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| homes, even if it were completely bare, would be looking down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5684)|
| 1:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| Do you have any rebuttal or any questions or anything else that you'd like to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| I have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| Gentlemen, you normally don't build retaining walls just to spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| The reason you build a retaining wall is because you have a problem with water normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| or you have a problem with the leveling your land for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| And that is a 200-foot wall, and I just don't understand why you'd want to build a wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| if you didn't think there were going to be any problems there with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| And then you'd also take that road and you'd turn that road all the way around that wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| instead of taking that road straight down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| They can't move that building any closer to the east because if they do, they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| the slope protection area, and you can see the slope protection in those diagonal lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| that are already noted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| The main thing that we would get out of them taking that one road right there, this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| right here, if they took it out, and it's really, we don't know why this road is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| Because, as you can see, the parking's available for all these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| The parking's available for those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| And even if this unit was left, the access can be from this side right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| There really isn't a reason for the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| And this, if it's moved, this road and this building somewhere to the east, then this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5766)|
| 1:36:16| would be a, I mean, it's literally a perfect transition zone, like a green zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| And the tree area, the tree area in this property right here would be, if you look, my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5781)|
| 1:36:31| actually is right here, we're number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| And I know what, how tall that building is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| Is it two-three or three, one-two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| It is, it's just a two flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| I know the drop, and he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| There is a drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| However, the drop that we have from our home right there, believe me, is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| 60 feet below our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| I don't care what those lines show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| I look at them every day on site plan and construction plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| And that's all I'm requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| You know, if this would, you know, if y'all would take that under advisement to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| relocating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Yeah, before you leave the podium, what's your concern about the water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| Because it looks to me like that's all downhill in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| It's all downhill, and any water would be going into the units that are downhill from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| that, and it shouldn't be diverted over toward Bishop's Lane because it'd be going uphill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| No, I'm really not concerned about the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| The water is not going to come up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Could you talk into the microphone just so we can hear better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| The water's not going to come up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| I'm not concerned about that affecting Bishops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| I actually have some concerns of what it might do as it comes down the hill on their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| but that's, you know, what they need to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| That's their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| But what I am concerned about is trying to keep that green zone in there without that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| road and that one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| Because literally that one road and that one building is the only thing that keeps having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| a total transition zone from Bishop's Court, from single family to multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| I don't think anyone in Bishop's Court of my neighbors, and we are the ones that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| backyards face that, would have any problem with the development other than the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| And that's to be determined, you know, on the entrances, except for that one building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| and that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| I have one other question that could be to the engineer or someone on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| That road that does come down, it looks to me like it's not serving much of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| but from the development that's uphill from there, I mean, it doesn't cut that much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| off, but is there a reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| I asked Mr. Hinman and he said he would have no trouble eliminating that road at the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| department and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Fire and police or sheriff's department has no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5946)|
| 1:39:13| Just in our prior experience, sometimes emergency services like to have that type of interconnectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| If that can be accomplished by having some type of turnaround at each one of those cul-de-sacs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| we're perfectly fine eliminating that road and providing another access there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| But the purpose was generally just to provide that interconnectivity that we have generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| found emergency services like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| I think these gentlemen are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| For our residents, it doesn't serve a particular purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| About the only people, it would be a shorter trip down or maybe the two buildings on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| upper development might be a little bit of a short cut down, but otherwise, I doubt if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| there's going to be much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| For our residents, it's not really a useful road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| We provided it just for interconnectivity in the case of emergency services would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| That's something that we could eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| Subject to that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Commissioner Norton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| The civil engineer again, is it Mr. Hinman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Billy Fulgham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Fulgham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Mr. Fulgham, would you address his, I think the issue besides just the road, that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| unit, which, how many, I mean, that particular building with the double retaining wall, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| building would have 10 units, 10 dwelling units approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| Eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| So, if, you know, for a complex this extensive, 352, for you all, I mean, I don't even get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6048)|
| 1:40:57| it, with all the trouble that you'd have to go to with a double retaining wall and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| an excavate, I mean, that's a big deal to put that unit right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Why do you want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| I mean, eight more units is important for the, you know, the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| The retaining wall is, this particular developer would rather put in retaining walls so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| the parking lots can be flatter and have a smoother transition between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| And, you know, I haven't done the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| It may be that we can slot it one way or the other once we get into the details of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6090)|
| 1:41:39| But to omit that particular unit, that's not really a consideration on your all's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| You want to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| You want to have this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| You might be able to move it a little bit, but you want it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| I appreciate your concern, too, and the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| The thing that we went through for years, it seems like, when we were doing slope and ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6127)|
| 1:42:16| was intended, I think, to help us cluster so we could get off of slope and ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| And I believe I tend to agree with that still yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Actually, we do not have a motion before us, and this is a sector plan vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| And so this item, although we've discussed the zoning and the merits of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| this will be the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| So do we have a motion on the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6165)|

| 1:43:05| Request of Angela Elizabeth Willis and Allison P. Cornell for rezoning from A. Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6185)|

| 1:43:16| in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Mr. Law Director, we approved the sector plan change, and the applicant left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| Do we need to suspend the rules since they were in attendance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| I think this thing got out of sequence on here, so I think you can go ahead under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| circumstances and move on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6216)|

| 1:43:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I move that this be approved per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6221)|

| 1:43:54| 5-E-14-RZ is a request of Scott Lee Goble for rezoning from A. Agricultural and A. Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6234)|

| 1:44:11| 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| This is the same that we just did previously to that on the rezoning matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| Is there anybody else that would like to make a comment or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| What's the one condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| We already talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| There should be no land disturbance until a use on review has been approved and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| there be approval by the Tennessee Tech Carter Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| That's a condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Thank you, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| I'm not interested in putting this in as a condition, but can we say that you'll take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| a look at the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| Because I think both of you said that you really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| If we can eliminate it, it saves us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Well, I'm going to suggest that that be part of it is that you take another look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| I'm not saying you have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| I'm just saying just please take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| We have a motion on the floor to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Brad, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Arthur, I can vote for this in reference to what Commissioner Wright had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6313)|
| 1:45:24| If you look at this in terms of the intent that you all had was to respect these slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| and so on, but that one unit is the one that stands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| If you disregard, I mean, other than that, I'd say you all have done a very good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| apparently, at trying to respect that principle of what we're trying to do with slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| And so, I mean, I can vote for it, but I would like for, I hope that your folks can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6353)|
| 1:46:02| at the possibility of reorienting that unit or eliminating that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| And I don't think that's a great, it doesn't seem to be a great subtraction from the complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| given 352 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| We're certainly going to take your comments into account in looking at that unit and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| I meant to ask this question earlier, and I'm getting old and forgetting things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| If you do eliminate that unit, do you still have to have the retaining wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6396)|
| 1:46:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| We don't have to have the retaining wall if that unit's removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| So, as was pointed out earlier, a 200-foot retaining wall, and I don't know what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| other one is, another, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| There is an offset, there's a cost offset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| Well, I mean, there is, I'm sorry, there is a possibility that the walls aren't needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| I just haven't done those calculations, but I wanted to show them to the owner so he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| have those in his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Once I get good topo and start doing the detailed design, we'll try to, regardless, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| have tried to remove them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| I just wanted some walls in his budget, especially with this being East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| I'll make the motion to approve the zoning with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Graham, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| Looking at your map, here's, I understand what some people have said on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| Whether you have that building or not, but looking at that diagram there, and if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| a resident, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| I think that ambulance services and fire, they're probably going to have to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| I would presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| But more importantly, I look at that, that makes a loop, and I'm thinking your residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| would like to use that as a walking trail, if nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| They would walk on that at night and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| But even if you take that building out, I would still keep that road, and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| make a great place for people to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| And we're going to be balancing all this as we go forward with our submittal to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| and I'm sure we're going to get a lot of comments from them and from Mr. Johnson for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| the Tech Corridor Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| We're going to be trying to weigh all these factors as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| Looks like you could do a 5K in there, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| It's a big piece of property, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| The periphery, how far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Over a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| The periphery's over a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| That just makes a great loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| If you take that road out, that just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| All right, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Okay, we have a motion and a second for the rezoning per MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140623?start=6542)|
