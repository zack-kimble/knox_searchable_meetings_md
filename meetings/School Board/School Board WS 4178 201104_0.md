| 0:00:30| I'd like to call this meeting to order. We'll have the moment of silence and pledge led by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| Take a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=37)|
| 0:00:46| Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=46)|
| 0:01:09| Welcome to the Board of Education's November work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| We appreciate you being here and being engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| And also, our newly elected District 6 Board Member Betsy Henderson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=75)|
| 0:01:24| And we wanted to say congratulations, Betsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| And we all look forward to serving with you. Glad you're here tonight. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| A policy review meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, November 18th at 1.30 and a meeting packet will be made available as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=96)|
| 0:01:47| The special question committee will meet on Tuesday, November 17th at 4 p.m. to certify the poll results from our professional employees regarding the continuance of our collaborative conferencing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=107)|
| 0:02:03| Also, the Joint Education Committee will meet on Monday, December 7th at 5.30 in this boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| A meeting agenda will be published as we get closer to the meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| After our two-day work session that we had in September, we were talking about the vision and mission a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| And so, we probably won't do it every single meeting, but we thought we would really try to spotlight our vision and mission statement at several of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=143)|
| 0:02:35| So, I would like to refer to Ms. Babb, and she's going to talk about our vision and mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| Sure. Our Knox County Board of Education's mission is to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=161)|
| 0:02:51| I want to focus on the part of our mission that talks about empowering all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| One way I feel like Knox County Schools exemplifies this is through some of our alternative schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| When we say we mean all, we mean from any socioeconomic level, any type of family, those with mental, physical, and social special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=183)|
| 0:03:13| We're here to take care of all students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| In Knox County Schools, we offer several non-traditional schools that help those students who are having behavioral issues, have special physical and mental needs, and those who need a more focused alternative route to graduating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=196)|
| 0:03:26| I've been able to visit Ridgedale Alternative School, Richard Yoakley Transition School, and KEC, which is in my district, since being on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| I've been so impressed with the dedication of the administration, staff, and teachers of these schools who go above and beyond to meet the unique needs of these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=214)|
| 0:03:43| We also offer the Kelly Volunteer Academy for high school students who are seeking an alternative from the regular classroom setting, but wish to graduate with a high school diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| and Fort Sanders Development Center, which caters to our youngest students who have social, emotional, and physical special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| I just wanted to focus on that because I really do think it's important for us to just point out how we are able to really, you know, reach all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=238)|
| 0:04:08| And while we're a big district, I do think that's one of the things that enables us to do is actually offer some things that some of these smaller districts are not able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=248)|
| 0:04:17| So, that's my focus today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Okay, thank you so much. We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Do we have any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Okay, and now I would like to refer to Mr. Thomas for the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| A few updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Some of this is going to sound real repetitive, but I have found that repetitive is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| So, I'll repeat some of it again, and maybe you've heard that a lot, so you may tune out some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| Again, I just want to begin by reminding families of an important deadline that's coming up very quickly regarding the semester that begins on January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| Families who want to change their learning model in the spring semester from virtual to in-person instruction or from in-person to virtual instruction must fill out an enrollment form by 3.30 p.m. on Friday, November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=311)|
| 0:05:25| 3.30 p.m. Friday, November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| That is this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| We've reminded you several times, but one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Probably remind you a couple of times before Friday, too, but I'll do that less publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| Just to be clear, again, that deadline is 48 hours away or less than 48 hours away, so families who want to change their student's learning model must do so quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=339)|
| 0:05:48| The enrollment form is available on our website, www.knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| Families who are unable to fill out the online form can get a paper copy at their school or a printable form on our website, and printable forms are available in six languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=355)|
| 0:06:06| Families that have multiple children in Knox County Schools should complete the form for each student who will change their learning model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| Again, multiple children complete a form for each student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Also, please keep in mind that families who are happy with their learning model do not need to take any action, so if you're happy, you do not need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| As a reminder, report cards from the first nine-week grading period are now available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Because we've heard from principals that students in the virtual program are not doing as well as those learning in person, we did a quick look at grades assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=391)|
| 0:06:39| Remember, I think I told you at the four-and-a-half-week mark, this is what it looks like, and we'd look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| Our research department did not do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| This is just me looking at nine-week grades, taking, I think, 14 of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| I believe I looked at six elementary schools, four middle schools, four high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| Again, in northeast, southwest, urban, suburban, rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| So, just a cross-section of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So, a sampling of district-wide data reflects that out of all grades assigned in the in-person platform, 9.4% were Fs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| And out of all grades assigned in the virtual learning program, 21.5% were Fs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| So, the proportion of Fs assigned between in-person and virtual actually widened when compared to the grades assigned at the 4.5-week benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=437)|
| 0:07:28| So, just keeping that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And as I've said before, our virtual teachers are doing an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Very pleased that we're able to offer the virtual option for families who have health risks related to COVID-19 or other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| But at the same time, please keep in mind that students who have the greatest success in the virtual program are those who benefit from a strong structure at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=463)|
| 0:07:52| And also, they are highly disciplined and self-motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| As of this afternoon, more than 4,400 requests to change have been submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| Among those, approximately 3,700 have requested a change from virtual to in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| And approximately 700 have requested a change from in-person to virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| So, in closing, I also want to say congratulations to Mrs. Betsy Henderson, who was elected yesterday as the new 6th District Representative on the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=493)|
| 0:08:24| I know you will do a great job, and our team is looking forward to working with you to support students, employees, and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| So, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Madam Chair, members of the Board, that concludes my report for this evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going to remember one of these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| It's all good. It's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| I know you can't speak to this from a data standpoint, but just anecdotally, do you have a sense of how many kids who are in-person, how much the quarantine is impacting them around their grades?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=527)|
| 0:09:00| I've just heard different stories about kids who get really off track during that quarantine period and what kind of strategies we're using to bring them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| I do not have any information along that line, although John, maybe our research department can sort of take a look at that in terms of looking at grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=549)|
| 0:09:19| And what I have done is very unscientific, and I think Dr. Reisman and his team would probably say, hey, that may be pretty flawed what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=559)|
| 0:09:27| But, again, just looking at the grades that have been assigned is where this information comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| And I know REA is going to be looking at this much closer and much more scientifically than what I have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| But I don't really know, but we'll be glad to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| Do you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Here are several changes that we have to our several of the items that I want to go through before we begin reviewing the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=594)|
| 0:10:06| With the approval of the law department, item 9C1 is for your ratification dealing with an MOU with the Tennessee Department of Education that Superintendent Thomas and myself approved by executive committee action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=606)|
| 0:10:21| due to the required state deadline, which occurred last Friday, October 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| Mr. Dupler, please correct me if I misstate anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| But to summarize this MOU, it is an extension of our current primary partnership agreement with Lincoln Memorial University and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville for our educator preparation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=631)|
| 0:10:44| This MOU will allow LMU and UTK to receive grant funding from the Tennessee Department of Education designated to offering opportunities to our educational assistants to retain certification in the areas of special education or ESL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=644)|
| 0:11:01| And it is at no cost to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| And when we get to this item, both Mr. Dupler and Mr. Bolton can answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| Is that sufficient for the moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Okay, so we'll get to that item, but that just explains why that is for your ratification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| We have a change on item 9D4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| You should have received an email on this earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| This is the agreement with Hunter Valley Farm for Powell High School's 2021 prom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| The agreement has been updated to reflect the vendor's new refund policy if the event had to be canceled and also clarifies that the agreement is between Powell High School and Hunter Valley Farm and not the school sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=696)|
| 0:11:50| And we can ask questions when we get to that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Under board policies, item 10A, which is the second reading of policy I-341, the uniform grading policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| Our curriculum and instruction team noticed a correction was needed on lines 21 and 23 on page 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| When the policy was issued in 2018, it stated that quality points of 1 and .5 would be added for an F grade for dual credit enrollment or honors courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=732)|
| 0:12:26| But that is not correct and should have reflected zero points for an F grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| Dr. Reiswick will be happy to answer questions when we get to this policy, but the error did not affect any of our students and the amended policy attached has those changes incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=751)|
| 0:12:44| So we needed to make this clarification because it's currently on our agenda for second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=764)|
| 0:12:53| Two more. We're almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| On item 10F, referring to policy J-151, on line 32 of page 1, there is a singular pronoun referring to he and it has been recommended that it be updated to he or she as is used consistently throughout the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=775)|
| 0:13:13| So that amendment is also redlined for our consideration and once again, this policy is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| So that's the reason for the additional information right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| For items 10I and J, the board approved amendments on first reading offered by Mr. Watson to provide accountability by requiring list of the applicable coordinators to be maintained by the director of school culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=805)|
| 0:13:42| When the amended motion was approved for policy J-580, Ms. Owen made a friendly request to include that the list shall be updated to at least annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=822)|
| 0:13:54| So to be consistent, the words at least annually have been included in the second reading of policy J-400 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=834)|
| 0:14:04| So those are the updates that we have and if you have any questions on those, just hold them and we'll discuss them when we get to those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=844)|
| 0:14:18| I think that we've already approved the agenda so we will go ahead and begin discussion on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=858)|
| 0:14:28| Do we have any questions on C-1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Go ahead, Ms. Babb. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Yes. On this program, I know we've talked about it but I really don't understand it completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=875)|
| 0:14:43| How this differs from kind of what UT is already doing or what LMU is already doing and also I noticed that I think it starts in January and goes through the summer of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=883)|
| 0:14:56| So it seems like it's a year and a half program. So I was just wanting to make sure, are people able to get their certificates or whatever they need in that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=896)|
| 0:15:05| So just a little bit more explanation would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Absolutely. Madam Chair, rest of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| This agreement is actually, this memorandum of understanding is intended, it was a federal grant that was applied for by the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=913)|
| 0:15:24| We wrote, Bob signed a letter of support and what this does is it basically pays for the hours for a person already having a bachelor's degree to go through the process of getting their initial licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=924)|
| 0:15:37| Call it job embedded program or anything like that where they have to take those required education courses so that they can become a teacher of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=937)|
| 0:15:48| And so when we looked at this program currently in our Grow Your Own program with UTK, we lay it out as three phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| The first phase is already underway with our aspiring teachers and the internship and shortening that time to become, to get a livable wage for those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=956)|
| 0:16:07| Second part is identifying talent inside with teachers assistants that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| And the first round of that would be those that already have a bachelor's degree, which would be job embedded placed people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| So what this does is this gives us two programs for them to choose from in which they could go to those programs at no cost to achieve their certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=980)|
| 0:16:31| So for like a TA that's choosing to do this, how long would it actually take them to get their, I guess, teaching certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=991)|
| 0:16:40| It really depends. It has to do with the programming that's provided by the educator prep program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| There's really not a lot that we can do in terms of that program short of the approval that they go through the state process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| Some it can be as few as nine hours. Some it can be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| They go through a transcript analysis to see the classes that they have had, to look and see if there's any prerequisite courses that would suffice some of those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| And then once they go through that process, then they'll take a, once the transcript analysis is completed, then they'll look to see what are the classes they need to fulfill those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1027)|
| 0:17:17| Okay. So it's very specified for the person looking at what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| Okay. Because the little bit of concern I had was, I mean, I totally support this. It's not that I don't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| But when I looked at the timeframe of the contract with it being a year and a half, I was just concerned that people even could get their certification in that year and a half before the grant ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1047)|
| 0:17:38| Typically, you're looking for a job-embedded program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Typically, the time span is about a year and a half for them to get those prerequisite classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| Seems like it depends on the EPP, whether it's going to be a cohort model or how they will go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| But most of our job-embedded folks will complete their program requirements in a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1076)|
| 0:18:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Okay. Mr. Watson. Mr. Bolton, don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Is the hope that this would expand to other universities and higher educational institutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Well, the grant window has now closed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| So that would be great if that were the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| And we don't know if it will be renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Yeah. Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Okay. All right. Seeing no more questions on this one, we will move to the first item in contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| Do we have any questions on 1, 2, or 3, or 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1118)|
| 0:18:55| Okay. Moving to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Any questions on A or B, C or D, E or F, G or H, I or J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1137)|
| 0:19:19| Okay. And then any questions on any of the three grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| Okay. Moving to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Any questions on any of the three contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Okay. And then regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Items A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Yes. On D, and this is probably for Mr. Bolton, I was looking at the salary attached for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1188)|
| 0:19:57| and just wondering if that is, or I think that's a full package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Is that correct on the funding item for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| That would be based on average salary with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Okay. And so is that a kind of a top, I mean, is that a salary dependent on qualifications for the position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| Correct. And looking at, of course, there's some factors that would go into playing where that would fall on the salary scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| So that's why when the budget department looks at that FTE, they look at an average salary with benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| When the budget department looks at that FTE, they look at an average, when they budget an average amount for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| Okay. And then is Mr. McPherson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| And you might not have the answer for this, but I think this is, actually, it's my fault that I should ask you for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| because I think August numbers have come out, haven't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Because I know this kind of is reflective, this ask on the fact that we think numbers are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| If you don't have this information now, could we get it for next week about sort of how we're doing budget-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Absolutely. We'll get the detailed projections to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Yes, we've looked at, so we did get August, and it is, again, showing a surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| We can extrapolate that all the way out to the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| We're a little nervous about saying what we think that will be other than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| because there's so much that could happen between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| It is showing a considerable surplus, though, but we can get you hard numbers in our projections based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| So August looked really well. Also, July looked fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| August did not run to the surplus that necessarily July did, still surplus, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| If we could get that by next week, because I think we keep kind of making decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| because we were so conservative because we had no idea what was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Things are obviously better, which is great, but we keep having things that we're going to make decisions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| So I think if we can have a sense of really how we're doing and then look at things like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| and the fact that we last time approved for the insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| and just how those numbers are affecting us and how we're trending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| We can do that, and we can actually even have a list for you if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| So one thing to keep in mind is not only is revenue at a surplus of what we had anticipated at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1332)|
| 0:22:20| but we budgeted conservatively, so we budgeted $4 million more in revenue than we did in expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| So essentially what we were doing is budgeting to put dollars into our fund balance account, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| But, yeah, we do have some COVID expenditures, quite a bit, and I went over those before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| But we think we're in pretty good shape, and so, yeah, we're kind of keeping track of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| So obviously we can't just go keep throwing things at the board that, hey, everything's great and wonderful, because that's not what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| And I'm sure you're keeping up with that, but I think there are things that we all would love to add back into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| So I think just as we can all have a better sense of really – I think we're all thrilled how well the economy is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| We hope that it continues. But to really have hard numbers that we can look at would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| We can give projections. We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| We can list our estimated COVID expenditures so far, and we can also put down what the board has already approved, like the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| And so we'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| OK, thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Any other questions, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Mr. Bolton, we're not going to let you sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| So I know that this position is tied to our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| I mean, it's an important piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So can you speak to the additional value that we'll have in having a position like this, how it plays into our strategic plan and what we can accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1409)|
| 0:23:38| Absolutely. I think we had this position previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| It was lost because it was vacant at the time that the budget came through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| We saw a lot of improvement, a lot of research in that position in terms of really –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| our goal is that our teaching demographic or our certified staff demographic will match that of our student demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| And so I talked to Bob earlier about our numbers of diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| And I think – Bob, I think it prepared something to – I want to steal his thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| Just for a minute, if I can weigh in, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Of course, in the plan, we talk about using multiple strategies to recruit and retain experienced educators at our high-need schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1455)|
| 0:24:23| We also talk about increasing partnerships and outreach efforts with historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| and to also increase our certified staff of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| And approximately, just to give you some idea of where we are right now, approximately 17 percent of our administrative promotions this year were African-American promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| That represents about 14 percent of our school-based administrators in terms of being minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| Approximately 6 percent of our certified staff are minorities, while our African-American student population is approximately 17 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| So in looking at the differences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And then when you look at our Hispanic student population, it's about 11 percent and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| And our Hispanic-certified staff is approximately 1 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| So you can see, again, the differences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| So we just need to do more in our efforts to recruit and retain employees of color so that, as Scott said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| our certified employees more closely resemble the diversity of our student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| And so we feel like with this position, it's going to help us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| And, again, there's some additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| You had a job description attached there, but just let me kind of expand on a couple of things in there with the job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| To design and develop and implement an approved educator prep program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| To work to expand the educator prep program into other high-need subject areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| Also to build a teach-as-a-profession program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| And what that is, what we hope to do, is identify students at Austin East and Fulton who have an interest in becoming teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| We would then provide some early college opportunities for these students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| with the expectation that these opportunities would help compress the time that it takes to get a degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| Because going through UT, you're talking about a five-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| So if we could compress that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| And then upon successful completion of the program, students would then be hired to teach in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| So this is something, we talked about this years ago, and it never was able to come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| But with full scholarships, four-year scholarships being provided for students at Austin East and Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| it's now a reality to identify those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| And we know that in recruiting, what is the mileage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Probably 300 miles if you're recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| Most people don't relocate more than about 300 miles, maybe from where they grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| So if we can identify folks that live here, grew up here, to be in our teaching staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| then I think that's a good way in terms of growing your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Also, we have a recruitment there, and this person would be responsible for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| And then we're looking at revamping our hiring process in terms of making that more transparent process for applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1625)|
| 0:27:17| If you're a teacher and you aspire to get into an administrative position, how do I go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| What is that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| And, Scott, we can do this for the board sometime maybe a little bit later to talk about how we're revamping that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| to make it a lot more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| So this person would work within that process and also be responsible for sitting in on interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| and helping to make decisions for promotions and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| So I think if it hadn't been for the budget situation last year, we thought we would have never done away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| We worked really too hard to get this position in the budget and then to lose it, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| for very good reason from a standpoint that we didn't know where we would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| So it made sense to take vacant positions and eliminate those at the time and then come back and restore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1682)|
| 0:28:09| I really think that in terms of our efforts in human resources to have a person dedicated, full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| go to bed thinking about, wake up thinking about, hey, what can we do as a school district to recruit minorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| and to retain our minorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| And, of course, part of the strategic plan, we talked about the Minority Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| which we've had a few meetings already this year, and that group is very interested in working with HR too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| and this person in terms of recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| And they've really helped us come up with some pretty good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| I know our last meeting was very productive when folks talked about some of their ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Hey, have you thought of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Would you be interested in doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| And, yes, we are interested and we want to do that because we've got to work on these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| and have a certified staff that's more representative of our student body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| Well, I'm very appreciative of you and the team identifying this as a strategic need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| to bring back in to the board for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Do you know which of our high schools has the largest Hispanic population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| since that seems to be the really big gap that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| Are you talking about the teaching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| No, student body-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Student body-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Which high school would have the largest Hispanic population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Just by ethnicity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I was just curious if we know if it's Fulton or Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Dr. Reisman, do you have a quick answer or just a good guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| I'll give you two answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I'll be impressed if you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| So, the largest by number of students, Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| The largest by percentage of students, Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Wow, I'm impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| I guess the reason I ask about that is when we're looking at the Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| and Austin East program, it does look like we really are trying to target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Hispanic that maybe Central maybe should possibly be taught about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I was just going to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| I mean, good news, I'm a dad of two kids at Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| So, I'm super happy it's a flagship school now for UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| Full rise, that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I didn't know that was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| So, I mean, I think we've always kind of talked about those kinds of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| and that, so Scott could look at it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Let me say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| The main Austin East growth is in Kurundi, so it's a very different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| like refugee populations that's driven up that ELL population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| So, yes, it's kind of unique at that school for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| Scott and I did have a conversation about that this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| so I think that's a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| But now that Central is into the mix in terms of the full four-year scholarship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Yeah, that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Okay, any other questions on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Okay, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| We are on E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| Jennifer, there's that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| In the charter monitoring report, I'm looking down at the bottom at the suspension rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| the student attrition rates, and the teacher retention rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Do we have any comparison to past year numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| I mean, we have the past year's monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| It's very difficult for us to draw comparisons because the number of days that we're using is so different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| that it really is not an apples-to-apples comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| So we're hesitant to do too much with that number other than continuing to work with Emerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| That is an area where they're putting a tremendous amount of time and focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Any other questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Moving to F, G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1919)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| And then Lonsdale, H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| I've asked, we've had some questions on Lonsdale and the number of classrooms and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1936)|
| 0:32:26| So I think Mr. Oaks is going to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| And if you'll just kind of walk, I think you're aware of kind of what the questions from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| and what some of the staff questions have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| If you'll just kind of walk us through the kind of how we got to where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| and what the conversation is at the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| And I'll start and talk about it at a very high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| If we want to get into details, Mr. Dillingham is here to talk to program standards in detail and process in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| And Ms. Thompson is here to talk about curricular aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| But some of the questions that we have been asked have been around the number of classrooms that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| have been around ELL, have been around presence of a tech lab that immediately come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| And I just want to say when we begin and we build a school, we build it to the board's program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2000)|
| 0:33:28| And those standards are designed so that every school that we build in the county will have the same elements within it at the same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2008)|
| 0:33:39| So that an elementary school that we build in Lonsdale has the same elements within the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| within the structure that an elementary school that we would build in the northwest part of the county would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| or in the northeast part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| So when we begin the process, what we do is we'll look at our growth projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| And right now, just to give you some context, and these are based on the middle of September numbers that we pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2043)|
| 0:34:12| Lonsdale, and when I say Lonsdale, I'm talking about Lonsdale and Sammy Hill as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| but Lonsdale had a K-5 enrollment of 453 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| We're projecting over the next four or five years that they will grow to about 510 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| So that's a growth of about 50 students over that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| The current school, as it's designed, has 30 classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| And it also has, if I can remember what I'm doing here, it also has, of course, art, music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2081)|
| 0:34:53| It has two CDC classrooms, which are part of our program standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| Of course, it has PE and a library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| And when you look at that, you look at the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| When we calculate capacity for an elementary school, when we're in the construction phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| we look at grades K-3, and we calculate a capacity of 20 to 120 students per classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2111)|
| 0:35:20| because that's the state maximum BEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| When we look at grades 4 and 5, we can make that calculation at 25 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| So that gives you a straight building capacity right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| As we know, there's really not any difference in a third-grade classroom and a fourth-grade classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| as far as facility is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| So just for a shorthand, internally within the office, we may use a number of 22.5 per classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| to give you some approximation of what the capacity of the facility is or what the max capacity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| And you remember back when we had the board extended work session a month or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| we talked a little bit about capacity and how capacity is calculated and the different ways you can calculate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| But based on that, what we've got right now is a calculated capacity of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| as it's currently designed for 675 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| Some question about the tech lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| We haven't designed schools with tech labs in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| I think we're confident that being a one-to-one district now, all of our classrooms can become tech labs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2193)|
| 0:36:42| and all of our students can work in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| With respect to Mr. Dillingham, I'm probably going to ask him to speak to this in a little more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2206)|
| 0:36:58| But when we look at ELL, ELL is not a component of the program standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2218)|
| 0:37:06| It doesn't mean it can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| That would really take a recommendation and an action from the board directing us to include that as program standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| You can make arguments why it should be a program standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and you make arguments why it shouldn't be a program standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| based on how the ELL program is implemented at various schools around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2245)|
| 0:37:36| With that, if it pleases the board chair, I'd like to let Mr. Dillingham talk a little bit about the program standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2256)|
| 0:37:46| the design process, and where we are in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Certainly. That would be great. Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2269)|
| 0:38:01| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Our program standards were established back in the mid to late 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| and I'll tell you, they were Cadillac at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Over the years, at the direction of the board, we have gone in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| we have taken a look at where we could trim square footage to save construction dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| It's all based on the cost of construction, which I think most people will know can vary at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2307)|
| 0:38:36| What we have right now is standards that we have downsized classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| mainly by taking out some of the cubby areas that we used to have designed in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| teachers' office areas, and this was done probably five or six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| probably even longer than that, when we were designing the Carter Elementary School project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| We have tried to maintain those standards since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| We still look at it on a school-by-school basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| With these standards, they are very explicit as far as what we provide in each classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| the number of outlets, the number of data ports, and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| It's extremely explicit. We do have to massage it every once in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| The bottom line, where we are right now is that our classrooms are pretty much interchangeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| We especially had to do a modification for Lonsdale because we are building two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Our previous standards, the K-1 classrooms, were a little bit larger than the 2-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2386)|
| 0:39:53| but when you are building two-story and you are stacking them, you have to make them all the same size from a construction standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| What we did was we downsized the K-1 a little bit and we upsized the 2-5 a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| so that they are the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| It's something that we could probably build one of each side-by-side and take in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| and you would not be able to tell the difference in the two unless you started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| pulled out a tape measure or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| We feel very confident with the classroom sizes we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| That is not only something that we implemented at Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| but we also have included it in our Adrian Burnett project and our Northwest Elementary School project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| Classrooms are all the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| As Mr. Oaks said, our program standards define components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| and we put those components together to best fit the site that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| We are trying to make sure that everything is equivalent across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| and that has been our intent since I have been with the school system for a little over 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| Mr. Oaks mentioned ELL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| ELL is different at every school or can be different at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| It is actually a pull-out program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| so it is not a part of the program standards where you identify classrooms for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| It is something that is addressed at the school level on how they use their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| I will let people a whole lot smarter than me talk about how they use facilities at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2497)|
| 0:41:46| Lonsdale being unique in the fact that we are combining Sammy Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2506)|
| 0:42:02| which previously was a pre-K facility and now contains pre-K classrooms along with K-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| we tweaked our program standards on this project slightly to include some pre-K classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2530)|
| 0:42:18| Ordinarily on a 600-capacity elementary school, we would design 10 K-1 classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2538)|
| 0:42:30| What we have here is we added two classrooms to the standards to take care of pre-K classrooms that exist at Sammy Hill now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2550)|
| 0:42:42| Again, that is an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| We do not have pre-K everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Pre-K is not a part of our program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Pre-K classrooms are the same size as kindergarten classrooms and the same size as first grade classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| so they are all interchangeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Again, it gets back to the use of facility as determined by the local school administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| Any questions on any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2586)|
| 0:43:17| Mr. Oaks was talking about the ratios of 25-to-1 and 20-to-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| I know at some of our higher need schools, our ratios are a lot smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Is that the smaller ratio or is that what we are using across the county as our ratio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Because I would think our ratios would be smaller at Lonsdale, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| We are directed under our current direction by the board to design the program standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| which call for us to design the BEP standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| We are designing to the 20-to-1 capacity at K-3 and 25-to-1 at 4-and-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2628)|
| 0:43:57| We do not take into account staffing ratios or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| Again, we are trying to standardize across the system, make sure everybody is getting basically the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| and that is the way that you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| I guess that is a little bit of my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| We are saying standard across it, but we already know what the Lonsdale community is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| We know a lot of their uniqueness, like their very high ELL population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| Why are we not taking some of those considerations in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| I know Mr. Oaks and I had this conversation about an ELL classroom can look the same as a first-grade classroom or second-grade classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2674)|
| 0:44:42| This is where I am hearing a lot from the teachers and administration and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| but I don't know as a board member how they are using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| When I look at the classrooms, it looks like there are 30 classrooms. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| But because of their population, they are staffing at a lower ratio and feel like they will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2696)|
| 0:45:08| Things like that, I guess it concerns me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Maybe you all can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| If you already know that no matter what, we are going to tell them whether it is right for your population or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| you are going to do 25 to 1 even though you have never done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| That is what is concerning me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| I think we are confusing design and operation a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| Understand, too, that staffing ratios can change in any school from year to year at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| That is not a static number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| What is static are the bricks and mortar, largely speaking, and how you have to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| Can we consider those things? Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| But I think it requires the guidance of the Board of Ed for us to do it because it is outside the program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| We can do what the Board of Ed wants to do with respect to that or whatever the sense of the Board is with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| Let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| I have talked about this a time or two before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| Normally when we design a school, we will design expansion space into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Lonsdale is not different in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| We have designed expansion space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| If the Board wanted to provide Lonsdale additional space, and I am not arguing that they do not need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| but because Lonsdale is somewhat anomalous, particularly in its ELL population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| I think they probably have the highest per capita ELL population of any of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2798)|
| 0:46:46| If the Board wanted to look at that, it would be giving us a direction to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| We have the contingency to add additional classrooms, and we could do that within this current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2815)|
| 0:47:05| but we did not feel that it was our place to add six classrooms or add eight classrooms that were outside the program standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2825)|
| 0:47:17| But if the Board wants to do that, that is certainly something that we can do at the Board's direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| I guess I feel like I need more information about how they currently use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| because I think my biggest fear is we look at our portable situation all over the place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| and I do not want three years from now that school to be surrounded by portables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| That is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| There is no room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| You get what I am saying, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| We do not think it through enough to do the expansion, and I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| I am not an expert in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I am not the expert to say, oh, yes, they need the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| But there are a couple of other things I wanted to ask about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Let me answer one thing before you leave from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| If you want to talk about operation of the building, I know Ms. Thompson and Ms. Parton are both here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| and they can certainly address that and discuss that in some detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Perhaps that would help if we hear from Ms. Thompson on the current number of classrooms that are utilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| or if the principal is here, the current number of classrooms that are utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| and how ELL is happening and to kind of get a sense of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| And if we feel that 30 is going to meet the needs for the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| Whoever would like to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| And then I know we have other questions, so just kind of hold your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| and let's see if maybe some of them are answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Because I know I have a lot of the same questions you probably do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| I will just talk a little bit about what it looks like now at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| We have, and this is two through five, not considering Sammy Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| We have currently five teachers who they have classrooms that can be anywhere between about nine students on a low end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2943)|
| 0:49:13| to up to about 14 kids on a high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| And they are in a portable right now, and some of them have to share a portable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| and some of them do have a portable by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| But there is some sharing there, some love there amongst themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And so they have about five rotations of that many kids in a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| So they literally have a classroom that functions throughout the whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| They'll meet with group one, which could be anywhere between eight and the 14 children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| two, three, four, five, and then to give them the planned time and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| That's for a full day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| I believe there's about 144 kids that they serve altogether, two through five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| So when I think about that and I look at the new school that we saw and the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| first of all, I'm super excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| We feel like it's Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| And I look at what we have now as far as the number of grade levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| It appears as if we have about three classrooms that could be what I call repurposed or looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| even though it said first grade or second grade or third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| We have about three that I could have that discretion to use for an ELL room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| We have two CDC classrooms in there that it's possible that one of those could be used for that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| just kind of thinking it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| So that would be a possibility of about four classrooms that we could look at and kind of change it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| And so that's kind of what I'm looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| I think there would be seven total ELL teachers when the two schools combine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| So that could look like would you have a classroom per teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3062)|
| 0:51:09| Would there be some sharing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| Would there be some possibility with technology that we can use to kind of create spaces within those spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Those are the things that are the challenges I think that we would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Well, and can I ask a question about if you have five to 14 kids per classroom, if it is one teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3082)|
| 0:51:31| do you need the same space as a regular classroom that is built for 20 kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| Or could a smaller space work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Like is it, you know, I'm just thinking about could the space be, if we can reconfigure that space, would that be beneficial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3099)|
| 0:51:50| It would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| We have some interventions that kind of run that way too for RTI where they have that, you know, about five to six kids in a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| So space-wise, we could make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| I think the teachers really, they are like classroom teachers at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3122)|
| 0:52:11| They really run a program where they have whole group, even within those number of kids where they will teach a whole group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3131)|
| 0:52:20| and then try to actually break out in small groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| So that does take some space that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| So to have a table with, you know, 12 kids in a smaller space might be hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3146)|
| 0:52:34| You know how a classroom teacher would like that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| Plus, you know, I can meet in small groups here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Do you have any other questions, Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| So I think what I'm getting from you is how y'all currently use Sammy Hill and Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3171)|
| 0:53:00| you're not going to have the space currently as the school is configured to do it the way you're doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| You would have to reconfigure groups or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Is that kind of what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| We would, with the four rooms, we would have to look at somebody having to share space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| and maybe using technology to have, you know, presenting content the way teachers do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| whether it's an active board or, you know, a media TV or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| and creating space where they would still have to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| But there could be possibilities where one or two would be able to have that full space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Because, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| So four classrooms between seven teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Well, you're up here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I guess this is another question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| I actually, a few years ago, before community schools started in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| I went on a field trip up to Cincinnati, and it was, we kind of looked at their model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| and their whole thing was they built their schools to work as community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| and they were doing a huge building, and, you know, it was really cool what they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| because they were starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Basically, they just start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| So as I'm looking at the fact that we're building a new Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| do you feel like the school has the space needed to work well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| with the community school needs that are working there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| That's a hard question to answer because we saw it just for the first time on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| I know that there's that section right there that could be used for community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| and there's the rec center there, and just kind of trying to get my bearings on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| so I don't know that I can fully answer that because I know there's still some conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| you know, what does that space look like right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| So, you know, I'm talking about the, I call it the hot pink space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| That's where, I mean, I think Ms. Satterfield brought this up a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| of really hoping that we were going to the community and going to the school as we were designing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| and I sort of feel like we have designed the school and now y'all are looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| I do, before approving this, I wish, and this is not probably you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| this is probably talking to the design people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| that we're really making sure this does work for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| I mean, if we're going to spend this money, let's do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| I mean, you know, obviously we have budget constraints and, you know, you can't just do whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| One other question I have is with all this one-to-one technology that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| we didn't have this years ago in elementary schools, and when we taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| and this might be a Mr. Dillingham question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and we're talking about the standards that we had, as we're going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| are our standards meeting the needs for all this technology that we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| in all these elementary schools that we've never had before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| And this is kind of a new question as of this summer with all the one-to-one capability that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| Are our schools going to keep up with all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| Well, and Michael, I have a question that may be related to that because I think I heard you say, Mr. Dillingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| that a few years ago that the board's direction was to decrease the cubby space and the teacher office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| So I think the cubby question could come into play in that because, as a principal, I would like to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| and you can, if they're not related, answer, we can answer that question and come back to this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| but I'm just curious, you know, how do you, does that work for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| for classrooms to not have a cubby space and a teacher office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| And I know Mr. Dillingham has some conversation on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Okay, so if we can just kind of address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| And I would love to hear from the principal on that question too, but Mr. Dillingham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| if you want to go ahead and then I'd love to hear from the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Okay, as far as the technology is concerned, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| I think we're staying up with the times, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| We have a tremendous IT group here with the school system, and they go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| we put in the number of ports, wireless ports in each classroom that they recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| they test it, they make sure it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| And as far as I know, we've got all the bandwidth that we need on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| and I think we're fine with having everything one-to-one and wireless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| which has been talked about for years, and we're finally at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| Now, to address the cubbies, the cubbies are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| They are not in their own little special section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| What you will have, and you can go to NSKIPP Elementary and take a look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| Moreland Heights, what we do is we put the cubbies along the corridor wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| if you will, down low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| They have coat hooks underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| And then we put enclosed cabinets, wall cabinets, actually two rows above that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| and take them all the way to the ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| That gives them some out-of-season storage up high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| That gives them some usable storage down below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| That gives each student a cubby plus a place to hang their backpacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| We actually have measured and we installed the bottom of the cubby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| so that the coat hooks underneath work with the backpacks on the individual grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| And so would there be a space there, like if they wanted to store their Chromebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| that they could store the Chromebook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Well, Chromebooks are kind of new to us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| The cubbies are basically 12 by 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| I don't know if you want children storing their Chromebooks in that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| but I think it would accommodate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| And what about teacher offices, Mr. Dillingham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| That's something that was changed several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| I don't know if you remember when Dr. McIntyre was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| and we did a lot of traveling around looking at different design of different facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| because we were being told that we paid way too much money for our facilities, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| So we walked into, you can take a look at A.L. Lott's Gibbs Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| was probably the last one about 14 years ago that we designed with the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| Most of the offices, the design were two classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| and created a suite that had the offices in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Well, we found that the offices were being used for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Storage, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| And the teacher wanted the desk out in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| So that was one way we cut out the offices, the cubby space and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| and saved a bunch of square footage doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| So that's how we were able to massage some of the square footage out to get construction costs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| And some of that storage, the upper level cabinets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| so the thought is that hopefully that's going to suffice for the storage issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3603)|
| 1:00:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| With the lack of having that space between the two classrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| The space between the two classrooms was never designed for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| It was just used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| We actually designed some storage closets in that same space going across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| and I would venture to guess that the amount of actual storage that you have in those cabinets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| would be equivalent to the closet that was in with five shelves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| I'm not sure who had a question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Ms. Satterfield, it's your school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Yeah, I just have a quick question as they continue to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| and this is a very specific question, so if we can just get an estimate that works, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| But since the program standards were first in the 1990 date to now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| what has been the ELL population growth throughout the county since the 90s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| Do we have that estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| I don't have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| and I don't know if we could go back that far and find the ELL population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| but I would hazard a guess that it's been significant for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| We'd be glad to take a look at it and see how far we've come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| It probably is pretty much significant across the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| and so I will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| We can continue to have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| but I am interested in adding ELL board standards into our board standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| because I do think that it's going to be something across the board for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| as we continue to move, but we can continue to have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| I have several different questions for different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| First, I want to just clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| What you're looking at now at Lonsdale is five classrooms that you're using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| for ELL rotation, second through fifth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| so that's not including kindergarten, first, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| I mean, kindergarten and first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| It's just second through fifth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Right now we have portables behind there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| and there are one, two, three, four portables out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| and each of the teachers have a space in a portable, but we have five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| and the fifth one has to share amongst those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| so there's times when there's two groups going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| and they have a connector space between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| and sometimes they're pulling students to work in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| to have some separation from the other group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| So let me say that a different way then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| You currently have four spaces and you need five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| but the new plan only has three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| Three classrooms that were the pre-K through five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| and then we have two CDC rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| that we could probably repurpose that into something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| And where is your RTI intervention meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| So there is an area in the bottom part of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| that has a lot of itinerant office space, suites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| Counselor, there's some room in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| that we could actually have small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| and kind of look at some of the other spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| for the itinerant folks to do their small groups for RTI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| since they kind of stay in that small group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| and don't really move around as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| as what would happen in a general classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| So you feel like there would be enough space for your RTI folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| I think so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| Do we know when the program standards were last updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| when those were looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3843)|
| 1:04:12| Ms. Soren, the last time that we took an in-depth look at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| was when we were designing the Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| So four, five, six, seven years ago, seven or eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| Carter and North Shore were built at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| and we went through at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| and did a very in-depth look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| So that was the last time that we have gone to that depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| on the program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| As I said, each time we design a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| we're always looking for ways to be able to save money on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| And so we're constantly looking at what we can massage a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| And also, as I said, the program standards establish the components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| but the components may go together differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| depending on our site limitations and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| So you're not always going to have the same design at every site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| And sometimes just the design itself has an effect on how you do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| and needing to massage things a little bit to make them work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| from a construction standpoint, constructability standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| And I appreciate the effort to look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| that we no longer need to save those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| And it makes sense to me that we might not include a technology lab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| because that's something that's becoming outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| But I think as we're looking at those things that we no longer need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| there are other things that we are growing to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| And while it's a great effort to look at those things where we can save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| there may be some places where we need to spend more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| And I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| We have inserted some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| What comes to mind is geothermal, the use of that in our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| We added to our program standards just a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3976)|
| 1:06:21| that we would take a look at geothermal on all of our projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| to see if it was feasible to see if we could get a return on investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| So it's very general, but it's specific that we have to look at it at each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| And in my opinion, if we do the same thing with ELL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| it's not a part of the program standards that we have to include in every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| but we look at it on every project to see if it is needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| and whether or not we need to add space to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| So the main reason it's not in there right now is because it is pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| Lonsdale has a tremendous population that needs the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| which is unusual for Knox County and some of our other elementary facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| So that would be my recommendation is a direction from the board to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| rather than mandating it through program standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| where we have to put it in every school where it may not be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| So again, going back to the question about the actual space that's needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| we can design smaller spaces for these pullouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| In my opinion, if at all possible, you're better off if you leave them classroom size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| so that it just adds flexibility to the use of your facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| So you may not need it all day every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| but at the same time it gives you some flexibility for your student-teacher ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| And it gives you some flexibility for intervention, for ELL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| but it also gives you the flexibility that if your population starts growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| then you already have the classrooms there to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| And then you're back in the boat of trying to find some place to do ELL intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| I guess my next question is for them to have direction to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| do we need to at the next meeting actually look at a potential motion to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| or would they just need sort of consensus from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| as they're talking about things to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Well, you all are proving tonight what's my understanding is a preliminary schematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4137)|
| 1:09:05| And Mr. Hoeks can correct me if I'm wrong, but changes can still be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| But I think if you're going to want Mr. Dillingham and Mr. Hoeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| and their teams to go ahead and positively take a look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| then you all need to probably add that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| I mean, from what I can tell, and again, Mr. Hoeks, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| the board could approve this preliminarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| but also ask that the ELL space be looked at in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| Yeah, let me do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Just a little clarification and then I've got a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| With respect to the schematic diagram, this is not preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| I mean, it is, but it does not mean that what gets built is down to the nth degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| what's in this drawing because as you get into the process, you may have to tweak that some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| But what happens at this point is the board approves the schematic diagram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| and then the architects can go back and start doing construction drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| We can get, in this particular case, because remember this is a design-build project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| that's being managed by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| They will have to go back and, of course, do the construction drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| the estimates on cost so that they can put that together and provide it to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| and we can review the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| So that's where we are in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| and that's really the impetus behind approving a schematic design for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| With respect to ELL, Mr. Dillingham and I have had long conversations about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4251)|
| 1:10:59| I think I had a passing conversation with the superintendent about this the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| and he can shoot me when I get off on the wrong foot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| But I think at this point in time, the most expeditious way forward is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| if the board would direct us to build out Lonsdale Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| to add an additional six classrooms that are already within our expansion vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4285)|
| 1:11:34| and include that, it would take Lonsdale to, by the way we measure it, an 800-student school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| It's got an 800-student core designed already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| and what it, for all intents and purposes, would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| is it would max out Lonsdale Elementary School and that site forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| We could never come back and really do anything else to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| So if you directed us to do that, then there's a cost to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| We don't know what the cost is yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| We won't know until the contractor can go through the process and cost that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| I can tell you that we're comfortable that we've got money in the total project budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| to cover the bricks and mortar, regardless of what that cost comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| Where we may be 18 months from now down the road is needing to put some more money in that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| in order to cover things like furniture fixtures and equipment, some technology, some security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| if there are those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| How much that is, I don't know yet, but we would need to adjust it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| and I'm going to refrain from speculating on what the cost might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| because as soon as I do, I'll get it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| But I think that's the most expeditious way forward with respect to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| I think if you do that, you also need to direct us to take a look at Adrian Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4380)|
| 1:13:09| and see if it has a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Like the Lonsdale plan, the Adrian Burnett plan has an expansion vision to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4392)|
| 1:13:21| that we could look at that if we needed to add some additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Anybody in the construction industry will tell you that it's cheaper to add space right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| than it will ever be in the future while you're mobilized to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| and while you're still moving lines on paper and not moving blocks on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4420)|
| 1:13:47| So that would be our suggestion and our preference to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4427)|
| 1:13:54| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Ms. Owen, did you have all your questions answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| I was just going to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| That is something we would need to direct next week, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| So I think we would make a substitute motion or add to the motion and vote on it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| And then we have a – Mr. Dillingham just reminded me –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| and then once we do that, that gets these two projects moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| We've got direction to do those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| and then we can have a separate conversation or a separate process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| about how we want to amend program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Ms. Jerks, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| I've talked to Mr. Dillingham quite a bit about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| and that was going to be a suggestion that I would consider that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| for the very purpose of it will never get cheaper to build out that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| And if it's space that we can use, even if our population growth doesn't dictate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| you know, you said in five years we might be at 550 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| But from a programming standpoint, I think that's really important to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I've got a few comments that are more broad about the way we're designing and constructing in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| I know in the construction industry you all have tremendous amounts of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| and competing interests and all those different things that you'll have to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| all the way from the site that we're on to regulations to who the stakeholders are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| So, I mean, you all have a tremendous amount to navigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| and I appreciate you all doing that for our students and for our parents and for our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| I'm assuming, I don't know this to be true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| but I'm assuming that when those design standards were approved in the 90s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| and we moved to more of let's try to make sure that every community when we build a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| has pretty much the same thing, and that comment has been referenced a few different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| is because our lower income communities probably were not getting very good schools at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| I'm assuming historically that was what was happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| or at least that was the concern of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| is we can't give a lower income community less than what we're giving a higher income community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4553)|
| 1:16:00| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I'm sure it has something to do with disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I don't know. I wasn't here then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Thomas was around, but I don't know if that was even in his area of responsibility at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| It could be what I can tell you based on the anecdotal information we get today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| Every area of the county thinks some other area of the county is getting more than they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4583)|
| 1:16:31| I don't think that dynamic has changed in the last 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| Yes, that's probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I think when we go that direction too far, we actually end up underserving people unintentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4598)|
| 1:16:48| because we don't always consider the unique needs of a given community when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| I'm not saying that you guys are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I'm just saying from a philosophical standpoint, I think sometimes we miss the mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| and I think that's why we've had so much conversation tonight about ELL when it comes to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| Mr. Dillingham, you had said the last time we looked at these were about six or seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| When you say we, who do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Has the board presented the program standards in that amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| When I say we, I mean me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| I'm probably the only one in my department of three that has the capability of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4648)|
| 1:17:38| It was presented to the board basically as a part of the Carter package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| and so kind of in a roundabout way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| I don't know that we actually presented the standards to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| If we did, I'm not real sure that anybody read it because they're about that thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| But at the same time, they were presented to the board as a part of that Carter package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| and the Carter design and was approved at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| But in the 90s, the board did take a deep dive into it with support and things like that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| They actually hired Cotswinkley, Jones & Morris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| who is an architectural firm that no longer has a presence in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| They're down in Mount Juliet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| But they hired them to put together the standards, and they dealt with Ms. Sarah Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| And even today, even though Ms. Simpson is no longer with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| I still cringe when I think about modifying the program standards in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| I'm afraid she's going to come back and haunt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| So I'm not going to speak in layman's terms, so excuse me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| But if we have a set of program standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| and let's say that sets the minimum standard for any particular school given the grade band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| is it possible that in addition to that there could be something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| again, this is where I'm going to use the wrong terms, a la carte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| where it says given the unique population of this community, we might also then add in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| We might take a particular look at ELL or this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| Does that make sense of what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| I think it's very doable to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| Again, if it's left general so that we don't have to include it in every design that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4764)|
| 1:19:31| then I think it's something that we can take a look at on each specific project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| to see if there is actually a need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| And here's why I think that's an important consideration as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| I know one of the other issues that I heard in this particular process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| people in the Lonsdale community, many of them felt like they didn't have a voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| and they weren't able to speak into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Well, I think part of the reason why we do that practically is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| you can't have 50 people who don't know about construction telling you how to build something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Oh, yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| But it's not very effective or efficient, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| That's why we have the program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| And that's usually what I tell people when they want us to include something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| something different and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| I say, well, we have the standards that we design around so that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| regardless of where you are in the county, you're getting basically the same facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| It sounds like I'm trying to solve this, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| I'm kind of giving some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| My thought is if the program standards were more about the minimums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| and then you had this a la carte given a community-specific needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| then you could involve some public process in that to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| all right, given your particular needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| what are the additional things that we've already accounted for as possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| could be added into the mix of the design of your school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Yeah, and I will tell you that normally we at least, I will say in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| in COVID-19 had an effect on these projects we were doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| In the past, what I typically try to do is schedule a meeting to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| and present what we're doing to a regular PTA meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| and have the staff show up as well so that we do get the feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| not just from the staff and the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| but also the people that are highly involved in the school itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| which is typically what you find with the PTAs and the PTSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| But even with the ability of getting some of that feedback at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| the community could not possibly suggest a major change that we might take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| I mean, it would be fairly minor things that we might be able to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| Right, and what I try to tell our designers when they start designing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| our program standards are actually guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| Again, if you know anything about design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| as you start putting together the pieces and the parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| exact sizes don't always work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| and especially if you're dealing with masonry and modular components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| So instead of 25 feet, you want it to be 25'4",| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| because that's your block portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| So there are different things like that that the smart guys, the architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| they know all about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| So there's some tweaking and adjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| and then how things fit together at corridor intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| and things like that that you have to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| You may not be able to get 100 square feet in a space that the program asks for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| but you may be able to get 97 square feet in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| So they are guidelines, and there is room for adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| Part of my job is to review these designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| and make sure that they are going to function for our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| and our staff that we put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Well, thank you guys for the work that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Again, I would advocate that we look for some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| to be able to involve more public in the process in tangible ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| and then also look at how can we move from a minimum standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| to also giving some flexibility, more flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| where the people who program those schools and the communities themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| can have some input in terms of the additional items in the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| We have Ms. Fab and then Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Okay, and I'm not going to try to run this on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| but I really agree with what Mr. Watson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| And I have to say I think about half this board probably was involved with the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| Were you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Okay, a lot of us have never gone through this process before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| and I have to say I think almost a little education for some of us on how it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| because I feel like I'm learning as I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| Be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| And that maybe is my own fault not to ask the questions ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| but, like, I look at the fact that we had the community meeting the other night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| and then we're all of a sudden voting on it, and it feels very rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And I look at, like, Adrian Burnett, and maybe it is the COVID times that are causing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| and I think Adrian Burnett is much like Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| in that you've got programming that's already going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| They know how they kind of run their school, what they need, that type of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| And I really hope that, especially as we go to Adrian Burnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| we really have those conversations with their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| and with their leadership teams and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| because they know how they use their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| And so I guess I would like to kind of, as Mr. Watson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| try to have some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| but look at how we really need to do it correctly for that group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| and try to do it as best we can at the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Like we've said, it's much easier to build it out now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| or not easier, but than to ever add on five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| And I'd remind you, the board's already approved the schematic design for Adrian Burnett Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5094)|
| 1:25:01| So that project is further along in development than this project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| It doesn't mean that we can't go back and make changes at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| The other thing, and this comes from 40 years of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| of trying to manage projects of different types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| is I learned a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| you never go to a committee meeting with a blank piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| You'll never get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| So our program standards allow us not to have a blank piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| And we can certainly do whatever the sense of the board is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| I would just caution that we don't want to get ourselves into a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| where every time we build a school, it's a new experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| It needs to be consistent in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| Yes? Okay, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| I just want to make a couple of comments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| some in reference to how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| I mean, two or three times things have been mentioned about the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| I think on the heels of the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| what we were trying to find, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| was some uniformity where maybe that we could use, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| if we had a school that we were building for 500 to 800 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5185)|
| 1:26:33| in one part of the county, we could use a similar design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| And now I've had, and I still have one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5198)|
| 1:26:47| A lot of these elementary schools were built by the old WPA during the 30s and the 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5207)|
| 1:26:59| Corrington is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| They had the same, generally the same design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| There were six rooms with eight grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| And we've got portables at Corrington, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5234)|
| 1:27:21| But I guess what I want to say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5241)|
| 1:27:31| I would prefer that we stay general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| I think it's worked real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| They built, when I say they, I'm talking about Russ and Doug and others that are under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5259)|
| 1:27:50| They built two complete schools in the last, oh, decade in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5270)|
| 1:28:00| And they've also done major renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| Now, you correct me if I'm wrong, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| Major renovation at Rita and some renovation at Chilliwa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5287)|
| 1:28:19| Although Chilliwa is not in the District, we send our kids down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| And I've never had anybody complain to me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| So I guess what I'm saying is don't get into the minutia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| I understand what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| And people should have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| But at the same time, keep in mind that these are professional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| They know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| But you've got to give them some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| If there's something that's really needed, then they can come back, bring it before the board, and we can deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5339)|
| 1:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Just to be clear, I appreciate that, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| I'm not advocating for more specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| I'm actually advocating for more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| And, you know, I think we do have another we're going to be going through this process again before too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| So hopefully, you know, you guys can educate us a little bit more on what the current program standards are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| and if there are any recommendations for any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| or if there just need to be some additions that just specify that you look at flexible items such as ELL populations or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5381)|
| 1:29:53| So I think the flexibility is important, and we can accomplish both things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| And I agree with Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| We definitely don't need a blank sheet of paper at a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| I think that would be asking for big trouble, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| Just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| Since some people are new and even of the people that are here, some of you have not gone through building a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5414)|
| 1:30:25| Maybe sometime after the first of the year that Doug and Russ maybe could schedule an hour and just anybody that wants to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5425)|
| 1:30:41| And this is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Would that think you all could work that in your schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| We may need more than an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| Well, you start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| You start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| We'll talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| It was just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Yeah, that's a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I think the more information we have before we have to make decisions, the better off we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| So that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| And thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Thank you to Ms. Thompson and the principal and for both of you for answering all of our questions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| I think that hopefully that's given us the information that we need to make decisions for Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| Okay, and that is the last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| So I will turn to Ms. Babb for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| I would like to call Mr. Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5484)|
| 1:31:34| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| Can you hear me all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| I'd like to speak about item 13-D, the human resources diversity and advancement position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Knox County Schools has far too few minority teachers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| We definitely need to give minority hiring and advancement more attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| On the other hand, this proposed hire points to a serious problem this board needs to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| By my count, this is the fourth unbudgeted item the administration has brought to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| but there's still no overall plan for spending available monies that were not in the May budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| May 27 budget made massive and damaging cuts to the staff's budget request because of extremely poor revenue projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| Of course, the first thing we remember is the about $17 million in well-deserved pay increases for bus drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| instructional staff, security officers, custodians, administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Our people still need these increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| It's harder to remember other, perhaps more damaging cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| Curriculum and instruction requested almost a million dollar increase, but suffered a reduction of about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| Student supports requested a half a million increase, but suffered about a $200,000 reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Mr. Myers identified the needs for nurses, teachers, assistants for special education at a cost of about $1.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| None of those needs were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| The staff said they needed about $1.5 million for social workers and counselors and some other support staff to meet the needs of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| Those needs weren't met either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| The important thing about these particular items is they were aimed directly at meeting our children's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| Together they come to about $5 million, by my count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| $5 million is a lot of money, but Mr. McPherson reported in September that KCS had almost $10 million available in the fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| above and beyond the state-required $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| Tax revenue continues to come in above last year's revenue, far more than projections the budget is based on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5628)|
| 1:33:57| We have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| The question is how will we spend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Let's look at what's happening in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Mr. Reiswick reports that students' absentees are the highest ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| He reports that more students than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Mr. Thomas made reference to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Our failing classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| These are powerful indicators that our students, many of our students, are in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| Almost certainly our students' needs for counselors, social workers, is even greater than the staff anticipated in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5657)|
| 1:34:25| Teachers are also in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| They are overloaded, overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Many of them are close to the breaking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| They need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| I don't have any doubt that we need this new administrator, and I believe the central office is understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| That's all clear enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| What's not clear is how an additional administrator or other additional administrators are going to help the students and school staff who are in crisis right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5683)|
| 1:34:53| I hope we can afford both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| I think you will agree that the needs of our children and our staff in the schools must be the highest priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| I urge you to tell the superintendent to postpone this staffing request, and he has a plan to meet the needs of our students, their teachers, and the other staff in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5704)|
| 1:35:16| If there's still money after those needs are met, no doubt diversity and advancement position should be the first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5716)|
| 1:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Ms. Tanya Coates, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5726)|
| 1:35:33| Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| President of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| I want to thank you all, Madam Chair and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| I want to particularly talk to you about two line items under your regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| One is about the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| I know that you didn't have any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| For one, I want to talk to you in regards as you consider next week when you're getting ready to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| Why it's so considerably important that it's coming from the board and it was recommended by the superintendent, which I can't say enough that he's done everything to support the educators of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5758)|
| 1:36:15| But when you think about this resolution and it's your beliefs, educators across Knox County really honestly now know that you support them by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5775)|
| 1:36:27| Majority of you up here have actually went through a plan or you've actually started a new job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| Well, this is what most educators feel like this year, that they are doing double the amount of work, sometimes triple the amount of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5794)|
| 1:36:43| It's just that our hands are tied as educators in the classroom when it comes to this, making sure that students value their test scores are added to our evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5803)|
| 1:36:56| This year, this is unprecedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| We shouldn't even be evaluating educators this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| We shouldn't even be testing kids this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| And I know you're probably sitting there telling yourselves, I know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| But I think through our legislative, through your legislative plan, you need to make some concerted efforts or at least consider some concerted efforts of really, truly understanding what educators are going through in their classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5832)|
| 1:37:27| If you have to think about teachers are learning this year on a hybrid level, a new technology piece that we just got back at the end of July that all of the educators in Knox County just got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5847)|
| 1:37:44| And we had to learn Canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| We had to learn new Aspen, but they don't even talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| So it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| And I think it's unfortunate that our State Department of Ed has no idea what educators are going through in their classrooms to try to make sure that students are learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5872)|
| 1:38:06| So we appreciate the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| But I think more concerted efforts, not only in your districts, but across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| We need to join together to show that educators don't need this pressure of being evaluated for one and students being tested and wasting valuable time and money where we need to be uplifting and mentally supporting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5895)|
| 1:38:31| The other one that as you consider the collaborative conferencing management team, we are overwhelmed with gratitude to know that you have the confidence to actually name a management team before a vote is even completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5911)|
| 1:38:51| This is showing that our collaboration with your educators in Knox County and with the board working together to make sure that one, we're addressing the seven things that the state says mandated before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5931)|
| 1:39:06| That is that you are always wanting to make sure that you're improving the salaries of employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| That you're making sure that we have a viable grievance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Our insurance that you just agreed to actually pay for for us last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| Fringe benefits, working conditions, leave and payroll deductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| Without your consideration and having a management team already assigned before December 1, it would have been evident that you did not support educators in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5966)|
| 1:39:38| But you have two valuable things that are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| Would you consider next week that are the most valued thing that you could do for your educators in Knox County is agree to assign a management team and write this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5981)|
| 1:39:52| And we can't say thank you enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| I'd like to thank our public forum speakers tonight for coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| And do we have anyone who would like to comment during the board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| I just kind of wanted to say that this agenda that we have this meeting gave me a little bit of encouragement that we're getting back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6014)|
| 1:40:23| So with the Grow Your Own program and adding the position, just kind of thinking about us getting back on track to moving Knox County schools forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6023)|
| 1:40:30| And it also gives me I know we're still in the middle of a pandemic, but it feels that like that feels a little bit more under control and manageable to where we're now focusing on moving the district forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6030)|
| 1:40:42| So thank you for putting this stuff back onto the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| And then also, I just want to express gratitude to the Linesville community for advocating for what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| And also just my fellow board members for being as concerned as I am with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| Ms. Coates, collaborative conferencing has come a long, long way since we first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| And it's greatly appreciated all the work that went into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| I'd like to remind people that the Teacher Supply Depot opening is this Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| It will be a little bit different this year to ensure plenty of room for distancing and other safety measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| So teachers, please be sure to look at your email from Carly or check the Teacher Supply Depot's Facebook page for a link to sign up for a shopping time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6085)|
| 1:41:34| I believe the ones on Friday are filled, but there are shopping times available on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| So be sure and look at the Facebook page or email from Carly to get the link to sign up for Teacher Supply Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6100)|
| 1:41:48| And also, big thanks to all the folks who've been putting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| There have been tons of donations coming in, and the staff has been working very, very hard, and volunteers working really hard to get that set up and ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6111)|
| 1:42:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Okay. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| I think I'm going to propose next week that we just add a conversation to discuss the quarantine, the amount of time our healthy students are being quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6128)|
| 1:42:19| I know you've probably heard from community members, as I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| I think if there's data that we have that could be shared with board members about the number of students who've been quarantined who actually become sick, that could be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6144)|
| 1:42:35| So if we have that to send out to board members, when you look at the amount of failing grades that we know that our virtual students have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6155)|
| 1:42:44| and then you think about students who move from in-school to virtual and the disruption that that is and how detrimental that is to student grades and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6164)|
| 1:42:58| I think as we learn more with COVID-19, I think we need to make sure that we're adjusting to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6178)|
| 1:43:06| Obviously, it would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Anyway, we can talk about it next week, but if everybody would just go ahead and kind of gather your thoughts, and we can discuss that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6188)|
| 1:43:18| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Since you brought it up and we're going to talk about it, I would like for you to think about consistency as far as what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6199)|
| 1:43:29| You remember at the retreat, the health department doctor told us that if somebody tested positive, no matter how many people were in the room, they should all be quarantined, I think, until they could run that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6209)|
| 1:43:55| I don't think it's everybody in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| If a student in a classroom were quarantined, then the whole classroom would be quarantined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| That's what she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| I've had that conversation several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| Well, how do you decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| How do you decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Well, it's up to the staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| So, Dr. Reiser, would you like to address that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| Because I think that this is kind of important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| This is not on the agenda, but this will just provide us some clarification as we move forward for next week's conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| And Mr. Myers couldn't be here tonight, but he knows this far better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| But basically, the contact tracing, our nurses were trained by the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| I would say they're kind of deputized by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| So, they follow those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| And if there's any kinds of questions or unusual things from the training that they received in a situation they encounter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| they always go back to the epidemiologist at the health department to get clarity or that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| So, it's basically the CDC guidelines of the 6 feet or 15 minutes of exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| So, we have lots of, let me say it another way, we actually have not as many as we expected to have in classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| where sometimes that's happening around quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| And so, lots of times it's the tracing process of the interview of the person who tests positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6312)|
| 1:45:20| as well as we've had everything from talking to the teachers in the room and or other adults, interviewing students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| and even at times looking at kind of tape and videotaping that sort of thing from if they were on a bus or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| So, all of that goes into each one of the traces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| And, again, they were trained by the health department to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| Well, I don't want to belabor the point, but the parent did tell me that one kid tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6339)|
| 1:45:50| and this was in high school, tested positive in the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| I don't know exactly how many kids were in there, probably 20 or more at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6355)|
| 1:46:04| And that his daughter was sent home for two weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6364)|
| 1:46:16| And some of the other kids were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| They were all in the same classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And they made her do the full two weeks, and she told her dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6386)|
| 1:46:44| and I think she probably told the truth because I think they're truthful people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| that the person that tested positive, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| I have never been within 30 feet of the guy in my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6416)|
| 1:47:04| So why would they send her home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Now, that might be an isolated situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| but if they're splitting the class, sending some, some, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6433)|
| 1:47:21| And I'll just say this again, and there are details in every situation that are part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| but sometimes it's the 24-hour exposure of over 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| So, in some cases, you could have a student who might have been in two classes with a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| and maybe had that extended exposure as opposed to one class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| So, again, I don't know without knowing the details of that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| So, just for my purposes, what I said there is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| They're operating now with the 15-minute rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| Six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| Six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| And six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| And that changed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| The 15-minute thing changed about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| So it's cumulative and not consecutive 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| So that's a big difference also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Well, but when we had the retreat, she did tell us that, though, originally, didn't she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6489)|
| 1:48:18| That they would send everybody home until they could investigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I'm not 100% sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| That doesn't matter now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Anyway, I didn't want belabor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| So we'll just, if you would, gather your thoughts on that, and we'll come back to that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| And if there's no other board quorum, then we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-201104?start=6521)|
