| 0:03:08| Clerk, if you'll read that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=188)|

| 0:03:14| for failure to pay the $100 privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=194)|

| 0:04:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Have you paid the $100 privilege tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| No, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Why haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| We didn't receive any notice, and the second notice they sent out was returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| It wasn't signed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| The mail goes to a community box where there's apartments and a restaurant and a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=259)|
| 0:04:27| Is your address 5700 Old Rutledge Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| That's the address of the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| I mean, do you have a different mailing address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| The home address is where all of our other mail goes to where I made sure I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| And they said this had to go to the bar, it couldn't go to the home address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| When I called and asked about it, whenever we got the notice on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Yeah, the notice went to the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Are you prepared to pay the $100 privilege tax today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| You don't want to present that check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| You don't want her to go ahead and present the check to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| How about going next door and to the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and paying the $100 tax and come back and show us your receipt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| I'm going to hold off on that item for about 15 minutes to allow you time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Item number 5B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| 5B is for Humphammers Market and Deli at 7331 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Jerry L. Neely is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| Are you Mr. Neely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| And you have now paid your $100 privilege tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| I talked to the clerk's office last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| We had this same lapse in when my business taxes due and payable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| and when this permit is what I'm supposed to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| I was under the understanding that it had to be the same this year's tax paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| which they didn't mail me back to a 303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Well, they issued it on 303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| I got it 310 last Monday, Monday a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| And then paid it whenever I got it, Thursday or Friday of that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| But now I understand I can use the previous year's paid business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| I thought it had to be your current one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| That's why I was trying to explain to you last year, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| We have had a recurring problem with Humphammers Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| I remember seeing it here last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| See, somebody had told me that it had to be a current, my current business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| And I don't get it until the end of February or March because it's not due until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| I have it right here where I paid it on time and it says they issued it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| typed this up on March the 3rd after the copy of it was done, supposed to be back up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| But now I understand I can use last year's for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| The confusion may be that you're talking about a business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| and we're talking about a privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| And for the privilege tax, I have to send a copy of my, and the way I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| a current, the current year business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| See?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| And I wasn't getting it until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| But now they've told me, the clerk's office has told me I can use, since I have that lapse in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| I can use the one from the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| And that won't be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Last year I paid $100 and donated $100 to the underage drinking problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| I'm not trying to get out of paying the $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| They were just asking me for the impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Well, we've sold out well over 100 of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| We only had three that haven't paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| And you're one of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| And so here you are again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Maybe we've got it cured for next year, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Well, now that somebody told me I could use the previous year's business tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| if they want me to use the current one, I can't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| Nobody can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Because you don't have it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Use what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| All right, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| I've talked to Mr. Neely and the problem is his business tax arrives about the same time this notice does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| He understands the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| He had a misinterpretation of those for the last couple of years and this year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| So he's clear now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Clear as a bell on what his requirements are next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Thank you for coming in and paying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Mr. Humpheimer, do you use a computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| You or your wife use computers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| You may just want to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| I know you've got awful good hot dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| My wife does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Well, maybe next year she'll sort of give herself a little tickler as a reminder to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Now that I know I can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| See, I've been, it's not us forgetting, and you all mailed me a notice, but I haven't had a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| But now I understand I can use the one from the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| So, like, next year I've done got a copy of it for you right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| I mean, I know you're good for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| I'm not worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| You can come downtown and take your time away from your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Do I hear a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Don't need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Don't need one for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| No action necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Five C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Five C is for you and me at 2601 East Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Linda Jane Fosard and Martha Acosta are the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| Linda Fosard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I live in Rutledge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| I am a partnership with Martha Acosta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| I did not receive the first notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| This being my first time voting a business, just assumed that this $100 would be due at that same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| like last year when I first got it in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| I misinterpreted that it had to be at the first of each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| The signed paper that I received came in the middle of a very busy lunch time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| A friend of mine actually signed for it, put it aside, forgot to tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| That's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I am also in the midst of trying to dissolve this partnership, which is going to have to happen in a courtroom here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| and thought that I'd be reapplying for one of my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| I am ready to pay this today and would have it any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| Didn't know I could do it before I came here today or I'd went there first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| I can run over there and pay it, come bring you the receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Why don't you go over and do that right away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Walk as fast as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| We'll probably be here for 15 minutes, so we won't have to act on this today, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Well, you don't have to wait another month, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| So we'll suspend A and C and look at those in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| This is an application for Super Mandarin at 7212 Maynardville Highway for on-premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| formerly Mandarin Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| And we've received a letter from the establishment indicating the ownership's name should be Super Mandarin Restaurant, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=666)|
| 0:11:23| Okay, sir, you want to come to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Is this the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| There's nobody here, are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| Anyone here for Super Mandarin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=692)|
| 0:11:43| Super Mandarin Restaurant, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| You want to move it to the back of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| Move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| 6B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Item number 6B is an application for Thomas Joseph Pitner at MTM's 7712 Clinton Highway, on-premises, formerly Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=719)|
| 0:12:10| Yes, sir, that's about me, Thomas Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Okay, Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| You were here last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| Right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| So you're here asking for an on-premise beer permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Is Raymond's place currently in operation right now or MTM's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| MTM's is in operation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| And do you allow nude dancing at MTM's right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| So that's not taking place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| That's right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| And you understand that that can't take place as long as you have alcohol on the premises, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| And you explained it to me the last time, if we were to have any entertainment like that on our venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| we could not serve beer or even have it on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| That's why we weighed our options and we would rather have the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| We think we could generate more revenue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| I just want to get you on the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| I have some questioning that I'm required to go through, and let's just start through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Has beer been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| I believe they have sold it there for probably about 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| No outstanding license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| This is an application for on-premise consumption only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Do you own the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Lease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| You lease it from who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| HP Oxidine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| HP Oxidine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| And they're in Knoxville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Who makes up HP Oxidine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| Who is HP Oxidine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Who are the persons that are involved in HP Oxidine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| That's his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| That's the initials of his first name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| So he owns the establishment, the premises itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=853)|

| 0:14:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Are you going to be the person operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Yes, I'm sole proprietor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Does anyone else have an interest in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Business license is in my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| I take care of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=875)|

| 0:14:38| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| It was called Top Chef.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I believe Kim there sitting next to you looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And it is, you know, the Sheriff's Department does accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| I need some reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=892)|

| 0:14:55| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Beer Board Inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| I believe that he just answered my application don't have a general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| You're going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| I'll be the general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Codes, send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| And this checks out with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=918)|

| 0:15:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Mr. Pitner, Commissioner Lambert and I both are representing the district that your establishment is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| And I'm glad to see that the featured attraction there is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| And we certainly hope that you're successful and that you do as you have told this board today that you will going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=940)|
| 0:15:49| We thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| We have heard the place has had a bad reputation in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| and we want to improve that and not let it be an eyesore on the community of Knoxville and the Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| Well, we would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| We have two people I believe who want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| And so if you'd like to come on down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| State your name and address for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| When I previously owned the business, it was Donna Sproul's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| It's Donna Rainwater, 134 Pembroke Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| I previously owned the establishment from Greg Turner, Raymond's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| It was called, I know you all are familiar with Raymond's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| I have a lawsuit pending against these guys because I had a contract with Greg Turner when he died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:55| He still owed me money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| And I've got a pending lawsuit against them because they stopped us from coming in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| and looking at the equipment that was still in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| And, I mean, we were given a bogus piece of paper from Mark Powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| I think it's one of the guys here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Which are partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Which are partners together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| And Matt Taylor here is a convicted felon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| And so, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| I know he's a convicted felon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| And I just wanted to put my input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| And whatever relevance it has, I just wanted you guys to be aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Sir, do you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| My name is Matt Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| I was in college in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| And my roommates and myself got ourselves mixed up playing around on a computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| and manufactured some counterfeit money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| That was in 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Furthermore, Mr. Turner died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| The state Tennessee Department of Revenue told us to keep everything in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| There's an exorbitant amount of back taxes owed on Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| The rent there was $800 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| They were behind on their rent to the tune of $7,000 just for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| $2,900 for the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| They were evicted and we leased the property for Mr. Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| In the process of this, the State Department of Revenue showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and they said the stuff was not worth getting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| And then I don't understand how the only lawsuit they would even be able to have would be against Mr. Turner's estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| So I don't understand why they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| I don't have any lube around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| The fact is they opened up a club on their own with using the equipment and stuff that was already in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:58| And we weren't allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| I mean, they put an injunction against the guy who was running the place because he had a TV in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| and stopped him from coming and had a warrant for his arrest for a TV and beer that he had already purchased and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| They wanted to keep everything in the business so they could open up a business of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| That's why they give us this paper that gives us three days to get out or pay up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| So what is your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| I'm Curtis Rainwater, 134 Pembroke Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 37830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get our law director to weigh in on this before we go any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| because it sounds like there is litigation here and obviously hard feelings between these two parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| Mr. Law Director, would you weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| The litigation doesn't bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| I want to understand, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| When I previously owned a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Hang on just a minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Sir, your name is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| What is your relationship with Mr. Pitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| What's your agreement with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I don't have an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| I was going to be an employee there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:07| But, I mean, if me being an employee there denies him his beer license, I guess I no longer have a job, just to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| Excuse me, but the MTM stands for Matt, Tommy, and Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Which are these three right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| I wasn't aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| Mr. Pitner wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Matt will come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| I knew the man, Greg Turner, that passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| I'll just tell you how this has taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| Matt Taylor also knew the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| He said, approached me about taking over what was formerly Raymond's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| I had been involved in that sort of nightclub business probably since 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:13| And Matt Turner helped me get in touch with the Oxidines and acquired a lease for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:24| Matt Turner and Mark Powers, they're close friends of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| They helped me put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| That's why the name MTMs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Matt, Tommy, and Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| I'm going to be responsible for all taxes, income, state, county, all licenses, phone bills, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:46| It's all me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| These gentlemen will work for me on salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| But as far as them being owners of the business, I take opinion suggestions from all employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1311)|
| 0:22:01| to make anything that I operate a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| And as far as any equipment or anything that was left in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:11| the Oxidines said we could take it and run with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| We have also bought tables and chairs of our own in the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| And I believe they also had just mentioned about a gentleman having a television set there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| When we required the lease on the place, they were given notice to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:38| It was a bogus thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Ma'am, just let him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Let him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Mr. Powers delivered this to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Then I had to have the locks changed on the door because the people in question that had bought beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| I would say it was from the grocery store for sale instead of from a vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and picked up a television set when our phone number was posted plainly on the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| if you need to gain access to the building, that you could contact us so no one was actually put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| I believe that's all I can say unless Matt would like to add anything that I've forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Go ahead, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| When we went to Mr. Oxidine and talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| that's when we were aware that Greg was in the process of more or less being evicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| but he didn't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I told Mr. Oxidine, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| that it was perfectly legal to inform the tenants who these people are not the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Mr. Turner was the tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Mr. Turner is deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| There was a bunch of squatters, which was not these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| There is no warrant taken out for anybody's arrest for a TV or anything of that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| They were in the building without our permission, so we changed the locks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| I don't know where any of this is coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| but you can call the sheriff's department and ask if there's been a warrant taken out for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| There has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| But basically we had to, I thought it was perfectly legal for us to inform a tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| and there was nobody to inform because Mr. Turner is deceased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| so we posted a notice on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| We had people in the building who were not related to Mr. Turner when we went down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| so Mark just handed the paper to them and it more or less said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| you need to cash the rent up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| There was no existing lease with Mr. Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| There was a month-to-month verbal lease which can be terminated at any time with a 30-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| And that's more or less what they were made aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| that Mr. Oxidine was not going to renew the month-to-month lease with the current tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| We need to stay with what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Mr. Law Director, from what you've heard, what do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| Well, what I'm most concerned with is the fact that Mr. Pitner seems to be of the mind to employ this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:58| And this gentleman, I believe, has, from what I understand, has been convicted of a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| I would believe that involves moral turpitude, certainly within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| Counterfeiting certainly would be one of those crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| It's a matter of trustworthiness and credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| 1997 to 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| And it starts from the date of the conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| Do you have any of, I mean, I don't have a way of checking that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| And, you know, your name's not on and not on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| It's certainly unlawful for Mr. Pitner to employ a person who has been involved in such a crime within the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| What you're telling me is it's 11 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| To my knowledge, I mean, if it's convenient, I'll just, I guess, I work for Sam Keck during the day doing excavating work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| I mean, it's, I work like a night there a week for 60 bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| So, I mean, it's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| If he has to fire me to keep his beer license, that's fine and dandy for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| I mean, I'm just got a little inside knowledge on the two things that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| That's why I came down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| The other gentleman, is this the other gentleman that you're going to employ, Mr. Pitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Sir, would you come to the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Can I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| What's your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Mark Powers, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Sir, have you ever been convicted of any crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Have you ever sold beer before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Ever been involved in an establishment, in an establishment that sells beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| I used to work at the Mouse's here in Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| A long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| DJing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| I mean, they sold beer up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Have you ever worked for Mr. Pitner before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Where was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Last Chance Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Last Chance Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I used to DJ for them down there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| They don't sell beer down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| I mean, they do in a separate business, but I've never been in an establishment that sold beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| but I have had the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Are you part of the ownership of MTM?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| How did MTM get its name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| I mean, however he wants to call it, I guess that's, you know, that would be up to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| whatever he'd like to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| If he would like to do that for, you know, out of friend's sake or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| just call it a happy little place, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| He can name it whatever he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Mr. Pitner, would you come back to the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| We're taking you on your word today that you do not have a partnership with these two gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| Now, that's true, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Everything is me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| I'm a sole proprietorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| You understand that you cannot employ someone, you've already testified to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| but you cannot employ someone who's been involved in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| In the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| And it runs from the date of the conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| So you all can look at that and you can be the judge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| But otherwise, you know, the sheriff's department, I'm sure the sheriff's department is going to check on it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| We had this when we took our alcohol servers training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| And I assume that the time lapse on that for anything would already be past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:32| And that's why we went ahead and I answered the question the way I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Folks, do you all have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Do you all have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| The only other thing that I have to add is when I talked to the Oxendons after Greg died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| they told me that Matt Taylor came and acquired the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| He signed the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| That's what they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I don't know, you know, that's all I have to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| So, I mean, I wish I'd brought the paper with me and I didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:12| When you say brought the paper with you, what would you bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| What are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| It's a bogus piece of paper that they got off of the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| Matt Taylor showed up at the establishment with claiming to be a person of the law to stop people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| to stop us from coming in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| And I can bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I'll go back and I'll bring it back here tomorrow if I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| I wish I'd brought it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| But it's a bogus piece of paper off the Internet that they just came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| And he, Matt Taylor, went to Eva Oxendon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| I talked to her in length about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| Eva Oxendon told me, he said, he came here and said, I'm going to give you $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| You give me, put the lease in my name, you know, and yada, yada, yada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| And then all of a sudden it was like, you know, we didn't, we couldn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| Couldn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Have you ever seen a copy of the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| The new lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| No, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| It was just going on Eva's, HB's wife's thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| She was so upset and distraught about it that, you know, all I could do was talk to her on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| And another thing is that their lease, from what we were told, we haven't seen the lease itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| It didn't take effect until February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| And all this, the bogus paper and all the, you know, the arrest warrant for somebody getting a TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| which was taken because Matt Taylor went down there to sign it and they didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| But anyway, that all took effect two weeks before their lease was supposed to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| Sir, do you have, Mr. Pitner, do you have a copy of your lease with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| I have one with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| I was aware that there was no lease with Greg Turner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Greg bought it from them in 1999 or 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Once again, I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| I have the floor, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Once again, I'll say that the rent was $7,000 behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| He wanted to evict them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| All Mr. Powers did is there was, they weren't even there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| There was employees of Greg Turner's looting the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Once again, there was no warrant taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| He just walked over and handed them a paper and said, hey, this is a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| You need to catch the rent up or, you know, release the premises so we can get in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| And they just left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| And I've never taken a warrant out on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| But more or less, the Oxendines were tickled to have us or have Tommy, I guess, come in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| And what I did to make me look even worse, I knew that there was no lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I bought the option on a lease from Mr. Oxendine and sold it to Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| You know, I took advantage of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to make a motion that we postpone this for until our next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| to give the law director a chance to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| If you would send your information, the papers that you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and also if the sheriff's department would look into this and let us know the relationship between these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| So, and I know he's offered to resign and so forth, and I think that's admirable that you would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| But I'm just going to ask if the sheriff's department would look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| And so my motion would be that we postpone this 30 days so that we can look into this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I just had a question for Matt there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| What county and state was your conviction in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| It was here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| And I'd also like to say that, oh, I just forgot what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| But let me just sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm kind of, I just, you know, I capitalized on, I guess, Greg not being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| and his family left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Their only lawsuit would be with the Greg's estate on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| I don't understand why they're down here and what they have with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| The Tennessee State Department of Revenue is actually looking for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| And also, that's what I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| If they're, I'm not taking the police report on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| Is that perjury on their part for, you know, saying I'm doing all this stuff that I haven't done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| When the sheriff's department investigates and finds this out, am I going to be exonerated of all these accusations by them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| You'll have to talk to somebody about that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| There's been a motion to second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| I just checked with the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| This fellow right here on the end is a sole owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| No partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. Pitner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Mr. Pitner, if this motion passes, what I'll need from you is a copy of your lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| And I'd also like to see a copy of the agreement that Matt just mentioned where he bought the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and sold the option to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| I got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Do you have, Mr. Pitner, is that his name, Pitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| When did you want to start your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| We've actually been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| We've been open there since sometime in February is what our tax that I've been able to have sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:15| and keep up stuff for sales tax and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| So February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| Have you been selling beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| We sell snacks, soft drinks, have pool table, touch machines on the bar top games, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| That's what we're generating our revenue from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| And it's pretty tough paying the rent and the lot bill when you need some beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| I'd like to have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| That we pass this pending, him getting everything in to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| And being checked out by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| And checked out by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| There's been a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| You got a third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I just called the sheriff to basically ask the reputation of these gentlemen when I found out that they had ran a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| previous club in Knox County on the last chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| And he said they ran a very, very clean operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| And from living in that neighborhood, I know that it hasn't necessarily been the cleanest operation in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| And it just looks like a lot of this other stuff is something for civil courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| And, I mean, they may be right, they may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| but it just looks like to me these are matters to be resolved in a civil court proceeding rather than denying someone a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:52| But the sheriff said that if it would help, that if you'd like to hear from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| he is close by and can come and address that these other folks have had a clean, relatively problem-free environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| at their other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Commissioner Lambert, we have a substitute motion on the floor which will cut the time if they can get everything in in a day or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| I can agree with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| If they will report back to us at our next meeting, let us know that everything is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Mr. Chairman, could you repeat the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| That we go ahead and approve the permit that everything gets in from the correct departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:37| and the law director is satisfied with the lease agreements and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| They're going to provide me with documentation regarding their business to become somewhat assured that their arrangement is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| as they have testified, the sheriff's department is going to do a background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| and then I'll bring that back to you next month just for the informational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| All in favor of the substitute motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Mr. Taylor, Matt, I want to thank you for your honesty that you've given us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| Mr. Pitner, I'm sorry I had to run through another month here, but I think we'll be in good shape here real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| Get me your information, you know, as soon as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2242)|

| 0:37:24| 6C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| 6C is Mexico Lindo Restaurant at 462 North Cedar Bluff Road, on premises formerly Taco Fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:36| I just pick up on speed dial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| That's handy, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| I just pick up on things like what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Marlene Rodriguez, 462 North Cedar Bluff Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| All right, ma'am, I need to go through a litany of questions for you, for you to respond to, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| Have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| Not that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| So you are Marlene Rodriguez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Pedro, is it Reyes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Pedro Reyes is one of the co-owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| We're three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| And Alejandro Lopez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| It's another owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| And you believe that those persons also have not been convicted of any crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| No, they have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Has beer ever been sold here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| I am not 100 percent sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| When Pedro and Alejandro bought the business, I was not on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| So I cannot tell you for sure that in the previous business that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| We don't show that it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| So there's no outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| This is for an on-consumption permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| On-premise, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| On-premise, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| And you don't own the premises, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| No, Pfizer Incorporation, which is under Bagley, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| That's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Bagley Land Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Bagley Land Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| That's their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Who is it that owns Bagley Land Company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Pfizer Inc. is the owner and Bagley runs the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| That's what I think that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| So you're one of the three people who are going to operate this business, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| And is there anyone else that has an interest in the business other than you and the two others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Ms. Rodriguez, are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations and do you agree to conduct this business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| I am not familiar with the law and the rules, but I am willing to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| You're going to have to learn before we grant you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| It would have been in the, has she gotten the package already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| So whenever, did you file the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Yes, I did, but because we had, there is something with the fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| and there's something that Pfizer Inc. has to do about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| so I wasn't sure that I was told to come anyway even if certain things were not in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| You're going to have to read all the information that's in the packet and make yourself familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| As well as you're going to need to complete a server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Have you done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| In addition to that, Mr. Beer Inspector, is this the one that needs a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2453)|
| 0:41:03| Mr. Law Director, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Beer is sold within two feet of it right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Because they received a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| That lesson was issued back when Chief Wagner was fire marshal, and he said shopping centers, he didn't require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Obviously, we need to defer this one for a month so you can familiarize yourself with the beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| and complete a server training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| And let me get some reports right quick and see where we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| We're pending on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| We have absolutely nothing to do with the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| That would be out of codes, Kim Mayler zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| We wouldn't have addressed that in the past at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| We have a letter from codes, and it's pending with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| Health department, do you have any issues with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| It's pending upon the regulations of the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Beer board inspector, do you have any other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| I've told her she would have to be certified and all the employees have 30 days, so she's willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| All three check out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| I think this is one we ought to defer for 30 days and give her more time to do what it is she needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| In addition to that, we need to look and see if you need a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| If you do, you'll need to go before the board of zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| I'm not familiar with that word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| It means you wouldn't be zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| You're too close to a zone that doesn't allow sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I understand from talking to the beer inspector that this is right next to a location that already sells beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| But our ordinance has changed over the years, and for any new location, you would need to comply with our ordinance as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| So you may need to be an exception to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| And so you'll have to come before a different body, the board of zoning appeals, in order to get the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| How do I find out about that if I'm supposed to be selling or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Come and see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| And we need to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| So let me give you my number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| I don't have a pen if I can borrow some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| 215-2327.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| So just identify yourself as Ms. Rodriguez, and I'll get together with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| and we'll see how many feet you are and what zone you're in and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| I was just alerted to it today that you may be out of compliance with our zoning regulations, so we'll look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| Well, it's actually better if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| We'll get codes involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| I'll make the motion we postpone it until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2664)|

| 0:44:44| I'm Gary Jones, 136th Oak View Drive, Kingston, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| I'm the general manager down at the Flyin' J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| We had our beer license revoked due to the change of the name that was on the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Our original license had Smokey's Restaurant on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| The restaurant since changed names since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| The restaurant at that time back in 89 must have served alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| I'm not aware of it if they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| That's why their name is on the permit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| But all we have now is off-premises alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| We don't do any on-premises at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| And we were just trying to get the name changed because the restaurant changed on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| In the process of that, we were told we had to go to the codes and get re-inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| We got re-inspected by the fire marshal about three different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| fixed as many things as we could that we had on that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| and called back to get re-inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| And the codes office told us that they come down to do the inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| and that the fire marshal, I guess, reports through the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| And so the codes came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| They inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| It passed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| It was our certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And that's kind of where we're stuck at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| Fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| This thing has been around the track two or three different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| We originally did an inspection on the business back on 4-27 of 04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| That was prior to the beer changeover, beer license changeover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| After he applied to the beer board, we did another inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| On that report, Rick Smith, who did the inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| noted that he needed to comply with the inspection dated 4-2704, which was three, four years previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:42| I was out of town or I was having surgery on my shoulder, and when I came back, I called Mr. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| and I explained to him over the phone that that inspection was not a current inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| that we needed to do an inspection and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| So I came down and did an inspection with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| As of that date, I've never been called for a re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| The permit that he's talking about is an 06 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| It was applied for two years prior to him applying to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| It was an old outstanding permit that nobody had ever called for approval on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| It has absolutely nothing to do with the beer inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| This permit was for carpet and paint at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| It was issued a certificate of occupancy back on 8-3106, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| which was two years prior to his application to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| and had absolutely nothing to do with the application to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| The current inspection that we've given him was 11-1307.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| On that inspection report, it clearly states that it's his obligation to call back for re-inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| once he's got the violations completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| And as of this date, I have never heard from him to do that re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| I have not had any messages on my voicemail, and I haven't talked to him personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| When I did call back, I talked to Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I don't have his last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| He told me that I had to go through the codes board to get that re-inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and they would call them and have them come back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Probably because somebody's given him a permit number of an old outstanding permit that had absolutely nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| with the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| We have two basic teams up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| One is a new construction team that's anything involving permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| The other is an existing facility inspection team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| That's where we go out and do beer board inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Or if we get a complaint, we go deal with complaints, or we do periodic inspections on commercial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| On my report, it tells him to call me to schedule the re-inspection, and he never did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| This last beer board meeting, there was a question brought up where copies of this was made for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| This has absolutely nothing to do with what we do here at the beer board or his existing facility inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| I explained that to several of the commissioners at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| And even after that, he still not called back for another inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| That was a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| I haven't heard from him, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| Mr. Hammond, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| You're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Is it possible that the two of you could meet outside and agree for the inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| and go ahead and get this done today since both of you are here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Would you agree to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| So if you all will do that, then we can maybe take this up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| But I think the first step is for you to get your re-inspection done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| And since you're both here, this is a good opportunity for you to talk directly with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Let's go back to 5A and 5C and see if we can run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:57| 5A is Booze and Tunes at 5700 Old Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=2997)|
| 0:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| I have my receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| Give your name again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Betty, Betty, Booze and Tunes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| Okay, Betty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| I have the receipt that Angie signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| There's still one document she needs me to fax her tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| But she told me to bring it back over and that she had come over and talked to you all to go ahead and issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| And what we'll do, ma'am, right here, is put you back on for next month just to make sure that you have sent the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| that she's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| I'm sure it has something to do with your business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| It was the state sales tax I didn't have with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| You'll need to get that in to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| So, if you've done that, I'll check with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| If you've done that, then we won't put you on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| I told her I'd fax it in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Thank you, Ms. Betty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| 5C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| 5C is you and me at 2601 East Governor Severe, East Governor John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| Ms. Pilsard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Melinda Fossard from you and me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| I have a receipt and everything's paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| You've paid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| And you also have some documents to send back to the office, as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| I have it in my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| The same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| If you'll do that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| I took a turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| I lost five pence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| So, you've already taken care of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Will it still be on the agenda next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| No action need to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3103)|

| 0:51:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Anything else come before the Bureau Board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3111)|

| 0:51:59| Super Mandarin at 7212 Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| Anybody here from Super Mandarin House, Maynardville Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| I don't think they are here, but if you'll look at your map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| We need to go back out there and that's on 70-something Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| If you'll look at that map, that's the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| That's Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| It runs in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| That may be why they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| I didn't know it until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| We'll defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I hear a motion to defer that until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| So moved from Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3167)|

| 0:53:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=3189)|

| 1:06:50| Mr. Chairman, members, we have two matters on the agenda for today that I would request a postponement for 30 days on each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:59| The first one is 12D-07SP, related 12J-07RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:12| The other matter is a zoning appeal. Hold on, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:25| The other one is under zoning appeals. It's the first two items, 6A-06SP and 6H-06RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:40| I would request that they both, I represent the applicant for both instances, would request to be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:51| I'll go along with the Dutchtown. I don't know about the others. If anybody else has an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| But for Dutchtown's in the 5th District and I'll agree with the deferral until next month, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| Do we need to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| I would defer. And if no one else has an objection, I'll go ahead and have a deferral for all four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| We might have some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm asking for a withdrawal of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| It's an appeal by Arthur Seymour, Jr. for Sineco. It's on page 2570450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:41| We have received a certificate of appropriateness from the Tennessee Tech Carter Development Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| so that appeal is moved and I would ask that it be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Withdrawn, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Withdrawn, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| I don't know whether that requires any action or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| We'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Did you have something, Mr. Valiant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Yes, Mr. Chairman. John Valiant, 800 South of Yates Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| I represented Mr. Jim Lord in a matter on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:23| It's IB08SP1T08RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| It's on page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| James Lord and Glenn Goffenheim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I discovered a number of weeks ago that I had a conflict, which in my conflict was Mr. Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:44| I'd been representing him and a client of mine who owned property across the street from this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:52| on one of the other corners called and indicated that he had discussed this with me sometime prior to my undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4192)|
| 1:10:02| This is Mr. Lord's representation and indicated that he did not want me participating in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:11| I had talked to some of the one of the presidents of the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| I think Mr. Dykes is here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| And indicated to him that I did have a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| I sent a letter out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| You'll have to excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| I'm losing my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| But on March the 13th, I had discussed it with everybody before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| I don't think it's fair to have Mr. Lord have to proceed today without the representation of counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| especially when he was relying on counsel to advise him through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| And I would ask that he be given a 30-day postponement in order to obtain a representation of an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:58| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| This is out in our district, and I did receive the letter, as everybody else did, about John Valiant having a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| However, I know I would ask that all the people that have come here today to oppose this, could you please stand at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:18| There's a great number of people who have arrived today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| and I think that maybe the playing field has been leveled because I don't think they have any legal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| So I would like to put a motion on the floor for this to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| I might say that the president of the group knew that I was going to be asking for this weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| And I, in fact, told him, in case you want to advise the people that I'm going to be asking for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| so that they don't show up in case it's postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| I don't think it's in fairness, which I think we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| I don't think it's fair to Mr. Lord to proceed without him having advice of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4316)|
| 1:12:06| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| I don't think we need to have a motion to keep it to be heard because it's already on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| So let's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| What do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| I just wanted it to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| No action and then it stays on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Is the president that he talked to, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Can he verify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| He said he was going to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| My name is Bob Dykes, 7544 Gallion Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| And, yes, sir, Mr. Valiant did call me and told me the situation with his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| And while I recognized and appreciated what he was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| and the circumstances that he and Mr. Lord found themselves in, I didn't necessarily agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| In fact, I did not agree to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| I told him that the situation, the conditions that existed when this went to MPC back in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:06| and it was denied, those conditions haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| The position of the community where we've had a couple of meetings with over 100 people attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| and resolutions passed each time opposing this development and opposing this sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| they passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| None of that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| I just wanted to know if you were in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| I'm not in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| I'm going to make the motion that we postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| We clearly have a case here where legal counsel has a conflict of interest, so they're not pursuing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4417)|
| 1:13:45| And I think we should give the man an opportunity to hire another counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| If this was a stalling tactic, if the neighbors were not informed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| that the attorney was going to pull out because of a conflict, I would say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| there may be some sort of a, this may be just a way to stall it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| But that's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| The man clearly admits that he was informed that the legal counsel was recusing himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| because of a conflict of interest, and I think we should give these folks, this property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| an opportunity to hire himself an attorney that does not have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| The decisions that we make on this commission are as strong as a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| We decide whether folks get to work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| We decide whether we're going to uphold a property owner's right to develop his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| or we decide whether we're going to rule against that property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| and deny him the right to develop his property as he sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| And I think that since the decisions that we make literally have the weight of a civil court system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:59| that we should extend the same consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| If this gentleman is going to, if Mr. Valiant is going to have to recuse himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| then I think we should give them the opportunity to hire counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| And, again, if this was a surprise, if the folks were just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| the neighbors were just finding out about this today, I might be more sympathetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| But they were informed that they were going to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| and I think we need to postpone this and give them an opportunity to hire an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Yes, I just wanted to know, when were you made aware of the conflict of interest, Mr. Valiant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:52| It would probably be, the letter was sent out March 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| My guess is that it was probably a week or so before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| And in the meantime, there were some attempts to try to work out a resolution of the differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:11| between the developer and the homeowners association and some surrounding property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| And I was asked to not do anything until those talks either succeeded or failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| And once it became apparent, and after I talked to Mr. Dykes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| and realized that there was no way that this matter was going to be resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| that's when I sent out the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| And Mr. Lord then was aware of your conflict at least, it's been at least three weeks then, sir, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| I'd say that's probably pretty accurate, two or three weeks, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Whatever, today is what, the 24th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| If this was really of utmost importance to him, I would think that he would find an attorney pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| and try to get them up to speed with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| I mean, he was obviously aware because you made him aware once you became aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| And if that were my case, if my attorney was saying you need to be looking for another attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| I think that I would have brought him in fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| He became aware that I had a conflict prior to that time, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| On the 13th, the same, we were in the process of negotiating with the homeowners or the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| I talked to Mr. Dykes probably twice and some other property owners in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:45| And we were attempting to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| Mr. Lord was formally informed that I couldn't represent him on the same day that I wrote the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:58| I guess I'm just still puzzled as to why he didn't try to seek outside counsel himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| or why he didn't try to have someone else at least participate in the process or be an observer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| just to safeguard himself in case it became formal that you needed to sever that relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| Well, I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Mr. Lord is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| But it's not all as easy to get somebody to come in on that quick notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| I mean, I'm fairly certain that if somebody came to me a week or ten days before a hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| before a county commission and asked me to represent them at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I'd have some concern about whether or not I would want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| You can't find out about the merits or the problems with a particular request for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:55| unless you've been in it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| You can't do it in a matter of a few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| And I understand what you're saying, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| What I'm saying is I would be leaning more to have it deferred if there was a new attorney here saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| I am currently representing Mr. Lord and need time to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| But he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Well, either way, he's only asking for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| And the property, during the 30 days, nothing's happening to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| You said Mr. Lord is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| Is Mr. Glaufenhein here as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| Neither one of them are here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Mr. Lord is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Oh, Mr. Lord, I'd like to hear from you since you're the developer or do you own the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| I'm the developer, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Can you tell us your situation here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Mr. Valiant had said that he had done most of the work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| Have you been involved with him through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| Are you familiar with the nuances of the zoning and questions that may be asked today and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| I met with the individual who asserts a conflict, okay, is the owner of the ground on the corner opposite of my corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:15| When I say opposite, I mean on the same side of John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| That would be the southeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Two days before I received the letter from Mr. Valiant that he was going to have to recuse himself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| I was told by that individual that he was going to support me provided that I do A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| So I was very much surprised when Mr. Valiant informed me that he would have to recuse himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| Let me explain exactly who these individuals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| One owns the ground under the convenient market and the other owns the convenient sale, the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:55| Both of them met with me and said that provided that I do A, B, and C, that they were supportive of my development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| and therefore I assumed that we had worked out the conflict of interest situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| Then I got the letter from Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Last Thursday, I believe, I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| So that's a week since I was informed that no, Mr. Valiant would have to recuse himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| I thought we had worked it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| And specifically, I don't mind telling you what the reconciliation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| At the Planning Commission meeting, I agreed that under the type of zoning that the staff recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:38| which was denied by the commissioners, okay, 8 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| It was denied by the commissioners 8 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| It was a strong recommendation from the staff to approve the zoning under planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| which requires me to take any plan back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| and that plan would have to have neighborhood input as to how we were going to use the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| That's the strong element of planned commercial is that there is input from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| as to how the commercial site will be used, namely uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| And I had agreed that I would not put a convenient market in my development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| And obviously my neighbors next door who said that they would support me were happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:27| They didn't want another convenient market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| and frankly I don't think another convenient market should be at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| So I thought that we had resolved the conflict of interest issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| and then two days later I got the letter from Mr. Valiant that he would have to recuse himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| Now that's a week ago, a week and a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| I got it on Thursday, not this past Thursday, but the previous Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| So it's not three weeks is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| Have you gotten legal counsel now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| I've talked to legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| But you haven't hired them. You're still talking with them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| If this were to go ahead today, would you be prepared to talk about it today and to present your case today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| Well, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Could you do it yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Of all of the issues that are involved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| The strength of having legal counsel is under the planned commercial zoning requirements, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:24| Under planned commercial, the developer enters into covenants as to how the property will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:32| Now when I say covenants, that's not a deed restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| but it's a covenant under your zoning such that if you were not to bring in those uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| then you would be denied your building permit, therefore you could not continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| So it's necessary to have counsel to prepare those covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| in order that anybody of interest, such as the neighborhood, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| would have an input on what the wording of those covenants would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| And this is my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| I've lived in this neighborhood for 33 years, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| It's not my intention to develop this corner in any way that's not good, smart growth planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| Usage is very important for this corner, and I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| And I'm willing to work with the neighborhood on working out a list of uses that would be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| and how they would be put in there, what sort of building, how they would be buffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| I even have gone so far as to prepare plans through Batson & Himes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| that would show I'm adding two lanes to John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| And I want you to know that on the 15th of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| the state awarded the contract to APAC to three-lane John Sevier Highway from Alcoa to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:54| Done deal. They've got the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Somebody from APAC could be here and confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| So this intersection has an excess of 20,000 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| and the only traffic light between Alcoa Highway and Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| I really think that in time the neighborhood will accept a list of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| which I'm willing to confine my development to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Mr. Chairman, a bank would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Mr. Lord, I'm going to need to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| You might have to present your case a little later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I understand, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Yes, I have a question for the president of the homeowners, if I may, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| Okay, Bob Dykes, I would like to know how long this type of discussion has been going on with the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:45| I would say approximately three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Okay, no, but I mean how long have you known about this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| and how with all the meetings that you've had of opposing it, when did that start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| Back in, what, November, December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| Prior to the MPC being heard on the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| So it's been a topic of discussion in the neighborhood for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I just, I really think that we need to give this gentleman time to get an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| I know he said he could present some of the merits himself today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| but I really think he would be better served with an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| This is the equivalent of what we're having here is a civil court proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| The decision we make will be just as binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| It will be just as strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| I believe that we need to allow this man the opportunity to get himself some adequate defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5197)|
| 1:26:45| And I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| We have one more person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| If Mr. Lambert's motion fails, I would like to move this to the front of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| because you've seen these people stood up, about 90% of them were the audience on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| and I'd like to get them out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| I don't want any of them staying up here with this being the last thing on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| So I would like to move it to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| No objections to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| That will be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| We have a motion on the floor to postpone for 30 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Maybe what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Maybe they can work it out by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| We'll be gone by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| That sounds good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5252)|

| 1:29:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| Go ahead and do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| I'm going to need more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| I'm about gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| We're going to hear the appeal first on page 25, number 2, IBO-8SP and ITO-8RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:41| Appeal by James Lord and Glenn Gothenheim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| Patents of MPC denial of South County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| to C-Commercial and O-Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Property located on the south side of West Governor John Sevier Highway, west side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| West Martin Mill Pike, north side of Dan Rose Road in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| Read the next one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| There is also MPC denial of rezoning from RA Low Density Residential and A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| to CA General Business and OA Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| Well, I already know the applicant and the opposition are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| I'd like to hear from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, as read into the record, you have two requests here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| one for a plan amendment, the other for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| The plan amendment, again, is to change the property from low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| to commercial and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| That request was recommended for denial by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| And then the rezoning to follow suit, that was rezoning from RA Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| and A Agricultural to CA General Business and OA Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| That request, too, was denied by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| The number was a vote of 8-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| The rezoning was a vote of 9-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| The property is located at the intersection of Arterial and Collector Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| It is across the street on the south side for some commercial zoning that is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| and I think was referred to by the applicant as Zone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| On the north side, you do have residential zoning in place as well as a low density residential classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:32| For the record, the Planning Commission staff recommended approval of planned commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| instead of the commercial and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| Recommended the commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| Recommended the commercial and office sector plan designation as requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| but limited to planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| And then on the zoning side, recommended planned commercial zoning for the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| subject to the developer of the property retaining office development on the westernmost 4.31 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:15| which is shown by an attached survey and was their original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| The easternmost side of the property would be allocated for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| Again, apparently from the record in terms of the minutes of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| the Planning Commission looked at the testimony from the applicant as well as the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| and apparently the neighborhood made a compelling argument with regard to keeping this under the present plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| And so, in turn, recommended to deny the requests as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| So both requests were denied for the rezoning as well as the planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5573)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| The opposition or the applicant has five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:11| Who would like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| Mr. Duncan, Mr. Lloyd, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| I know that in the processes that we're all involved in, these decisions are always acrimonious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| but I want to emphasize that I am a neighbor and my intention is to do as good a job as you can do at that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:42| It's up to this commission whether it's going to be used commercially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| or it's going to be used for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| It is the only traffic light on Alcoa, and I'd like to repeat a few other facts to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| Facts have a stubborn way of sticking around irrespective of whether or not somebody is against a project or for a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| And fact number one, the intersection is a major arterial and a minor arterial intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:15| There are over 20,000 cars a day there by DOT's estimate in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| That's a lot of traffic, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| It's the only light between Alcoa and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| It is being three-laned by APAC, and the project will be done by June the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| In fact, they're doing it at night in order to mitigate traffic congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| It's six miles from this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| If you go six miles on Kingston Pike, you get to Paper Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| If you go six miles north or east, you're not even close to being out of urbanization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| Now, I've lived out there for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| I doubt that there are too many people who have lived there longer than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| We're used to it being rural out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| It's not going to stay rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| You're all familiar with the new R&D Park, which is 600 acres being built at the end of Pellissippi Parkway in Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| You're going to see urbanization all the way from Knoxville to Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| and all the way down the old Marable Highway to Alcoa Marable in the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| Smart growth is what it's all about, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| We have at that intersection, and within six miles to ten miles, we have no bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| no dry cleaning depot, no Subway Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| We have no barber beauty salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| In fact, I had my hair cut in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| We have no pharmacy, no medical clinic, no cell phone store, no true value hardware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| There's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| And we travel a lot of miles to go to those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| And smart growth tries to minimize miles traveled not only for gasoline consumption purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| but for pollution purposes as well as convenience, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| The staff strongly recommended this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| And in fact, in the year 2002, when the plan was adopted in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| they had proposed that all four corners be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| And the same neighbors showed up and didn't want that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| It was a privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| But I'd like to quote, I hope I still have a minute to quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| several of the staff and city and county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| pay these guys a lot of money to do a lot of hard thinking about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| So I think that it behooves the elected body to at least pay attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| to the people who are paid to think about these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| not the commissioners of MPC who don't even get paid for reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| the portfolio that they're given before the meeting, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| And I'll quote one person particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| I wish I had ten minutes to quote so much of what was said at that meeting of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| Mr. Mark Donaldson for the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| A good plan is subject to modification as time passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| so we allow people to request plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| As we struggle to work with issues related to sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| we try to adopt smart growth principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| As we try to implement smart growth principles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| they are going to lead us as professional planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| to make recommendations about greater density in some places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| where it makes sense to bring various uses together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| in proximity to housing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| And I also want to quote the gentleman who represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| the neighborhood association, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| with a wise observation at the close of his remarks at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| And that was Mr. Scott Ballard, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| He said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:08| there are a lot of traffic improvements that have been promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| that have not been made, but one of them is in the three-laning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| of John Samir Highway. It's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| He asked for denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Do this thing the proper way and immediately start the sector plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| revising this, meaning the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| If developers and MPC staff believe there needs to be changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| of this magnitude due to growth, it is time to roll up our sleeves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| with the community and sit down and talk it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| I agree with him. He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Mr. Lloyd, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| My point is that the sector plan needs to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| and some decisions made about where you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| what I will call light commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| And the staff is willing to start that process immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| I talked to Ken Pruitt an hour ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| and he said that they're willing to launch into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| and they fully expect the neighborhood to be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| But it would involve the entire sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and some real rational thinking about how property will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| Anyone from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| Mr. Chairman, could I ask a question to Mr. Lloyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| Mr. Lloyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| Why do you believe that MPC, the commissioners, voted this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| when they had a strong recommendation from the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| That night there were three new commissioners sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| I don't know whether they even had an opportunity to read the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| that are given out to the commissioners prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| I know that the issues in this case especially are, you know, detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:04| It takes some study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| You have to really think about the issues that are involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| You'd have to know the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| and what lays relative to the residential activity in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| This is just my opinion, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| but I detected no interest on the part of those new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| in anything other than listening to the people in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| who are very much against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| But it's been my experience that every neighborhood dislikes growth, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| when it's in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| They don't care if it's not in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| So I just simply think that the commissioners didn't study the issues enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| to really make a decision about smart growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| Instead, they just didn't want to hear 50 people stomping up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| because they didn't want it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| You ask me the question, I'm answering it honestly to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| We have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Mr. Commissioner, I had one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| What type of development do you see in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| What type of stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| I can't remember who it was that called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| but I know one of the neighbors had called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| and I think one of their concerns was a liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| or some type of development, you know, something in there of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| See, that's why under the planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| I have to come back to the MPC with my proposed uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| and the neighborhood has some input on whether those are acceptable uses to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| That doesn't mean they get their way, nor does it mean that I get my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| It's still up to a decision of the planning commissioners and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| about how that package of uses will be formulated, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| You ask me, a bank for sure, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| I'm tired of driving 20 miles to make a deposit, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| A second use would be a deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| A third use would be a dry cleaning depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| I would probably build a small commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| I'm willing to finish the back of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| I'm willing to buffer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| I'm willing to do everything needed to make it an exemplary example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| of a small neighborhood center, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| And those are the kinds of uses I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| I'm not talking about a convenient market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| I'm not talking about an indoor storage place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| I'm talking about the very thing you see in a small building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| that has about eight tenants in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| Definitely a barber, beauty salon, very much needed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| I've already had, you know, calls from insurance companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| I've already had calls from one of the cellular phone dealers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| So that's the kind of venues you would find in my center, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| You okay, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Mr. Lord, this property looks like it's very close to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| where the food city, well, it's not food city anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| or I guess it is food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| You know, you've got Knoxville TVA Employees Credit Union Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| You have a new Ruby Tuesdays there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| You have the Chop House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| You have a brand-new Walmart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| There's also Mr. Graham's development of Lowe's right up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| So I find it hard to believe that it would take you 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| that you would have to drive 20 miles to get to a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| but maybe not your particular bank, but I know that there are several over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| And I guess I'm just, there is development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| There is a hair salon in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| because I know my mother-in-law gets her hair cut every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Well, not every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| She gets it fixed quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| But, I mean, there's conveniences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| It's not like you're living out in, you know, somewhere where there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| And so I think that that's not really a fair statement to say that it's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| you're going to have to drive 20 miles to get to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| because there's conveniences out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Well, Commissioner Davis, remember, as an example, using myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| I live three miles from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Okay, so I travel three miles to that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| and six miles over to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| And if you've had that experience, it's not one you really want to repeat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| because at the Chapman Highway intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| there's a great deal of congestion and it happens to be a dangerous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| There are other dangerous areas in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| It's not unique, but that's one of the leading candidates for an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| is there on that hillside between John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| and much of the development such as Walgreens, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| When I travel, I travel nine miles one way or 18 miles round trip, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| Everything that would be at my corner is convenience-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| It's not like a Walgreens or a Lowe's or a Food City, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:09| You know, it truly is convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| And I happen to regard it $4 a gallon and an 18-mile round trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| to go make a deposit in a bank a fairly lengthy trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| So, you know, that's what the staff was arguing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| that we see it all over the city, the metropolitan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| We see the small neighborhood centers and we see the larger regional centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| and in between sometimes you see what are called community centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| which are mid-sized, which is probably what's at Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| that community center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Obviously, Turkey Creek is a regional center and so is Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| Mr. Lloyd, I'm going to have to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| You will get three more minutes rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Are you okay, Commissioner Davis, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| How far away is this from the Graham Shopping Center that's been annexed into the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:11| Six miles to this end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Three and a half miles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Okay, now they've mentioned a possibility of a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| Is there a possibility that you may ask to be annexed into the city to accommodate any of the uses of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:27| No, it would be one of the uses I'd exclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Like I said, under planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I have to come up with a list of uses that's acceptable to the planning commission as well as the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:38| I mean, the planning commission can overrule me, it can overrule the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| but still you have to come to some agreement as to what you're going to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| And as I said in front of the planning commission last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| I would be happy to exclude and go on the record right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| I won't do a convenience store, I won't do a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| Can you go on the record saying that you will not seek to be annexed into the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| I mean, I understand that people don't like it when something gets built close to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| A person buys a house and they expect everything to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| And unfortunately in this world, things do not stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| As the population grows, things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| But one thing that I think a person can expect is that if they buy a piece of property in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| that they remain in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| And that's one thing that we've got to protect residential neighborhoods from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| is if this finger annexation, if the fingers go too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| eventually someday the city is going to come in and try to even everything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| And so before I would be willing to vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| I would need some really strong assurances that there will not be any attempt to join the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:58| I'm putting it on the record right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| I have no intention or desire to be annexed into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6480)|

| 1:48:14| Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentlemen of the commission, my name is Bob Dykes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| I live at 7544 Galleon Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| And with all respect, Mr. Lord, I've lived in that area over 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| so I think I can speak to the issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:28| In fact, I grew up on Dan Rose Lane as a neighbor to one of our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:34| I'm here on behalf of the South Dole Homeowners Association, currently serving as the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| And we're opposed to this zoning and to the sector change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| We support the decision that MPC made back in January, and we would ask that you support that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:56| We're not opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| We're not opposed to growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| We believe that a good development is the right project at the right place at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| This doesn't qualify for any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| January the oh, excuse me, before we go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| I'd like permission to provide some additional information to commissioners, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| And they can hand this out while I'm speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| Would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| January 10, 2008, MPC considered this request for rezoning and the sector plan change and denied both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:32| There are at least 25 letters of opposition that's been sent to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| and those are included in your all's package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| Over 250 concerned citizens have signed petitions against this zoning and sector change request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| And part of the package that you're receiving there is a copy of those petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| Two different meetings of the South Dole Homeowners Association has been held on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| with over 100 people attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Resolutions opposing these changes were passed at each meeting with no opposing votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| The requested zoning cannot be approved without a change to the south sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| And this is not a minor change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| It's a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| It's a significant change that requires that substantially changed conditions have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| And according to the guidelines from the county MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| is introduction of significant new roads or utilities that were not anticipated in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| and make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| That's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| John Sevier was planned to be modified all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| An obvious and significant error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| That's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Changes in government policy such as decisions to concentrate development in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| That's not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| Trends in development population or traffic that warrants reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| That is not the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| So I submit to you that nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| No change to the sector plan is required or necessary or appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| In 2004, a sector plan change was denied on the opposite corner from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:13| And the conditions that existed where that was denied have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:21| In fact, there's 14 parcels of currently zoned commercial property within one mile of either direction of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| And those parcels are not developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| The sector plan is not a five-year plan that expires at the end of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| It's a part of a 15-year development plan that represents the collective vision of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| by the community, and by staff planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| The five-year improvement plan is the near-term vision that will help accomplish the 15-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:55| The 15-year plan, the five-year plan that was produced, approved, and adopted in 2002 is not wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| It's not flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| It's not outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| And it does not need changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| If it needs to be reviewed and revalidated or even revised with the next five-year improvement plan, we're in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:14| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| But let's do it from the big picture perspective, not from the desires of an individual that's just wanting to develop items of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:23| convenience and evidently for their convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| This property is not suitable or appropriate for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| And I think that's what the commissioners at MPC saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| There's been no market study to indicate that any of this is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| There's been no appropriate traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| And there's certainly been no community survey to see if it was even wanted in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| MPC's position on this request is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| They denied both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:54| The community's position on this zoning has not changed, and it will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| Mr. Dykes, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| I would just like very quickly, and I'd like, if we could, to have one resident that is very close to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6782)|
| 1:53:09| just point out the pieces of paper that you have there in addition to the petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| is we have a letter that is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| It's a letter of opposition from every resident on Dan Rose Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| which is a small residential lane that will be greatly impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| And the other item that I want to point out is the maps that shows the 16-inch diameter high-pressure natural gas line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:35| that runs diagonally through this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| And there's also some information about how that has to be dealt with on any type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:45| If I may, I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| You will get a three-minute rebuttal, and he can do it at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| I mean, Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| Look at the wrong light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| We look a lot alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| Same perfume, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Do you get your hair done often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| Same place her mother does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| Mr. Dykes, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| Obviously, the property eventually is going to be developed into something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| What is it that the residents would like to see that developed as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| The sector plan indicates for three of the four corners of that intersection to be low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| We believe that to be an appropriate use that's within the character of the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| and appropriate for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| If the MPC was to go back and work with the communities up and down John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| and, as you said, work with them to take a look at the long-range plan as far as sector plans from the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6891)|
| 1:55:00| what do you think that they would come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Do you think it would still stay low-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| I believe that that would be the desire of the community, not just based on don't change it because it's close to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:14| I think it would be based on there are commercial nodes that already exist at Maryville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6914)|
| 1:55:21| and John Sevier at Chapman Highway and Alcoa Highway, and those are not fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| I think the community is okay with commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| I know we're okay with commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| But, here again, it needs to be smart development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| If there's areas already designated for that with the zoning, with the infrastructure, without the demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| we need to develop those first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| And if over time, if there's more demand that warrants more commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:51| I think the community would be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| Do you know of any areas in that area that are designated to be commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:59| The area down at John Sevier and Maryville Pike where the Senior Citizen Center is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:07| there are parcels there that are currently zoned commercial that are undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| Just over the hill from this property, about a half a mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| is a convenience store that has been there for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| and had several operators there that have not been able to sustain that marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:26| And that's available for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Mr. Lloyd, you have three more minutes for the rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| I think Commissioner Davis' last questions were particularly perspicacious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| in that you do have to have a vision of the future whenever you make these kinds of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:48| And again, I repeat, the times they are are changing out in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:54| And in spite of what my fellow neighbors feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7014)|
| 1:57:03| that is the best location for a small commercial node on the highway between Alcoa and Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:14| It's the only traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| It got put there for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| As I said, there are 25,000 cars a day there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| I thought I'd just quote Michael Brousseau of the planning staff at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| and then I'll sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| This is at the intersection of one major arterial and one minor arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| The basis for any type of approval of commercial is on that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| We feel that it is an appropriate location for a small commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| This is right on the corner under planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| It could be developed with respect to the adjacent residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| where staff, commission, and the public get to weigh in on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| When the sector plan was being updated, and I think he means back in 2002 when it was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| it was readdressed in 2004, as Mr. Dykes pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| And again, it was recommended to be commercial at all four corners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| and the neighbors did not want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| So the planning commission didn't change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| When the sector plan was being updated, staff did propose that because it is a controlled intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7094)|
| 1:58:20| meaning with a traffic light, of arterial streets, it was appropriate for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| During that process, the final sector plan did not project commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| and that was because the neighborhood objected to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| It is five years since then, and generally that is the update time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| My point is that in spite of what my neighbors feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| they just don't want to see, if you will, development in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| And I understand their neighborhood, especially the Dan Rose neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| is right behind this property, but so are every intersection in this metropolitan area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| has a residential behind the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| I mean, it is not like this is something unique happening to this association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| It happens all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| It's been going on since we grew from a village to a metropolitan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:12| And I just don't see, it doesn't make any sense for South Knoxville to retard growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| It's in north, it's in east, and it's west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| It needs to grow into south, and it will grow eventually all the way to Seymour and Alcoa Marable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| Planned, smart growth is what is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| and smart growth would auger every time for the conclusion to use this corner for commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| not for low residential activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| There's not a professional planner in America who would disagree with that statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| that it should be used for neighborhood serving commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Mr. Dykes, you have three minutes if you have someone else that would like to take the three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:58| Just briefly, my name is Scott Ballard, 7744 Trophy Run Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| Mr. Lord read you all the quote from my statements that were made at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| I still stand by those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| I just want to make sure that it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| What we said was we need to roll up our sleeves and go to work with MPC on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| not to go to work on his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| So I want to make sure that's very clear, that he can come back with his proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7219)|
| 2:00:25| and if it suits after the sector plan has been looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| and if it accommodates commercial development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| That is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| So I want to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| The other item I want to bring up is he's saying that the South Delaware Homeowner Association, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| we just oppose everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| We've only opposed three items out of 55 in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| So I don't think we're opposed to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| We've got someone else that likes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| My name is Wilson Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| I live at 7108 Danrose Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| That's the road that's right behind where this development would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| And, again, as I'm an accountant by training, so I understand how the economic system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| And, again, we don't want to begrudge anybody an opportunity to make a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| But we do want to talk about the impact on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| On your packet, the top sheet that is represented there is what I'd like to talk about real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:20| First of all, the sector plan serves as the guidelines that have been established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| and they've worked well in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| The current sector planning zoning did not allow for the development Mr. Lloyd is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:33| It doesn't support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| Those are the rules, and he doesn't want to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| If the MPC staff wants to change those guidelines, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| we can get together with the community, with all the stakeholders in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| and look at those to see what needs to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| Number four on that list, what we're trying to avoid as a community is unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| Because on the one hand, I think Commissioner Lambert asked a question about the finger growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| in terms of getting involved in being part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Again, there are sometimes unintended consequences when you do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| and you don't follow the plan that you laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| If you understand what I mean about an unintended consequence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| I don't want to go into a bunch of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| The community overwhelmingly opposes this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| And again, that's not anything we have against Mr. Lloyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| It's just our opinion that differs from his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| We've not received any information from Mr. Lloyd showing that there's justification to ignore the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:35| There's been nothing to show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Mr. Lloyd at one of the meetings described himself as a risk taker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| He said that's why he's doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| And I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| That's how our economy works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| But if this does not work out, who bears the risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| The residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| I live right across the street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| We'll be looking at another set of vacant buildings and concrete if it doesn't work out like some of the other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7371)|
| 2:03:00| There's no evidence of a needs assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| There's no evidence of a needs assessment being done to show that other than what Mr. Lloyd needs in terms of a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| and somewhere to get his hair cut, I'm not sure that there's been any needs assessment that shows what the community at large needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:18| I will say that the subway, there is a subway on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| It's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| My son's a high school senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| We go down there about once a week before his ballgame to get the subway, and it's about three and a half miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| So there is a subway close to that location there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| Number nine is the bottom line for me is the MPC voted not to approve the sector change plan nor the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:40| So we would ask you to encourage the MPC to go back and do the hard work with the community versus doing an ad hoc change at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| Question for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| As I look at the January 10 minutes, Mr. Donaldson, it looks like you had fairly strong statements in support of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7435)|
| 2:04:06| Did you care to kind of elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| Mr. Lloyd did a pretty good job of quoting me, but essentially this area is in what we call our planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:17| and there is a very strong planning tenant to tie land uses to our transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| This particular intersection is an intersection of a major arterial and a minor arterial with an existing stoplight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:32| The right development in that place could, in fact, reduce vehicle miles traveled by providing neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7472)|
| 2:04:41| services closer to the final users and actually reduce the miles that consumers have to go for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:52| That's a strong measure of travel demand and the impacts of that in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7492)|
| 2:05:03| The suggested and recommended zoning is planned commercial, which requires site plan approval with covenants that are recorded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:14| and a set of uses that is determined after a public hearing, so we feel really good about the type of zoning that was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:25| Mr. Lloyd seems to think that this is the right time based on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| A strong indicator of service and retail development is the average daily traffic by a particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:43| It's a pretty strong number at greater than 20,000 at this particular intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:51| It could, in fact, be the right development at the right place at the right time, as was suggested that it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7551)|
| 2:06:01| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| I made a copy of this, and I don't know if it made it around to all the different commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| but this is what I studied over the weekend from katescopeplanning.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| and this is from the sector plan from the general plan that we have as the planning framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| and since we had several sector plans coming up, I wanted to look at this, and I included the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| so for those of you who have access to your laptops, you could look at this yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| On here, it lists changes of conditions warranting amendment of the land use plan, and you'll see that there's four of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:42| and I don't see traffic reduction on there, so I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| I also wanted to say that I realize isn't the date going to be in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| Is that when we're going to review this from MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| Can someone answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| Is this sector plan going to be up for review in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| South County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| South County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| For this next year, we've got the north county sector plan, which we just kicked off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:13| and then we're also planning to do east county sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| So south is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| It's not on the immediate horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| We got word, I did, it was going to be in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| That's what I thought, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| But it is, even if it was going to be in September, some people were saying that it was going to expire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| but according to this planning process, it seems to me that this sector plan is sort of a work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7650)|
| 2:07:38| It's a 15-year development plan with five-year improvements, and they are a little bit delayed on the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| but I just wanted to make you aware that it says the existing conditions component of this report provides a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| for land use analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| And when they do do the sector plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| it says involving the public in planning process is central to the successful development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| and implementation of a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| And so I just don't think it's right right now to deviate from the plan without a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:12| And I think that we need to play by the rules, and I just wanted to share that with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| Commissioner Horman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| That's Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| I can't see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Not like you and Elaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| First question to Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| Would you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| It just seems like the sector plan amendment process is being bypassed, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7721)|
| 2:08:50| in terms of the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| And so is that a misinterpretation on my part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| There's a difference between a sector plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| which is the opportunity to look at the entire sector plan holistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| and involve the public versus a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| which is a parcel-specific amendment associated with a zoning request usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| So the update, we have generally six county sectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| and six city sectors making up the total general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| We try to visit one of those each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| Sometimes they get delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| So we try to have a six- or a seven-year updating schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:37| So when is the next review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| This year we do, in fact, have the north county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| and the east county sector plan in our work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:45| So but for this sector, when is the next review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| Well, 2002 was the last major update, so 08, 09 would be the regular time to be revisiting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7790)|
| 2:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| I have one question for Mr. Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| The assertion by the homeowners that commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| already zoned commercial land is available and unused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| was that a consideration to you in your efforts to go ahead with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| with your commercial development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| All sites are not created equal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| and this clearly is a whole dimension above any other location on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:40| You can't compare a site that's been for sale down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| It's actually what they're talking about is west of the old Knoxville-Maribor Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| There isn't even an intersection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| The old Knoxville Highway goes underneath John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| You can get up onto it, but it's not an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| There's no traffic light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| The opportunities at this corner, all four corners, not just the corner that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:09| but all four corners is very good, and I have to make that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:16| I think that, you know, I don't know what the argument is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| I guess as long as there was a vacant lot in the metropolitan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| they would argue that I shouldn't be building anything at my intersection, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| Well, somewhere between that preposterous statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| and their statement is reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| I mean, it is clearly superior to anything available on John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| other than at Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| The Alcoa intersection is not a desirable intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Anybody familiar with the area knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| So it's a good area for what I propose to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| And anybody in the planning slash development community would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| So, you know, no, I haven't done a traffic study yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| but I already told this group that I plan to make major road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| And my last plan, I wasn't even going on Dan Rose Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| My new plan, I don't even get on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| It should be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| Good planning would use Dan Rose Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| The 100 feet at the mouth of Dan Rose Lane is all I ever propose to use, okay, for my project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:28| I have now abandoned that, okay, and I'm not even getting on Dan Rose Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7948)|
| 2:12:34| I'm putting two lanes of frontal road all across the front of my development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7954)|
| 2:12:39| And I'm improving the intersection at John Sevier and Martin Mill Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| by adding those two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| You'll be able to go up to the traffic light and make a right-hand turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| and other than a quick stop, you probably won't have any delay in going down south on Martin Mill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| So, and Commissioner, I want to emphasize that it's not been easy to interact with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7976)|
| 2:13:03| I was there at one meeting, and since then, my engineer tried to arrange a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| with the leaders of the association they refused to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| The meeting was to be at the band room of South Doyle High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| and Mr. Gary Norvell, engineer, is here to say he made every attempt to arrange that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| and they wouldn't meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| I called one of their leaders last Sunday and wanted to have an informal meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| I got a call last night at 517 returning my telephone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| So for one entire week, I got no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| Now, I was handed the petition that you all were handed when I walked in this room this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| All those residents live in the Dan Rose subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| They're no different than any group of residents in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| They don't want to see any kind of commercial development next to their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| I mean, it's been going on in front of this body for 50 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| and it's the toughest decisions you guys got to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8038)|
| 2:14:02| But if you went out there and looked at the site, you'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| there is nothing different about this site and every other intersection in Knoxville with a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| So if this doesn't go forward tonight, what are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| Are you going to go back and try to work through the sector plan amendment process, sector review process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:24| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| Well, you're asking me the question, and I want to be forthright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| I also have 45 acres to the west of this that I plan to do in a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:39| I will hold the 11 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| I will continue to petition to try to get it zoned for neighborhood-serving commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:50| My plan that I am prepared to show the neighborhood shows my 45-acre residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8090)|
| 2:14:57| So if you can imagine an 11-acre strip 1,500 feet on John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| I've got the next 2,000 feet and about 1,000 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| It's 45 acres that I will be proposing for a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| And I don't expect the association to have any objection to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| since they want to see it in residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| But the actual 11 acres, 1,500 feet on John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:28| the only appropriate use for it is for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| Even though it's right out in front of their subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| that's exactly the way it is every place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| Mr. Lord, how long has Dan Rose been developed? Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:45| I don't know, but I would say 25, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| In excess of 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| And one point of rebuttal, I'm the president of the Homeowners Association currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| No one has contacted me or any of the other executive steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| for a meeting with Mr. Lord in the last week or even before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| Yes, I would just like to call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| Well, we haven't had a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| Ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| Ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| We'd like to go ahead and make a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| and be in compliance with MPC's assessment of this with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:33| And I also want to remind everybody that and actually I would like to ask our law director for some counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:40| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| You want to confirm the denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| We want to deny as per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| You want to confirm the denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| I want to confirm the denial, but before that, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| isn't there some litigation right now with the Midway Road project when the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| and Knox County Commission deviated from the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| It's been alleged that, you know, there was a deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| Yes, there's litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| That matter is currently in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| And I just wanted to make sure that the new commissioners were aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| So, yes, I would like to go ahead and put that motion forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| You want to repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8248)|

| 2:18:18| Both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8301)|

| 2:19:11| This property is located on the southeast side of George Williams Road, northeast side of I.I.40-140,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8351)|

| 2:19:27| Yes, I'm Richard Lemay, 10816 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, here representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:33| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| I have a question, if I might, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| This is to the MPC, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| There was some discussion about the fact that this density is a little high for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:50| but I think the MPC agreed that since it was a small acreage, they didn't really have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| However, this would not set a precedent for any other land that might be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| There was discussion to that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| Whether it sets a precedent or not is up to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| Well, I would like to go on record as saying this would not set a precedent because we're talking about a small amount of acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| I think everyone is in agreement that this would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| Even Mr. Schoonmaker was there, and I think he agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| I would just like to go on record as saying that if it's brought before us again in this area, this is not a precedent-setting measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:26| Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| I'll make a motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| And I agree with Commissioner Hammond that although we're granting this particular piece of property possibly five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| I don't want that to be construed as a precedent-setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| Next one, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| On the top of page 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| This is a request of Heartland Development for a South County Sector Plan amendment from Agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| Rural, Residential, and SLPA, which is slope protection area, to LDR, low-density residential, and SLPA, slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8461)|

| 2:21:25| The next one is a request of Heartland Development for rezoning from PR planned residential at up to one dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:34| to PR planned residential at up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8494)|

| 2:21:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| We had opposition to this, but I've talked to them since then, and they told me this is all right as long as there's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| It's a little less than one and a half an acre, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| I'm David Harbin at 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| I have a request that we amend this request to 1.47 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| And sewer will be put in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| The developers agreed to bring sewer into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| Now, the only concern I have about this is me and Mr. Freeze were informed that the sector plan thing was going to be reviewed in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:28| I believe Mr. Donaldson said to begin with 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| And then when Mr. Norman asked him again, he said 2008 or 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| So the 2008 would be what we were more or less informed to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| But I'm going to make a recommendation to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| We have a couple of lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Commissioner Harbin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| This is a pretty heavily sloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| How are you adjusting to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| Our previous plan was to basically do drain fields out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| When we got out there, we're not doing any more roads now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| We've decided to bring in sewer into the area and basically stay away from the steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| It will be on the more general area of the site out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| And you reduced it to 1.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| Because the staff recommendation was to deny, but I bet it was based on factors like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| If that's resolved, I'm happier with it, and I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| I went out there to the site with you, and I just wanted to know, what are the lot lines going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| What are the width of the lot lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| Around 75 feet wide right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| Now they're about 100 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| So they'll be about 75 feet wide with sewer coming into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| And I went online and actually, Jolie, could I have your help, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| I went on to the NPC's website and looked at the utilities and septic constraints for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8632)|
| 2:23:59| and I'm going to have this passed out to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| And the area where these 100 acres was purchased, it says it's in the South Knox Chapman Utility District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:14| and there's speckled light green dots all in the area, which indicates it's unsuitable for septic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| which you found out or your client found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| And, you know, I live on and I also live in South Knox area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:30| and we have a line that goes in front of our house, and when the house was sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| the seller had to connect to sewer, and it was very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:41| In fact, the gentleman behind us had to spend about $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| So I'd heard that, you know, that you all were saying that this is a good thing for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| and that you're bringing sewer into this area over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| But I had somebody do some checking for me with Knox Chapman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| and actually when you have that line come to your development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| they actually make that line diameter just based on that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| And if they make that any larger so the area residents can connect to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| they actually have to float some bonds and have to incur some expenses themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| And also wherever that line goes in front of people's properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| those people will have to incur more expenditures per month on their utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| just because they have the option to connect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| even though it could cost them thousands and thousands of dollars to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:32| So I wanted that for all the commissioners to be very aware of those situations about bringing a sewer into an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:40| before you make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:44| Commissioner Payne, could you repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:49| I made a motion to approve this at 1.4-something acre with sewer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| It's true, everybody over there has septic tank trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| And I believe you all were MPC approved one per acre, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| Yeah, well, MPC approved an identical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| Because we have septic tank problems over there, MPC asked them to run sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| And like I said, I had three calls against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| They were all relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8777)|
| 2:26:18| And I called one and he said he had already talked to the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| And if we could hold it to the one and a half acre, which it's a little less than that, that they were for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| And I would like to point out that if you have septic tank problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| and it's a lot cheaper to have this, that's a way to solve your problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:36| If we don't do that, there's just no way to solve your problem out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| And, Buzz, this would take care of the sinkhole problems more or less, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| You know, we need to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| And we'll be taking a look at that when the site plan comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| Can I clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| The motion was 1.47, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:56| 1.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Just to be clear, you are clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:03| Over here, you're clustering in the less sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| Is that what you're doing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080324beerzoningbusinesspart1?start=8833)|
