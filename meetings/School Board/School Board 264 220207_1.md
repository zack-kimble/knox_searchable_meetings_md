| 1:47:25| and maybe you're gonna get to this, Betsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| when you talk about the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6447)|
| 1:47:27| but I guess the other part of that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| would be the framework around questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| during the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| So whether there's going to be a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| that kind of kick off the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| and then it's turned over to questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| So I guess you'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| So anyway, that would be my question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| But otherwise, I would be completely fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| So perhaps we would only vote on the other piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| that would be the public part from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| I would be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| And again, to reiterate, the public part will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| that they already have those criteria questions from TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| and Tammy already knows that the expectation is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| in their 20-minute presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| they're just walking us through each criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| So it's not a stop and have a conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| It's we're scoring as they go through the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| That process behind that is because we do want them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| to come as prepared as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| but I do also understand being able to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| in that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| So we felt that that was a fair approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| If the board should vote to turn this over to Mr. Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| which I'm very comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| I would just ask that you put our name beside a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| So we're assigned a question to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| so it's consistent all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| And we aren't picking which question we want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| We just, you put our names beside them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| and assign them to us, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| I know that sounds picky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| but I think it's the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| I would just suggest that anybody that want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| any board member that wishes to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| would contact Mr. Bolton probably tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| and probably you need to make it as precise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| or short, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| You know, doesn't need to be a long drawn out thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| but just to get an idea of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6572)|
| 1:49:36| and I feel confident that he would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| But actually, what I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| if we're gonna vote on that, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| since we normally don't vote in workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| do we need to take a vote to spin the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| You would vote on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Oh, I thought you were gonna vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| That was just my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| For Wednesday, does somebody need to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| to turn this over to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| so somebody wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| If.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| In response to Ms. Horne's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| I'd like to suggest using the format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| that the League of Women Voters uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| when they have, like, candidate questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| Audience members turn them in on a card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| and then a moderator can look through those cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| and if there are questions that are very similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| they can combine those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| and then that moderator can ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| And so, leading into the what's gonna happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| on the schedule, Board Member Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| would you like to talk about the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| for February 17th and 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| So, I was tasked with coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| with the two days for our candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| and I just wanna thank, I worked very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| with KEF and Ms. Coatney on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| and it was a true partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| It was a lot of work, so thank you, Ms. Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| for all your help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| So, we created this schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| and we wanted to be very mindful, very intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| that it was a meaningful day for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| and for our candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| And so, on the schedule here, we have it broken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| for candidate one, two, and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| And as you can see, we have one-on-one meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| with certain community leaders, as well as foundations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| and some school tours as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| We were very intentional with the school tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| We wanted our candidates to have a feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| that our schools were urban, suburban, rural schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| but we also had to be mindful of the proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| of the schools also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| So, we wanted to make sure that during this day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| as they're driving around, the schools are close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| And then, we have a community leaders' lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| That would be, and this schedule took a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| I mean, this was a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| You can see there's a key down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| and that's where the locations are for these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| That was another thing I had to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| all these folks are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| all these locations are available, so it was a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| So, our community leaders' lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| we were also very intentional with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| who was included in that lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| It will be at the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| The chamber's room is available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| And I can send you the list of participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| And also, these folks have it on hold on their calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| They know we have to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| but they do have it held currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6767)|

| 1:53:37| So, we tried to have a very robust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| group of people at that lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6819)|

| 1:53:56| And then all three of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| all three candidates will meet and do all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| but on a rotating schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| At first, we thought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| do they need to all meet together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| But we thought by having them do one-on-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| with all of these folks, it would be more meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| So, opens it up to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Oh, let's talk about day two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| And we can also talk about the community forum as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| So day two, pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| Breakfast with candidate one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| and then they will do their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| We will break, have lunch with candidate two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| with their presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| and with candidate three, snacks in their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| Make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| I know it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| You have a question for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| Ms. Batts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Yeah, first off, wow, this is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I'm very, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| My question is a personal one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| On the first day, where are we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| do we go to the community lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Board members, do they go to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| So, going back to what Tammy recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| from the beginning, it would be best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| if board members just kind of stay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| where board members are wanting to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| or on that last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| Now, you're free to go where you want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| but just for the sake of the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| to be as open and comfortable as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| that Tammy recommended that we kind of stay out the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| until it's the interview time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| I guess my one, I mean, and I'm really fine with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| The one I would be interested in is the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| I mean, I would really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| I mean, I don't want to ask the question there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| but I'd like to be kind of in the back or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| So, I guess that's where I'm just trying to plan out my day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| and where I should plug myself in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| So, really, as board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| the six o'clock is about the only thing on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| Right, right, correct, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| So, when these candidates meet, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| with the leaders of UT or with KEF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| that is meant to be that candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| with that particular leadership organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| And then, I was planning on coming to the community forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| so I definitely think that we should be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| And so, I guess, let me ask you this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| about the meetings with all of these community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Is it more for the candidates to get a feel for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| Because, obviously, it's not helping us make our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| So, I mean, what's kind of the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| your feeling of intent on meeting with all these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| which I think is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| Yeah, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| Well, yeah, I think the intent behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| is that when they come in to interview on that Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| that they have a real good understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| of Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| because they've met with all these different leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| they've been throughout the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| they've met with students in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| So, when they come before the board on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| they're not just blind, they have insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| No, that helps me a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| And then, on the interview day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| so I'm assuming our interviews broadcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| or video and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Okay. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| And then, what about like the breakfast and lunch period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| That won't be broadcast so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| that's just the time for us to kind of be with the candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| and see how they interact in a less formal setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| I mean, it is public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| so people will be in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| and everything on day two will take place in the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7033)|
| 1:57:17| So, anybody can be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| but the intent is the breakfast, lunch, or snack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| wouldn't necessarily be broadcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| And who do you have leading the community forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| So, in the past, Harley, did you do it before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| We did help with the community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| in terms of gathering the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| and getting all the equipment there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| but we actually had a moderator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| and I believe that was Heather Haley with WVLT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Tammy Cleveland from the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| No, Tammy from Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| I'll ask her and see if she'll do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| Yeah, the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| On that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| Unless you wanted to show up, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Mrs. Henderson, I just want to echo to the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| I mean, just, you know, the phrase herding cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| I mean, I can only imagine what this would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| I actually did love doing things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Well, you can tell you, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Which, you can tell you do, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| And I really, really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| On the community forum piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| I know often, like those League of Women Voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| they often use moderators from TV stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| So there's probably several that have done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| and done that type of moderation before as an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| I want to offer up another, I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| and that is, so I think if we come to the community forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| we are going to get to see how the candidate engages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| with community, which I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| And obviously, we're going to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| to interview them the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| The one other thing that I'm wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| if it might make sense for us to be a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| but not participate in, but actually be present for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| is the community leader lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| And my thought in that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| seeing how these candidates interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| with other leaders in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| because I think that's an important part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| And they can tell me how they do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| in an interview the next day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| but I want to see how they navigate the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| how they engage folks, all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| And again, I wouldn't use that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| as an opportunity to nominate the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| or ask questions or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| But as just a, basically a silent observer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| I don't know, it's just a thought for the board to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Is that a place that we might want to also be present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| Not in any of these individual meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| or school meetings or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| but just in that luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| I mean, yeah, you're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Board members can go wherever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| Well, I don't want to be the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| The only one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Oh, Daniel's rolling up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| You know, I'd rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Well, if it makes you feel better, Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| Mike, we're going to fist bump later, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| You know, I'm just bringing people together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| with my schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Yeah, one other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| I'm assuming we're going to have sort of a tour guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| for each of these people on this date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| and have you figured out who's in charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| Yes, so I have not figured out who is tasked with that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| If a board member would like to do that, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| that could be a good job, to be the tour guide for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| The only problem is, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| and this is where I kind of got with the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| I think the luncheon's not a bad idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| but I almost feel like we shouldn't sit at a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| with the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| because then I think you would almost get a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| with a person over another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| so that's why I don't think school board people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| should be in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Yeah, no, I completely agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| but I do, that is one thing I have to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| is finding somebody tasked to be the tour guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Our security, some of our security department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| also, you might want to check with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| That's a good idea, yeah, that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| Mr. Oaks, maybe you can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7278)|
| 2:01:24| I'm sorry, what am I volunteering for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| Thank you for volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| All right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| That is the latest of the superintendent search update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| We are at the final road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| Again, it's process is, Tammy will be here Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| to give us our final candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| As we talked about, up to five candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| and so she will present that Wednesday for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| so we will have that understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| and then we will have the interview on the 17th and 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| We will have a great weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| and enjoy ourselves for President's Day weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| and we'll come back on February 22nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| and have a special call meeting at five o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| to vote on the candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| and Tammy will give us how we will do that process as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| when she gets here Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| I did want to bring something up real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| So, when we vote on this schedule on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| can we also, I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| if somebody, for instance, happens to get sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| are you guys okay with the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| or let's say President Boyd gets sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| are you okay with him filling in with somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| or us finding somebody, would that be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| Okay, cool, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Just one final question regarding the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| Do you know yet what body of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| we'll receive about each candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| when they're presented to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| Is it, I mean, certainly at least a resume, I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| but do we have any idea what that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| I don't know the answer, but my assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| would be the whole packet that she has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| like the whole applicant packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| because then it becomes public record, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| Ms. Febb. I guess the one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| I have as a follow-up to that is we are voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| to take those three candidates that night, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| I mean, yeah, on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| when she presents the three candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| do we have to vote that we're taking those three candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7395)|
| 2:03:21| Well, this is my only question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| is to get a packet of information about the person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| I mean, it's a lot to digest, and I mean, we might even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| I mean, well, that's what my kind of concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| I mean, I'm hoping that I would be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| with the three, I mean, my assumption is I'm going to be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| with the three people in the first sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| and everything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| but to present us a packet of information about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| to us then vote on them to not have time to digest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| that's where I'm having a little bit of disconnect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| about this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| I did actually have a conversation with Dr. Grissom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| about this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| and she said she will go over all that in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| in their process when she comes to speak Wednesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7442)|
| 2:04:06| so, yeah, and she has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| you know, she anticipates that this question will come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| and she is prepared for that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| You may have answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| You referenced something about five, up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7464)|
| 2:04:32| so does that mean that we can have others added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| at the last minute, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| That's what, so the board voted up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| so we, Tammy might bring us three, she might bring us two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| but the board as a whole added up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| so I don't know what that looks like in this schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| if she presents five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Mr. McMillan, my pretty schedule allows for three candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| That's what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| But the board voted we're up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| That's the reason I asked, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| I want to know what we were going to do with four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7503)|
| 2:05:06| The date, we're on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| Well, Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| And I think when we were talking about it as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| yeah, I think that Betsy took it a little over three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| but I think when that really happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| and we could still get four or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| and I'm not opposed to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| it's when we shortened it down from three days to two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| because of realizing the inconvenience that that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| and the burden it would put on the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| so we narrowed it down to two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| and that kind of led Betsy to do a three-candidate schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| but I, you know, we can be nimble, as we heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| and have great agility and change if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| Yeah, but the board vote was up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| so if there's five candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| we will change this and make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| One final question for Mr. Dupleur here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| If we were to have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| I feel confident that she will bring us very qualified candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7569)|
| 2:06:16| that one of whom we can approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| but if we were to want to add somebody at the last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7581)|
| 2:06:31| the board, what would be the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| Would we have to go with five votes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| to add that individual, or would it take two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| Mr. McMillan, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| It would be a majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| so it would be five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| You know, if somebody wanted to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| say there were three candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| and you all agreed that those were the three candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| you wanted, but somebody wanted to add one or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| then a board member would need to nominate that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| There would need to be a second, and then a vote as normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| Okay, so any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Well, that may be the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| I know that when we met with Ms. Grissom, she...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| I don't want to put words in her mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| but she was pretty adamant about not adding a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| at the last minute because it puts that person at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7650)|
| 2:07:35| Well, it's just not a fair advantage with all the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| because these people have been vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| However many she brings us, three or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| have been vetted by an independent group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| that had no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7668)|
| 2:07:49| You know, like that is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| I don't want to use the word secretive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| but it's very private as they go through these nominations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| and she was pretty adamant about the unfairness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| of just throwing a candidate in at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| that did not have to go through that same screening process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| So I'm not saying we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| I'm just saying you have to consider the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| that that is kind of unfair to the other three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| that rose to the top, or five that rose to the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| that were screened by an independent group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| I was thinking we had voted on that, but I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| I believe we did vote that any board member could add someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| who applied that right, Mr. Duggan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Yes, you all voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| I mean, so if you choose another finalist other than the three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| then that person would have to be a candidate that applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| Now I think, and I don't know for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| but I think what Ms. Grissom's talking about is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| somebody may not have went all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| through the vetting process as a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| So she can certainly explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| But I mean, as far as this board's concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| that person would have to be an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7760)|
| 2:09:21| Okay. So are we all good on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7761)|
| 2:09:25| Great. So now we will move on to our regular agenda at 7.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7765)|
| 2:09:34| Board members, you received emails yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| and also this afternoon, but I wanted to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| out that the wording on item six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| on our regular session agenda was updated to include approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| of the superintendent finalist interview questions and schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| Also, one of the attachments on item 9A to do with the addendums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| for our ESSER 3.0 application was updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| under the section dealing with universal masking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| and an agenda item 11E was added for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| and possible action on the defense of the mask lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7806)|
| 2:10:14| So starting off with the agenda, we'll start with items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| and contracts, C1 and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| Does anybody have any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| Three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| Five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| Seven or eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| Moving to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| M8A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7850)|
| 2:10:55| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| On policy labeled in the agenda, B, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| I don't have the whole thing pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| I'm wondering, based on our conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| I'm wondering if the intent was to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| that to master's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| The change is bachelor's required, master's preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7870)|
| 2:11:14| but I'm just trying to reflect on previous board conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| So, yes, that's what we voted on in our last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| for this actual candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| We wanted the exact, from the committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7888)|
| 2:11:33| we wanted the qualifications from what we voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| on for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7896)|
| 2:11:36| We didn't like that, but we can make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| Yeah, I think that was the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| and I don't know who drafted that actual wording, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| Mr. Duport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| Yeah, I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| So the state law says that a bachelor's is the only degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| that can be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| So that was the reason for, the reason I changed the wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| was that, you know, and we can debate on this, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| the state law indicates bachelor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| So, you know, obviously this system desires somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| with more than a bachelor's, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| So that was the reason for the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| So just to be clear, I think I heard it in your wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| but you said that the state law requires that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| says you can only require up to a bachelor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| I can pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| So if that's what the law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| I totally get the reason why it was worded that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7950)|
| 2:12:33| Yeah, I mean, it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7953)|
| 2:12:33| I believe it says requires only instead of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| it says that that is the only state requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| Not that it's the only degree that we could require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| So if the state law is saying that it's the only requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| then we could add to that requirement, correct, in policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| That's where it's debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7980)|
| 2:13:00| You know, because if I were representing a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| I could argue that that state statute says, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| the law says my candidate only has to have a bachelor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| So, yeah, and it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| So you're saying the more cautious way to go in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| of policy is to put the preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| and although when we do hire candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| we can certainly make it required at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| like we did this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Well, you can make that part of the vetting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8010)|
| 2:13:31| So I believe that our criteria for TSBA was the master's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| So, yeah, that was actually in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| So most, I guess all the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| that they bring forth will meet that criteria, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Mr. Dupler, should we add language that says specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8032)|
| 2:13:59| that an individual search process might require a higher degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8039)|
| 2:14:08| or that the board has the authority to require a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| degree in their qualifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| Because I don't want our qualifications in our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| to be in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8060)|
| 2:14:26| It's a tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| I mean, I don't know that any courts ever looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| But again, I mean, I would, based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| upon the way the state law reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| a candidate could argue that that candidate should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| be able to apply and get a shot just based on a bachelor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| Now, I mean, if this board wants to say a doctorate's preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| I think this board could do that and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| at a list of candidates and say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| we've got 15 doctorates, two masters, and one bachelor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| And you all can create a priority list based upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| I don't see any legal problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| But I do see a legal problem based upon the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| by just saying we require a master's or a doctorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8114)|
| 2:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8121)|
| 2:15:21| I understand the way you said it, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| So are we good, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| Do you have any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| So board policies, item C or D. Item E. And item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8129)|
| 2:15:52| We do have public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| And you wonder, oh, I get confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| That would be Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| Wednesday night, we'll have it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| During policy review, I supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| having a policy to express our commitment to equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| But I didn't see that our committee reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| any kind of consensus at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| And so I wasn't really expecting to see this policy come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| My expectation was that it was going to be reworked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| and that we would see it again in policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| and have some more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| So I don't want to limit community forum on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| But I would like to send this back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| so that we could have significantly more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| discussion on the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8203)|
| 2:16:50| There's, I guess, I don't need to get too deeply in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| But my concern is that when we characterize equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| we're really defining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8220)|
| 2:17:02| And this definition of equity is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| one that we can find anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| It's not backed up by any definitions of equity in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| I've looked everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| So if we're looking in just a regular dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| if we are looking in a British English dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| if we are looking in a law dictionary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| this definition isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| That doesn't necessarily concern me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| as much as any kind of unintended consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8252)|
| 2:17:38| that could come from this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| And so I think we need to really have an extended time when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| we can look at this language and have some advice on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| kind of unintended impacts this broad definition could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8271)|
| 2:17:58| So if we could send it back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| for that discussion, I support having an equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| But I think we really need to dig in and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| that we are expressing exactly what we mean to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| Do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8303)|
| 2:18:24| Just to speak to Ms. Owen's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8304)|
| 2:18:28| I know that much of that definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| only because I serve on the committee of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| came from the Alliance for Educational Equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| And I know that that language was presented to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| I think, at the retreat in the form of a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| It wasn't in the policy at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| But that language was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| And I understand your concerns that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| might be elevated to policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| And so I totally get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| I think we need to have a sense from the board as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| whether or not we intend to, I know we're not voting on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| tonight, but if we are going to, then be considerate of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8339)|
| 2:19:06| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| My question has been, why are we looking at this policy now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| Why are we in such a hurry to move forward with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| We have a lot of people who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| And I feel like that in February right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| we need to be focused on hiring a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| That needs to be our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| And we have way too many big things going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| And so that's kind of just my opinion that this need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| And I agreed, actually, the more I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| thought about it with Ms. Christie's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| that we should wait on doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| Because I think that this could open up additional issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| additional things that probably ought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| to be addressed by when we have new leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| So that would be my opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8392)|
| 2:19:57| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8397)|
| 2:19:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| And I hear what you're saying, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| And I hear what you're saying too, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| I would just like to say, kind of in light of both of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| when I came on the board, I was handed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| a copy of board policies, only to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| so many of these policies had not been initiated or written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| And after much study of looking through this packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| I feel like that this policy was conceived and developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| in much the same way by central, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| in collaboration with some board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| But a lot of central office staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| and a lot of outside entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| And there's too many to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| But going through this packet, Title IX coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| and compliance officer, their director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| of advancement and diversity, their director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| of school culture, our chief financial officer, our lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| the executive director, him, his, he of TECA, the AEE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8460)|
| 2:21:08| And then the one that troubled me even more so a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| was, and I could not find a name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| it only constantly was referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| as my contact in Hamilton County, which they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| were looking at their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| And Mr. Dupler may want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| But it concerns me that this process began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| the earliest I could find was maybe like November day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| I don't know if it began before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8498)|
| 2:21:41| But this board as a whole did not get it for policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8501)|
| 2:21:47| until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| And so that concerns me that we had so much input and so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| back and forth going on to develop this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| without the full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| So I could support Ms. Olin or Ms. Horns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8519)|
| 2:22:06| both of their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| And I would like for somebody maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8528)|
| 2:22:11| to send me the answer to who our Hamilton County contact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8531)|
| 2:22:16| that I saw throughout this that spoke to their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8536)|
| 2:22:21| And then also a reference to Ben in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| Who's Ben?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8546)|
| 2:22:26| So those are some of my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| And I just thought I needed to express that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| since the whole policy review thing, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| came about after I took my seat on the board in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| because of the very reasons I enumerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| Given that this goes back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| we have a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| Is this board equipped to provide suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| on what should go into the equity policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8575)|
| 2:22:58| Because I remember our policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| we even had questions about what is equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| So I don't know if even this board is even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| prepared to have a robust discussion at a policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| on what should go into a policy regarding equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| And so I don't want to discredit the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| that central office did to create this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| because we don't know what that means in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| schools as board members from my perspective in my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| sitting on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| And so I thank the experts for giving some type of guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| but I also can see why we need to go back and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| a conversation of the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| But I would also like for board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| to come prepared with their own research, their own studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| about what equity means, and how does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| work in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| Even in policy review, I've not yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| heard any concerns about this policy in the sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| is it harmful for kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8640)|
| 2:24:03| I think that's the intent of this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| is because I think the belief is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| both from disparities of educational outcomes work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| that we've been doing over the last five or seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| as well as the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| One third of our plan is around eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| the work of central office, the Alliance for Educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| Equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| I think the reason this policy is coming to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| is because of years and years of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| And from my understanding, from what Bob said at policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| is that they felt like this was the right next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8670)|
| 2:24:34| to codify this work long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| And I appreciate the logistical concerns, and the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| But what I'd like to know from individual board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| is, do you think this policy is harmful for kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| And if so, in which way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| Because if it's good for kids, then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| think we need to have a real conversation around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| and look at the policy on its merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| The reality is, the disparities that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| see in educational opportunities for our students are pervasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| And they're not just in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| This is not just a Knox County issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| They're all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| And I know there's been many, many things that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| led up to those disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| Very few of those things have we individually or corporately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| as this particular board, have had anything to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| But right now, Bob and this board of nine people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| are the leaders in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| And what I would propose is not abdicating our duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| till we have another leader in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| But if this is the right policy, because it supports kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| and it codifies the work, then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| we need to consider whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| we need to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| Because I think it sends unintended messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| to folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| When you have people who have invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| in this work for the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| and when it comes to the board to codify it in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| we basically say, we don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| On a one page, fairly benign policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| If there's something controversial in this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| I would love to know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| Because I just don't see it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| And I also found it, Ms. Bounds, you referenced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| You held up the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| I find it, frankly, troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| In 16 months of being on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| I've never seen it happen that our board members asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| for three to four months worth of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8787)|
| 2:26:30| to figure out how this policy was created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| To me, that shows a lack of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| And I think everybody who's worked on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| has been genuine in why they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| Now, whether or not you agree that we need it's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| But it's not been out of, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| think there's anybody in the corner that we're trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| that we need to unveil here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| So again, I'd love to hear from board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| how is this harmful to kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| How is this policy harmful to kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| Well, I can speak to the three to four months of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| And that was because when an email went out to parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| back, I believe, in early December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| saying the district was finalizing an equity policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| I had someone ask me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| So I asked to see the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| And I was told we had nothing, and that we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| have anything until the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| So then, after Christmas, I asked to see the draft again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8847)|
| 2:27:32| And we still had nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| So that was, actually, I was one of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| that requested that, just so I could see the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| And it really shouldn't be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| If we had a document, it should have been shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| But just to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| it wasn't a trust thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| It's just that we told parents we had a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| And then when I asked to see it, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8872)|
| 2:27:53| was told we didn't have a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| And that's where those document requests came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| And I think that request was sent to the whole board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| because I remember you making that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| And I saw that line in that email, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| It was not the main subject of the email, but I did see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| I think that was in December, or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| I don't know, from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| and again, I don't have as much experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| as some of you all, I don't ever remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| getting a policy that's in development until policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| I just don't remember seeing early iterations of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| So I guess I wasn't surprised that it wasn't produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| if it was still currently being worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| But again, that's just a logistical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| I don't think we typically send out an email to 60,000 parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| saying that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| So, Ms. Owen, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| To kind of answer Ms. Satterfield's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| I think we can come prepared if we have everything in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| My concern, and looking at all of these different definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8940)|
| 2:29:08| of equity that we could have, my thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| is that if we don't define it very clearly, what we mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| then what we would end up with is a court defining it for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8958)|
| 2:29:26| And one definition that I was looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| is from the National Equity Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| And it says that educational equity means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| that each child receives what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| need to develop to their full academic and social potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8984)|
| 2:29:46| And what could that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| That seems to me like it could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8989)|
| 2:29:52| have an exorbitant cost that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| no way we could fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| And at that point, if we have not defined carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=8997)|
| 2:30:05| and that exorbitant cost comes back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| then that is where harm to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| would happen, because those costs have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| to be transferred from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| So my concern is that we very carefully and intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9018)|
| 2:30:24| find language that we both mean, that we support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9024)|
| 2:30:31| and that we believe does not have legal consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9031)|
| 2:30:39| or potential legal consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9046)|
| 2:30:51| As far as defining it, we've heard two board members just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9051)|
| 2:31:04| say that they weren't sure of what the definition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9064)|
| 2:31:13| And I think from things I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9073)|
| 2:31:20| it could mean one thing locally and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| entirely different in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9083)|
| 2:31:31| or particularly on the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| Now, equity and equality are not the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9095)|
| 2:31:47| I think we could probably agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| If, in reference to something Ms. Owen said over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| about a court deciding a definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| I'm not sure that we can write some kind of definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| to put in at this time that will be all comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9126)|
| 2:32:12| and cover everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9132)|
| 2:32:17| And we certainly don't need to be in court with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| to define or tell us what they think it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9143)|
| 2:32:31| I think we should, my personal feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| are that we should leave it alone for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9155)|
| 2:32:45| We want to go back, and when we get the new superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9165)|
| 2:32:52| and work with them and staff and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9172)|
| 2:32:56| and come up with something that the majority of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9176)|
| 2:33:01| consider satisfactory, then I think that would be OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9181)|
| 2:33:10| But in its present form, because of the uncertainty of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9190)|
| 2:33:19| I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| I mean, when two board members tell you that they're not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9201)|
| 2:33:26| what it means, if you want to define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9206)|
| 2:33:33| Now, I just want to make a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| I'm not sure as the whole board knows what equity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| So I support us getting one understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| I understand what equity means and how it serves the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| But as a board, I don't think we have a clear understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| So I agree on that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9230)|
| 2:33:51| Well, I just don't believe I can support it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9231)|
| 2:33:57| Because I think it is, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| of what Mr. Watson said, I don't think it's so comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9240)|
| 2:34:08| or it could be so comprehensive, that I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9248)|
| 2:34:15| that we can develop something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| Now, as far as does it hurt kids, you ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9258)|
| 2:34:22| I don't think it hurts kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9262)|
| 2:34:25| But are we going to, if we adopted a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| are we going to try to spend enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| to make sure that there is equity in outcomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9275)|
| 2:34:44| Is that what you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| So I think equity in outcomes, that's even scratched out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| We talked about that at the policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| and changed that to equitable opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| I actually don't know that many people believe everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| should end up in the exact same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| I don't think that's the way life works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| No, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9310)|
| 2:35:11| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| So I think it really is about opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| And what's interesting in this conversation tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| we've all been talking about equity even before this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9319)|
| 2:35:22| When we talked about the Ford and Yale work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| that was an equity conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| When Mr. Jin was asking all of his questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| that was an equity conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| What's interesting is most of us in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| even if we don't know the definition of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| we want equity for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| And what that means is I want the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| that I need based on my circumstances, the way I grew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| up, the way I identify, the challenges I've experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9343)|
| 2:35:46| my aptitudes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| I need certain things that are different than you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| because of where I'm trying to end up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| where I want to get to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9351)|
| 2:35:52| And that's what all equity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| Because what we have acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| is that if we give everybody something equal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| we're not all starting out in the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| and we're not all trying to end up in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| So what ends up happening is you get disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| like we see in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| And so we do the work of equity all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| And our Disparities in Educational Outcomes Task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| Force originally came up with 36 recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9374)|
| 2:36:17| based on data that you all have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9377)|
| 2:36:20| It's publicly available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| 34 of those have been completed or are in work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| because they're the kind of thing that never ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| And so as all systems work has progressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| then the administration and that steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| said, now how do we continue to move this work forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| And so they developed the Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| for Educational Equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| Nathan Langelois and Brianna and others within the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| and she's an attorney, said, how do we then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| align this to the work both at a federal level through ESSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| Every Student Succeeds Act, and the Tennessee Leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| for Equity Playbook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| And so the reason they did that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| because that steering committee, the Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| for Educational Equity, needs a guiding light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9421)|
| 2:37:04| They need to know, what are we going to focus our energies in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| And so what they said is it makes the most sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| to align it to ESSA and what the State Department of Ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| has said, which is why these seven commitments are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| Decreasing chronic absenteeism, reducing disproportionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| suspension expulsion rates, increasing student early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| post-secondary ed opportunities, providing equitable access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9442)|
| 2:37:25| to effective teachers, recruiting and retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| a diverse teaching force, embed cultural awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9449)|
| 2:37:32| in our schools, and partnering with community allies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| So the six equity teams that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| in the Alliance for Educational Equity, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| are within the district and also embedded in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| they're saying, we need to know how to focus our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| Well, guess who they look to to know how to focus their work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| The board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9469)|
| 2:37:50| That's why this policy is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| Because they're saying to us, we want to work for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| We want to help our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| We want to help eliminate those disparities in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| But the work has been at play now for six, seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9482)|
| 2:38:06| and we're looking for you for our cue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| And what I'm concerned about is knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| how many people have been passionate involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9492)|
| 2:38:13| in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| If this board doesn't give a cue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| it sends an unintentional signal that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| don't value your participation in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9499)|
| 2:38:22| Because at the end of the day, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9502)|
| 2:38:23| doesn't matter who's sitting in Bob's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| This entity, this board, is the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| that is supposed to lay the direction for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| And then we hire a superintendent to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| And frankly, I want to know if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| committed to this work before I make a vote on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| Because I want to give a clear signal to that superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| that we want you to continue this work of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9530)|
| 2:38:51| We want you to continue this work of eliminating disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9534)|
| 2:38:55| And I will tell you, if any one of those candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| is not for that, I can't support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9537)|
| 2:39:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| So Ms. Zillen, before we get to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9542)|
| 2:39:09| I would like to get a good feel for if the majority of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| is wanting to go back to policy review with this or proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9555)|
| 2:39:20| So after we have the discussion, if you can just everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| kind of weigh in on that so we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9564)|
| 2:39:25| know how to proceed on Wednesday with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| I believe I actually had the floor and I gave it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| I'm sorry, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9575)|
| 2:39:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| I just wanted to ask Mr. Watson there, do you think, you talked about these seven, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9577)|
| 2:39:51| seven things that are listed there, do you believe that with a new superintendent we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9591)|
| 2:39:59| could not continue to work on them or do you believe we're not working on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9599)|
| 2:40:05| Do you believe the staff is not working on them at the present time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9605)|
| 2:40:12| Or do you think that they're just ignoring you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9612)|
| 2:40:17| I want him to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I do believe they're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| I serve on that committee and I see their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| And I know when people are in the systems and they're working toward an end, they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| to see that the leaders of that system support them in that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9637)|
| 2:40:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9638)|
| 2:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| I don't want to length the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9640)|
| 2:40:41| I just want to know whether you believe that we were working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| I think we're doing a pretty good job as best we can with the monies that we've been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9646)|
| 2:40:55| and with the positions that we could create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| And I believe whoever our new superintendent is will take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9658)|
| 2:41:04| There's nothing to prevent that person from moving forward on those if the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9664)|
| 2:41:14| the board directs them to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| So that's why I think since it's come up, I think it's unnecessary at this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9677)|
| 2:41:24| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9685)|
| 2:41:26| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9686)|
| 2:41:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| I have a question for Mr. Dupler and I apologize I haven't asked this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9688)|
| 2:41:36| We have at least nine other policies that very directly mention equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9696)|
| 2:41:43| If we define equity in C-260, could that impact the other nine policies that also address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9703)|
| 2:41:52| equity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| Ms. Owen, I'd have to look up C-260.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| That's the one we're talking about now, the equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9725)|
| 2:42:06| So if we define it differently than the legal definition, if we define it here, could that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9726)|
| 2:42:15| impact our other nine policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| Do we need to go back and look at those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| So the problem is what you stated earlier, which is what's the legal definition of equity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9739)|
| 2:42:27| And when one looks up the legal definition of equity, it doesn't mean what it's stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| in this proposed policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| It talks about courts of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| It goes back to old England law and what happens when there's not a remedy, a common law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9757)|
| 2:42:46| That's what legally equity talks about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| Further, this board has policies for equal educational opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| We've had those since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, since Title IX came into play in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9775)|
| 2:43:04| 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9784)|
| 2:43:05| So what do you do with that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| Because basically, if you're talking about categories, protected categories, race, color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| creed, religion, national origin, sex, or disabilities, if you are treating somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| differently, then is that discriminatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9802)|
| 2:43:27| Those are the legal considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9813)|
| 2:43:34| I was looking back at my notes from our policy review meeting, and I think to Ms. Owen's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9814)|
| 2:43:38| point, I have probably five or six questions on here that say, what does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| What does this plan to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Does this mean moving staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| I think this opens up more questions than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| And I also, in just reviewing this packet, just for this week, we do have the equal educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9833)|
| 2:44:01| opportunities, J110, that, as Mr. Duklar just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9841)|
| 2:44:07| So I think this policy just opens up more questions than it answers, and I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9847)|
| 2:44:13| about what it could lead to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| And I think that, as Mr. McMillan made the point, definitions right now are changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9860)|
| 2:44:21| You know, words don't mean the same thing from week to week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| So I think that, I just think this is not where we need to be right now on a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9865)|
| 2:44:31| of this sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| Yeah, and I hear you loud and clear, and there's not going to be too much rebuttal that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9876)|
| 2:44:41| but I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| If you have your central office, the people who work for, superintendent who works for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9883)|
| 2:44:48| us, asking for clarity from the leadership on what direction do we need to go in, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9888)|
| 2:44:53| do we guide them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| I think we have, we have our, I think we expect as a board, we expect them to be following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9896)|
| 2:45:01| our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| And we're doing a lot, I'm not, we're doing, most all of these things are being addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| I think every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| But I think we expect for them to follow the strategic plan, and a lot of these elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| I think the issue is, back to Ms. Owens' point, this opens up a lot more questions and possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| problems than it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9921)|
| 2:45:25| And I don't dispute that, right, I'm cool with going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| We have that in the strategic plan, the strategic plan has been in existence for, what, five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| years now, four years, et cetera, and we still have stark disparities in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| So there's something that's, there's just something that's not connecting, and while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9940)|
| 2:45:45| we have equity and people are doing equity, doing this work for years before, don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9945)|
| 2:45:52| a policy to do the work, right, I think about Beaumont Magnet, they're doing the work, don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| need us to guide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| We have schools in our county that are not doing it, and so a policy flat out says everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9958)|
| 2:46:03| expected to do it in this way, because this is the board's expectation for everyone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9963)|
| 2:46:08| Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| And so while we do have communities that's doing it well, we do not, we have communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| that are not doing it well, so this is just a guiding light when we have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9973)|
| 2:46:17| Now what that policy says, I'm cool with us as a board figuring it out and pulling in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9977)|
| 2:46:22| from other policies as well, but we don't have a guiding light in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| to make sure everybody is infusing equity within our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| Well, once again, I think the strategic plan needs to be doing that, but I think we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9991)|
| 2:46:36| we still have a difference of definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| I think that when Mr. McMillan mentioned equitable outcomes, we, that's a definition issue, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=9998)|
| 2:46:46| we may have a disconnect with what we're saying and what the community is saying, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| there's, we can't, we cannot guarantee any kind of outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10010)|
| 2:46:56| We just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| I mean, that's not reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| And so there's an example of a disconnect between what we may think and what the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| may think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| So I just think that, I think that there may be other issues at play that could be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10025)|
| 2:47:16| with what you said about the disparities that are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| And I don't even, you know, I'm not, there's, we have 90 schools, so there's a lot of, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| know, a lot of people at play, a lot of issues at play that could be individual issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| But I think that the district has put a lot of things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| I think they're following the strategic plan, which is what we expect for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| So I believe I'm hearing the majority of the board would support sending this back to policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10058)|
| 2:47:47| review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10067)|
| 2:47:48| Is that, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Ms. Babb, I don't, Ms. Henderson, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10069)|
| 2:47:57| If you want me to weigh in, I, I, we can't take a vote, but I unfortunately could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10077)|
| 2:48:03| be at the policy review and have had a lot of questions and, Lord, we've had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10083)|
| 2:48:11| people that decided to weigh in really on one side thinking we were being bullied by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| another side, which was actually sort of ironic, because I actually felt bullied on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| one side because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10099)|
| 2:48:23| But I, you know, I think the fact that we have this many questions that I, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10103)|
| 2:48:29| I did not get to be at policy review, so I didn't know it, but Lord, I'm realizing how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10109)|
| 2:48:34| many, like, I think policy review is the place to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| And, you know, I understand what you're saying, Mr. Watson, but I feel like you're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10118)|
| 2:48:42| to push it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| If we all do this this month, then we're just failing everybody, but I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| failing people if we don't really have more discussion when there's this much problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10127)|
| 2:48:55| Because like I said, I couldn't be at the policy review, so I don't know what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| on, but just from the discussion tonight, I'm realizing how many different points of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| view there are, how many of these bullet points that some people think are just concrete and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| clear as can be are not by other people, and that's what policy review is for, where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10146)|
| 2:49:11| really have discussion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| So if we're voting on it, I guess, next week, then I would probably say I would support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| it to go back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| So what would need to happen if somebody would have to make a motion on Wednesday to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| and then we would take a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10169)|
| 2:49:30| Yes, and I just want to, and I'm cool with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| Board members' responsibility is to govern the superintendent, manage the budget, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| create policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| So if we have this come back to the policy review, please come with suggestions so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| we can create the policy and not central offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| Input was from central office because they're doing the work, and they're telling us this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| But board members' responsibility is to create a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| So let's create a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| And I guess the one other thing I'd say is we've had many policies that we have decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10196)|
| 2:50:04| to send back to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10204)|
| 2:50:05| I mean, this is not like an original thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| And this is big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| I mean, I think everybody says, I mean, it's a big discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| If we're going to pass it, we want to do something that people can feel good about, not feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| pressured one way or the other by some side sending me more emails than another side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10216)|
| 2:50:21| which that doesn't work for me, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| I don't keep tallies of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10223)|
| 2:50:27| Never have, never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| And I just think, and it doesn't even necessarily mean one policy review will get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10229)|
| 2:50:36| Policy review, we don't, and this is where I think the public gets really confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| We can't talk about this stuff in a lot of venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| And a lot of times, these school board meetings are not a good place to have really healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| discussion about important stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| And to me, just the amount of questions that have come up tonight makes me realize those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10251)|
| 2:50:56| questions did not get answered in the last policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| And I don't know if they'll get invited in the next one, but I mean, I do, I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| agree with Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| People need to come prepared with their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| If we want people, staff people to come discuss it with us, I think we need to be asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| that at the next policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| But from everything I'm hearing tonight, I don't think with any confidence people can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| vote one way or the other about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10278)|
| 2:51:21| And the cell phone policy comes to mind when you say review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10281)|
| 2:51:25| I mean, so it isn't unusual to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10285)|
| 2:51:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10288)|
| 2:51:30| So moving on to grants, and any questions on non-A or B, C or D, item E, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10290)|
| 2:51:55| I want the board to be aware that Wednesday night, I intend to make a motion and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10315)|
| 2:52:07| like to kind of tell the board what that motion is so they'll know on Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10327)|
| 2:52:14| So a motion to reiterate that Knox County Schools is substantially complying with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| court-ordered mask mandate and to state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| Which one are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10344)|
| 2:52:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| Oh, are we doing the charter reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| You skipped the whole section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| Your page is stuck together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10350)|
| 2:52:31| I just want to go home, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| The page is stuck together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10352)|
| 2:52:33| That's on the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10355)|
| 2:52:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| But when we get to that one, I'll get you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10357)|
| 2:52:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| So item and contracts, 10A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| I think it talks about regular agenda items B and C. It sounds like looking at those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10372)|
| 2:53:00| maybe the halls, high school, exterior upgrades change along the way, and so maybe if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10380)|
| 2:53:06| just talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10389)|
| 2:53:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| Three of those items are related to one another, and this project started off a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10391)|
| 2:53:18| ago as part of the capital plan, and we've added funds, and the scope of the thing has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10398)|
| 2:53:23| changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| Our original intent was just to take a look at how to clean up the exterior of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10405)|
| 2:53:32| and we found out that there were some parts of the building that we couldn't clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10412)|
| 2:53:38| in detail without damage to it, and then we have found other areas where we had some water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10418)|
| 2:53:44| intrusion and some degradation to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10424)|
| 2:53:50| So the scope of the project sort of creeped up on us, and as we've gone back and looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| at it, where we are now in order to clean up the appearance of the building and to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10436)|
| 2:54:07| the fact that we've got significant, I think, window problems there, is this project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10447)|
| 2:54:13| now to replace the windows at the school and then to add some cladding, metal cladding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10453)|
| 2:54:23| that would cover some of the aggregate, or cover the aggregate cast stone that is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10463)|
| 2:54:29| of the building and that is beginning to deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| So that's what we're going for with this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10473)|
| 2:54:39| Over that period of time, we have in the budget $2 million for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10479)|
| 2:54:48| As the project has, the scope has changed, it's required some additional work for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10488)|
| 2:54:54| architects, so it means we need to pay the architects for that additional work, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10494)|
| 2:54:59| is the amendment to the architectural contract that is in the next section, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10499)|
| 2:55:09| fund balance designation for $700,000 is to get us to where we can afford the roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10509)|
| 2:55:15| $2.5 million that the project will cost as we've gotten to what the current scope of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10515)|
| 2:55:22| the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10522)|
| 2:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| I could tell something had changed over time just reading through it, and then I just know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10524)|
| 2:55:29| that just labor and materials costs have gone up astronomically, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| This was one of those things that we started that was really a cosmetic and has turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| into more than that as we sort of peeled back layers of the onion and want to address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10538)|
| 2:55:44| appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10546)|
| 2:55:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| Russ answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| It was just that all that was tied together, the three items that are on there, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| the architect, means that we'll spend over $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10557)|
| 2:56:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10564)|
| 2:56:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10565)|
| 2:56:06| The architect is part of the budget in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10566)|
| 2:56:19| This is an increase of $67,870.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10587)|
| 2:56:28| Where is it included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| Is it in the original contract with the architect in which we engaged probably a year ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10590)|
| 2:56:43| Well, I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10603)|
| 2:56:46| I just want to be able to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10606)|
| 2:56:51| The fee would come out of what's listed there in T&A, $2.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10611)|
| 2:57:09| Let me do a little math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| This is dangerous territory, doing math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| We originally had $2 million that the board had approved for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10636)|
| 2:57:21| Out of that, we have taken the architectural fees, which would include the increase in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10641)|
| 2:57:28| the architectural fee that we're recommending here, and then the $700,000 will take us from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10648)|
| 2:57:35| that roughly $1.8 million that's remaining out of the $2 million to cover the $2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10655)|
| 2:57:43| that is the current construction bid on that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10663)|
| 2:57:46| And, Mike, if you'll look at 11C, there's like a letter from Lewis that kind of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| a lot of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10671)|
| 2:57:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10672)|
| 2:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| I didn't look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| I mean, I was just looking at the numbers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| It gives the appearance that they're separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10678)|
| 2:58:04| It talks about the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10684)|
| 2:58:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| I didn't look at the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| I didn't realize that that was a part of the original part, so it wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| I'm sorry if we weren't clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10698)|
| 2:58:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| Ms. Zola?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10700)|
| 2:58:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| So, the grand total is $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| No, the grand total would, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10714)|
| 2:58:39| Yes, ma'am, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10719)|
| 2:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10720)|
| 2:58:41| $2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10721)|
| 2:58:42| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10722)|
| 2:58:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10723)|
| 2:58:44| Just on a technical issue, because the $67,000 is referenced in Item 11B within that $700,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10724)|
| 2:58:52| I would just change the order of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| It seems odd to vote on an item that has that number and the detail, but then be asked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10734)|
| 2:58:59| vote on that detail next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| So, I would just split B and C in the agenda for tomorrow when we vote, would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10741)|
| 2:59:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10746)|
| 2:59:07| Wednesday, yes, whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10749)|
| 2:59:10| The day we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10750)|
| 2:59:11| I'd like to correct myself, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| And Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10757)|
| 2:59:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10758)|
| 2:59:19| The original budget was $2 million out of which we paid architectural fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10759)|
| 2:59:24| We're adding $700,000 to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| So, what our total for the project would be $2.7, not $2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10767)|
| 2:59:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| So, we're good on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10776)|
| 2:59:37| We're good on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10777)|
| 2:59:38| So, that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10778)|
| 2:59:39| So, under contracts, Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10779)|
| 2:59:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| Actually, I guess I missed Item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| Can we just have a little quick explanation of Item B, if that's a new contract and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10790)|
| 2:59:57| purpose for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| Mr. McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| Actually, yes, this is a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| And it is budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| So, this is actually software to automate many of our accounts payable and business-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10808)|
| 3:00:13| functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| It cuts down on a lot of manual tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| There's some built-in accountability here as well for compliance to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10817)|
| 3:00:25| And also, there are also policy controls that are built into this particular software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| And it reduces risks associated with manual processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10831)|
| 3:00:35| And it creates audit transparencies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| So, anyway, it's far more effective than manual processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| But it'll create a lot of efficiencies in the department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| It also speeds up payment processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| So, there's a lot of features with this particular software that we think are really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10852)|
| 3:00:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10857)|
| 3:01:00| I'm glad you asked the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| But also, I was wondering, it has a year one cost and a year two cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10862)|
| 3:01:06| Is there costs after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10866)|
| 3:01:08| Or is it paid off in two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| This would be ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| But there's kind of an implementation cost, right, initially, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| So, like the first year is high, but probably years going forward are more like $116,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10876)|
| 3:01:22| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| I'll double check with their director of business services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| But that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10888)|
| 3:01:29| If that's not the case, I will correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| Okay, and I'm sure there may be yearly increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| But that was just my big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| There was just a year one and a year two on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Yes, typically there's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10898)|
| 3:01:40| The difference between the $452,000 and the $116,000, that's just the implementation cost of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10900)|
| 3:01:46| And then going forward, it's probably going to be more like $116,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10906)|
| 3:01:50| Or, you know, there could be a slight inflationary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10910)|
| 3:01:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| So, any questions on 10C under contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10918)|
| 3:02:05| So, moving to regular agenda items, and a couple of these have already been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10925)|
| 3:02:10| But 11A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10936)|
| 3:02:21| So, 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| And before I get to you, Ms. Bounds, I will just, just a background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| So, of course, the board did receive the email from the law department on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| And there were some, well, I know I personally had some back and forths with the law department over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10955)|
| 3:02:43| And I'm assuming by a follow-up email, other board members had questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| And in that email, he said that, you know, the board does need to have some public discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10969)|
| 3:02:57| on how we would want them to proceed with the request that the plaintiffs made as far as mask compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10977)|
| 3:03:10| And also, I called Superintendent Thomas, and we felt this would be a good week to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10990)|
| 3:03:15| So, that is how this landed on the agenda tonight, just to give some background history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=10995)|
| 3:03:22| And I apologize for springing it on everybody late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| But we all know sometimes it's hard to get everybody together for special called meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11006)|
| 3:03:31| So, we kind of felt like it would be better to discuss it sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| And with that, Ms. Bounds, if you would like to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11016)|
| 3:03:44| Well, when I read the most recent request from the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| I intended to bring a motion tonight to be made on Wednesday for possible action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11029)|
| 3:03:56| and then you added this for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| So, I'm very appreciative of you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| My motion Wednesday night, and I hope there will be the votes to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| will be a motion to reiterate that Knox County Schools is substantially complying with the court-ordered mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11047)|
| 3:04:15| and to state there is no need to acquiesce to the most recent demands of the plaintiffs in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11055)|
| 3:04:22| Specifically, the Knox County Board of Education, one, will not agree to the appointment of a neutral monitor for schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11062)|
| 3:04:31| two, will not submit a compliance plan as stated by the plaintiffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11071)|
| 3:04:37| and three, will not agree to a three-person compliance committee chosen by the plaintiffs, KCE, KCS, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11077)|
| 3:04:47| So, that is the motion that I will bring to the board on Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11087)|
| 3:04:52| I hope the votes are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| I think enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| When I read these most recent demands, I think they go above and beyond the mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11096)|
| 3:05:03| That is the motion, but I do want to explain that I do not think that it is a good idea to send a neutral monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11103)|
| 3:05:13| that has the authority to make unannounced visits to any Knox County school and extracurricular activities and report back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11113)|
| 3:05:21| Neither do I think it is a good idea of identifying monitors for each school that includes random visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11121)|
| 3:05:30| a complaint procedure, training for proper masking, and a system of discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11130)|
| 3:05:37| The same thing is true with the compliance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11137)|
| 3:05:42| I think it sends a very bad message to our students and our parents and our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11142)|
| 3:05:49| that we are sending people in to spy and to monitor on them, and I think it is totally unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11149)|
| 3:06:00| So, do we have any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| I would like to add, I know we were all very frustrated probably today in executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11164)|
| 3:06:13| and that might be an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| I do have some concerns in my bringing requests on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11177)|
| 3:06:24| You know, I, having a child that had a severe speech impairment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11184)|
| 3:06:32| I do have concerns that we have, and I checked with Mr. Myers today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11192)|
| 3:06:38| 3,353 students in the district that are currently getting speech services, but they do not have mask exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11198)|
| 3:06:49| And speech impairments are actually recognized under the ADA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| and I do think that we need to offer these students exemptions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11214)|
| 3:06:59| and I would like for the law department to pursue a blanket exemption for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11219)|
| 3:07:10| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11230)|
| 3:07:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11233)|
| 3:07:14| I think my question is for Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| Do we still have funds available for supplies like masks for students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11236)|
| 3:07:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11244)|
| 3:07:25| We can get whatever we want, whatever we need, and we have plenty of masks on hand right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11245)|
| 3:07:32| and we replenish that as the need arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11252)|
| 3:07:36| Of those funds, would it be possible to order some that have the clear front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11256)|
| 3:07:44| If we can find them, we could certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| I don't know what the efficacy of those is or are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11268)|
| 3:07:52| There's a disposable version, too, so I can send you those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11272)|
| 3:07:56| and that way maybe there wouldn't have to be so many exemptions if they had those available also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11276)|
| 3:08:03| I would like to get them out of these masks as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11283)|
| 3:08:06| I think a year and a half is long enough, and it's just going to further delay those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11286)|
| 3:08:11| I do have concerns that they can't see their teachers' mouths, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11291)|
| 3:08:16| I mean, that's part of it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11296)|
| 3:08:17| It's not just the teachers needing to see their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| They need to see other people's faces when they speak, too, and it just really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| I feel like we're discriminating against these students by not giving them mask exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11307)|
| 3:08:35| With the board's support, and that's something everybody can think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| I would ask that you support them pursuing those exemptions for those 3,353 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11319)|
| 3:08:49| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| This is a difficult subject, and once again, I'm going to bring up we don't ever have an opportunity to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11334)|
| 3:09:01| This has kind of been the first opportunity that we could discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11341)|
| 3:09:06| One of the things I'll bring up is back when we first started talking about this at the beginning of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11346)|
| 3:09:10| I was for doing a mask mandate only because I wanted us to have control over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11350)|
| 3:09:17| because I do think when we were first starting school, Delta was taking off and people were scared about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11357)|
| 3:09:24| but then it dipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| My impression and what my mind was was it would be great if we could control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11367)|
| 3:09:32| If we thought it was bad, if conditions in the community were bad, then we could have masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| and then when it wasn't so bad, we could take away that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| I think what I find very frustrating about this lawsuit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| and I know everybody else in the world is finding the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11385)|
| 3:09:48| I'm sure there are a few people who disagree, is there is no end to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| but we are seeing, we were talking about it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11392)|
| 3:09:57| there are states that have had mandates that have gotten rid of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11397)|
| 3:10:01| there are countries that have had mandates that have gotten rid of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| and as Knox County Schools, and I realize right now Omicron is very prevalent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11404)|
| 3:10:10| we have a lot of cases, but if Knoxville follows the trend of the rest of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11410)|
| 3:10:16| it will dramatically start going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| We don't know when that's going to happen, but it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11418)|
| 3:10:21| and there are some predictions that then it might just even be treated as the common cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11421)|
| 3:10:26| We don't know that yet, and once again that's for scientists to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11426)|
| 3:10:30| but with this lawsuit, our kids are still in masks no matter what's going on in the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11430)|
| 3:10:36| and I think that's what I find very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| One thing I would love, and once again this would have to be a consideration of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| and I know there are very different thoughts on our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| is I would love to have initiated talks, and I've brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| is mediation with the plaintiffs to see if there is any kind of end game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11450)|
| 3:10:56| and I don't know that there's support on our board about that, because that is to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11456)|
| 3:11:01| I'm hearing from parents of like when does this end, and we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11461)|
| 3:11:06| and that's one thing I think we need to let people out there know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| We as a board do not know when this is going to end, and we right now have no control over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11469)|
| 3:11:14| and I would love to at least have conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11474)|
| 3:11:18| and those conversations might end in something that we cannot agree to, that we don't want to agree to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11478)|
| 3:11:23| but I would love for us just to try and see if we can get somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11483)|
| 3:11:29| and so I might also, and it might not go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| but I probably will put something forward to ask our attorneys if they could try to initiate mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11492)|
| 3:11:40| or conversations with the plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| Yeah, I agree, and I mean just the frustration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| I mean I don't think that the general public realizes how the charter government set up that yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11507)|
| 3:11:56| we are the defendants, but we have very little say in how we are being defended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11516)|
| 3:12:03| You know, they think that we are directing the law department to do this or directing the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| and that is simply not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| You know, I said it in an executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| My response to the plaintiffs would have been very different than the law department's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11535)|
| 3:12:21| and I'm sorry, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11541)|
| 3:12:24| It would happen, but I just don't think people understand that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| we're not deliberating in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| We're not calling the shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| I mean we hear about it as things are happening and pretty much when everybody else kind of hears about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11555)|
| 3:12:43| so that is a frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| Did you want to speak to that, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| I mean I'll say what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| Obviously there's not a whole lot I can say due to active litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11573)|
| 3:12:58| As you've stated, the charter enables our office to defend this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11578)|
| 3:13:05| and this board was sued, and we are defending the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11585)|
| 3:13:13| We have to go upon what the board as a whole decides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11593)|
| 3:13:18| so I think that's part of this board's frustration because, I mean, you're nine individual members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11598)|
| 3:13:23| You have different thoughts on this lawsuit and a lot of other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| and until you make a decision officially in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11608)|
| 3:13:35| it's hard for us to know which direction you all want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| You all made a decision before the fall semester to remove masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11618)|
| 3:13:43| so we have been defending you on the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| and then we will certainly look at that decision and defend your decision because that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11626)|
| 3:13:55| So, I mean, that's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| I mean I can also say that the superintendent has been pushing out messages with our cooperation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11638)|
| 3:14:08| and this thing is appealed up to the Sixth Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11648)|
| 3:14:14| and the briefing schedule has been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11654)|
| 3:14:19| The Sixth Circuit will issue a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| Some people have the misperception that they already issued a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| That was a very preliminary motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| They did not consider all the facts, so the Sixth Circuit will issue a decision sometime hopefully in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11667)|
| 3:14:35| and then we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| The only thing I would say about the recent motion is that we'll respond to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11678)|
| 3:14:45| and to the plaintiff's attorneys and to the new sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| Our office has not been dishonest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11693)|
| 3:14:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11697)|
| 3:14:58| I just want to say that I agree with Virginia's plan of having mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11698)|
| 3:15:05| I think it's ridiculous that the attorneys at the law department has not reached out to these plaintiffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11705)|
| 3:15:10| and sat down with these plaintiffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11710)|
| 3:15:12| And five minutes ago, California just lifted their indoor mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11712)|
| 3:15:17| one of the most blue states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11717)|
| 3:15:20| Delaware lifted theirs, New Jersey, Connecticut, Denver, all blue states, and here our children are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11720)|
| 3:15:27| I'm a parent with a child with dyslexia that wears glasses, and she is still in a mask two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11727)|
| 3:15:33| Her reading is suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| She's in fifth grade and reads on a third grade level right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11735)|
| 3:15:38| What is that going to look like in sixth grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| We need to get these kids out of these masks immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| So if you know the board just comes prepared with whatever they want us to collectively consider Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11747)|
| 3:15:57| then we can move forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| So Ms. Henderson, you were done, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11761)|
| 3:16:06| Actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| I also want to say there are several articles that have come out today in the past couple days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11769)|
| 3:16:14| from experts, medical experts from Harvard who have been advocating for masks all along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11774)|
| 3:16:21| and this past week are saying universal masking is no longer the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11781)|
| 3:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| And so board members, this concludes our regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| We have several people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| Do we need a quick break before we proceed with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| So do we want to do 10, 15 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11800)|
| 3:16:48| We'll come back at 845.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| Not a minute late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| For Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11811)|
| 3:16:58| So we will be moving on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| And with that, Ms. Satterfield, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| As we prepare for public forum, I want to let everyone know that when you come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11824)|
| 3:17:11| please state your name and county of residence and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11831)|
| 3:17:14| We will make sure we stay within those three-minute barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11834)|
| 3:17:18| So please be respectful when we call the next name up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11838)|
| 3:17:22| And with that, we will start with Jamie Singer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| Name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11848)|
| 3:17:29| Thank you, Madam Vice Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| My name is Jamie Singer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| I live in Knox County and my child attends Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11853)|
| 3:17:37| I'm also a member of the Smoky Mountain District United Methodist Women's leadership team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11857)|
| 3:17:43| The United Methodist Women is a faith-based organization that has been advocating for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11863)|
| 3:17:48| in education for over 150 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| We are supportive of and endorse the proposed equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11871)|
| 3:17:57| Recently, we learned that this effort at Knox County Schools is eight years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11877)|
| 3:18:02| Last month, we held an event where we shared your data from the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11882)|
| 3:18:07| with other United Methodist Women across East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| Interesting, your data indicates that the largest indicator for suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11891)|
| 3:18:15| is not being a member of a disadvantaged group, but being economically disadvantaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11895)|
| 3:18:20| which is not a protected group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| It was clear that students in KCS have already benefited from the effort of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11904)|
| 3:18:30| and it is appropriate now to build on this success by formalizing the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11910)|
| 3:18:36| On your way here tonight, you may have noticed signs in many places of worship on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11916)|
| 3:18:41| that say, Love Your Neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| As women of faith, we know that love bridges all differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11923)|
| 3:18:48| We couldn't help but think this effort to come together is in complete agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11928)|
| 3:18:52| with Knox County Schools' equity efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11932)|
| 3:18:56| In fact, if you combine the two concepts of formalizing the equity policy and loving your neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| we can reduce it to a simple math equation, equity plus love equals student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11942)|
| 3:19:09| We applaud the Knox County Schools and the school board for supporting policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11949)|
| 3:19:13| that recognize and address challenges individual students may face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11953)|
| 3:19:18| We trust you to identify innovative pathways to student success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11958)|
| 3:19:23| that can be applied across the entire school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11963)|
| 3:19:27| After all, these children in your care are the future leaders of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11967)|
| 3:19:32| We ask you for a positive vote in support of the equity policy at your Wednesday meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11972)|
| 3:19:38| and thank you so much for your service to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| Thank you. Next we'll have Pat Bellingrath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| Pat Bellingrath, say your name, county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11984)|
| 3:19:50| My name is Pat Bellingrath and I am from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| I am here to speak to you today, tonight, as a United Methodist woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11994)|
| 3:19:59| a representative of the Tennessee Valley District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=11999)|
| 3:20:02| and as someone who cares deeply for all students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| I and the hundreds of other United Methodist women in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12006)|
| 3:20:10| are advocating for the approval and implementation of the equity and education policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12010)|
| 3:20:17| because it is the right and fair thing to do for students of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12017)|
| 3:20:22| United Methodist women have long promoted inclusion and equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12022)|
| 3:20:27| and our work is about standing up and making our voices heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12027)|
| 3:20:31| and helping others raise theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| We believe education, equal access to resources and opportunities for all children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12033)|
| 3:20:39| is a fundamental right and that the needs of all students must be met and their success is guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12039)|
| 3:20:46| In our communities where disparities affect so many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12046)|
| 3:20:51| let's do everything in our power to create a school policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12051)|
| 3:20:55| that addresses and embraces our diversities and all that they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12055)|
| 3:21:00| Diversity doesn't need to mean inequity or inequality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| Let's help our students be successful so that our community can benefit from these successes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12064)|
| 3:21:10| And by addressing inequity in education, other areas such as discipline may also see significant improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12070)|
| 3:21:17| Let's be an example of lifting up all our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12077)|
| 3:21:20| so that access to an equitable education is a certainty in their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12080)|
| 3:21:26| a certainty that will impact their lives in many positive ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12086)|
| 3:21:32| This policy can be the difference between long-lasting success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| and a life filled with hardship and severe challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12096)|
| 3:21:40| The educational success of each child is paramount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| and this policy will go a long way in addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12103)|
| 3:21:47| We ask this policy be implemented so that each and every child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| will be an example of equity plus love equals success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12111)|
| 3:21:55| A lot of us want change but do not always like the process of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12115)|
| 3:22:01| But we can do this, so let's work together for the sake of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| We know everyone here has the best interest of all Knox County children at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12126)|
| 3:22:11| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| Thank you. Next we'll have Reverend Catherine Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12133)|
| 3:22:16| Reverend Catherine Nance, you have three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12136)|
| 3:22:19| and state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12139)|
| 3:22:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12142)|
| 3:22:24| My name is Catherine Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| I am also a United Methodist woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12146)|
| 3:22:29| I am the senior minister at Church Street United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| I thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| and thank you just from hearing you work tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12155)|
| 3:22:38| for having the well-being of all our children at the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12158)|
| 3:22:42| I am grateful for the work that many have already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| on the equity in education policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| and what a relief and what a gift it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| for a new school superintendent to have this presented to them on day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12171)|
| 3:22:56| to say this is who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12176)|
| 3:22:59| We want to work together with intentionality and goals and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| so that all our children will have access to academic success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12183)|
| 3:23:08| and to say to a new superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| carry on and lead us under this banner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12190)|
| 3:23:17| As a clergy person, as a person of faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12197)|
| 3:23:20| I believe in that song that many of us learned in Sunday school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12200)|
| 3:23:23| or Vacation Bible School, God loves little children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12203)|
| 3:23:26| all the children of the world, red, yellow, black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| they are precious in God's sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| But treating children fairly and equitably is more than a sentiment or a song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| It is the core of who we are as citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| believing that we are all created equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| We do not all have the same gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| We come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12224)|
| 3:23:47| but public education is the foundation of a society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12227)|
| 3:23:51| that believes all citizens should have opportunity to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12231)|
| 3:23:55| to learn and to better themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12235)|
| 3:23:58| I'm a graduate from public schools and my children went to Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| The equity in education policy will ensure that the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12243)|
| 3:24:06| from Every Student Succeeds Act and the Tennessee Succeeds are always present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12246)|
| 3:24:12| You have had the data before you about the disproportionate numbers of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12252)|
| 3:24:17| children of color and children who are economically disadvantaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| who are experiencing chronic absenteeism and suspension and expulsion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| When a child is not in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12265)|
| 3:24:28| they are missing valuable time that we know is nearly impossible to make up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12268)|
| 3:24:33| I know that our teachers and our administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| do have students' best interests at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| This policy will serve as a daily beacon, a guiding light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12279)|
| 3:24:44| and a reminder to all of us about the intentionality of offering all children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12284)|
| 3:24:49| encouragement, opportunity and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| Many have been working on this policy and gathering data for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| and I applaud you for that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12296)|
| 3:24:59| Now is the time to formalize this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| As a citizen of Knox County, I want all of our children to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| that they are not only precious, but they are valued by their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12310)|
| 3:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12311)|
| 3:25:12| Next we'll have Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12312)|
| 3:25:13| Gordon Gibson, if you can say your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12313)|
| 3:25:16| you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12316)|
| 3:25:23| I'm Gordon Gibson, a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| I came here tonight to ask you to vote for the equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12327)|
| 3:25:35| It sounds as though that is going to go back to policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12335)|
| 3:25:40| for further clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| I encourage you to get that clarification quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12343)|
| 3:25:48| and get this policy passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12348)|
| 3:25:53| I think it's important so that we don't have to refer to the Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12353)|
| 3:25:59| for educational something or other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| but can really work on educational equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12363)|
| 3:26:10| I did not come tonight prepared to speak about the recent legal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12370)|
| 3:26:19| about masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| Mr. Gordon, if you could stay on the task of what you presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| which was the policy, the equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12385)|
| 3:26:28| Well, I was speaking to something else that came up on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12388)|
| 3:26:37| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12397)|
| 3:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12402)|

| 3:26:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| Just trying to stay in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12407)|
| 3:26:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12408)|
| 3:26:49| I've spent some time as a federal investigator on civil matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12409)|
| 3:26:56| Sometimes when your hand has been caught in the cookie jar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12416)|
| 3:27:02| it's just as well to say, you caught us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12422)|
| 3:27:08| Here's how we will do better in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12428)|
| 3:27:12| It might be a good idea here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12432)|
| 3:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12434)|
| 3:27:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12435)|
| 3:27:16| Next we'll have Phyllis Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12436)|
| 3:27:31| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12451)|
| 3:27:32| My name is Phyllis Nichols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| and I'm the President and CEO of the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12454)|
| 3:27:37| I first of all want to thank you for your service as a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12457)|
| 3:27:41| Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12461)|
| 3:27:44| The statesman and Tennessee Senator Howard Baker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| if you really want to serve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12467)|
| 3:27:50| then get a job in public service by serving on your local school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12470)|
| 3:27:55| I've had the privilege of working with the last four superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12475)|
| 3:27:59| and many other individuals who have sat in your seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12479)|
| 3:28:04| and I truly believe that our collective goal has been to improve public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12484)|
| 3:28:10| education in our district to benefit all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| There's one phrase that I have heard repeatedly over the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12494)|
| 3:28:20| and I believe I should repeat it again tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| because you say all means all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| It has become a phrase without any kind of action behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| My comments have changed because of the change here tonight in your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12513)|
| 3:28:39| that you have changed not to vote on the policy on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12519)|
| 3:28:43| but to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| I will tell you that I have devoted the better part of my professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12525)|
| 3:28:50| career studying equity and education in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12530)|
| 3:28:55| the state of Tennessee, and across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12535)|
| 3:28:59| A booklet that I have, one of the authors are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| that have been referenced here, the Tennessee Leaders for Equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12542)|
| 3:29:07| the playbook 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| I have worked for the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| This is our second edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| One of the reasons I want to bring that up is because we are caught up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12553)|
| 3:29:18| in Knoxville around the term equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12558)|
| 3:29:21| I have seen many policies go through this body very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12561)|
| 3:29:27| Why is it that we are stuck on not being able to move forward on the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12567)|
| 3:29:33| equity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12573)|
| 3:29:34| Because people across the state, school board leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| fields in education, our people who are preparing teachers in the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12578)|
| 3:29:43| our governor's office, our former governor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| and also our Department of Education came around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12587)|
| 3:29:51| coalesced and worked on an equity definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| And in the field of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| equity means that every student has access to effective teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12598)|
| 3:30:03| resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12603)|
| 3:30:04| I want to tell you that we've kicked this can down the road for too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12604)|
| 3:30:08| And if you need to study to make a wise, intentional decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| I hope that you will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| But I want to leave you with the words of Dr. Martin Luther King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12615)|
| 3:30:18| who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12618)|
| 3:30:19| we must use time creatively in the knowledge that the time is always right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12619)|
| 3:30:24| to do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12624)|
| 3:30:26| And I urge you to do what's right now to adopt the equity policy for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12626)|
| 3:30:31| students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12633)|
| 3:30:34| Next we'll have Joe Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12634)|
| 3:30:36| Next we'll have Joe Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12636)|
| 3:30:38| State your name and county of residence and you'll have three minutes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12638)|
| 3:30:41| speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12641)|
| 3:30:48| My name is Joe B. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12648)|
| 3:30:58| I'm pastor of the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12658)|
| 3:31:02| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12662)|
| 3:31:03| And I'm also a member of Justice Knox Ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12663)|
| 3:31:08| I want to commend you for the work that you've done with regard to at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12668)|
| 3:31:15| least looking at an equity policy for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12675)|
| 3:31:21| And we encourage you to approve one and implement one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12681)|
| 3:31:28| Approve it because it addresses a most important issue, equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12688)|
| 3:31:36| And implement it because regardless of how good it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12696)|
| 3:31:41| if it's not implemented, it has no power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12701)|
| 3:31:47| We may have to clarify some language if you need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12707)|
| 3:31:50| But as it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| it lays the groundwork for reducing disparities and suspensions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12712)|
| 3:31:59| discipline in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12719)|
| 3:32:02| I certainly cannot comprehend for the life of me why any fair-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12722)|
| 3:32:08| person would not want to see all of our children having a fair opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12728)|
| 3:32:16| to be educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| Through Justice Knox house meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12740)|
| 3:32:22| we have heard many stories about how black, brown, poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| and special needs kids are being treated unfairly and more harshly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12746)|
| 3:32:38| than their counterparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12758)|
| 3:32:40| The results of disparities, suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| and discipline actually manifest themselves in the pipelines of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12763)|
| 3:32:49| in the streets, and even in the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12769)|
| 3:32:54| Inequities in our schools is a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12774)|
| 3:32:57| It's not an imaginary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12777)|
| 3:33:01| The data from 2007 and 2016 report and it documents inequities in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12781)|
| 3:33:12| Facts don't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12792)|
| 3:33:15| For 15 years, the needle did not move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12795)|
| 3:33:21| That's a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12801)|
| 3:33:24| We have the ability, we have the aptitude to figure this thing out if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12804)|
| 3:33:34| We are some smart people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12814)|
| 3:33:35| You are some smart people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| Justice Knox is a consortium of 20 congregations totaling about 10,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12817)|
| 3:33:45| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| We just need to make sure that we make sure that all kids are created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12828)|
| 3:33:55| or rather treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| They want to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| They want to see their friends and their fellow students treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12839)|
| 3:34:03| We can no longer deliver this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12843)|
| 3:34:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12846)|
| 3:34:08| Thank you, Superintendent, for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| Next we'll have Courtney Shea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12853)|
| 3:34:24| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12864)|
| 3:34:25| You have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| My name is Courtney Shea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12867)|
| 3:34:28| I live in Knox County at 3926 Beverly Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12868)|
| 3:34:33| I'm a member of Justice Knox, and if some of the other members could stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12873)|
| 3:34:37| or wave your hands, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12877)|
| 3:34:42| In the many school board meetings that I have listened to or attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12882)|
| 3:34:47| it's evident that we all share many of the same goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12887)|
| 3:34:51| helping every Knox County student achieve their dreams by providing an education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12891)|
| 3:34:56| that will prepare them for the demands of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12896)|
| 3:35:00| We share the goal of supporting our schools in their quest to prepare this next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12900)|
| 3:35:04| generation to take on the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12904)|
| 3:35:07| What are the obstacles to achieving those goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12907)|
| 3:35:12| It should be a priority of this board to have an equity policy that supports the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12912)|
| 3:35:17| work of identifying obstacles and developing resources and strategies to allow all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12917)|

| 3:35:30| I had the opportunity to sit in on your annual workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| and to hear Ms. Satterfield's presentation on the role of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12933)|
| 3:35:37| which I heard as describing the board's clear role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12937)|
| 3:35:41| and responsibility to establish policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12941)|
| 3:35:45| and then a shared role with the superintendent on implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12945)|
| 3:35:50| I also sat in on the presentation of Mr. Langlois regarding a strategy for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12950)|
| 3:35:55| achieving the benchmark set forth in the strategic plan of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12955)|
| 3:36:00| for increasing student achievement, eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| and creating a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| His presentation included a description of the reorganization of the DEO task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12965)|
| 3:36:10| force into the Alliance for Educational Equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| He described the Tennessee plan set forth in the Tennessee Leaders for Equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12974)|
| 3:36:19| playbook and the seven commitments set forth in the Tennessee plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12979)|
| 3:36:23| and he described a proposed definition of equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12983)|
| 3:36:29| If the school board is committed to equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| then it's the board's responsibility to reflect that in its policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12991)|
| 3:36:36| KCS staff and the new superintendent may need to strategize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=12996)|
| 3:36:42| They may need to work with the Alliance for Educational Equity to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13002)|
| 3:36:46| bringing in new resources and to consider the perspective of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13006)|
| 3:36:51| But each of these individuals and groups needs your guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13011)|
| 3:36:55| This equity, each of these groups needs an equity policy that provides guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13015)|
| 3:37:01| and we ask you to implement one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13021)|
| 3:37:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| Next we'll have Claudia Calvero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13027)|
| 3:37:19| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13039)|
| 3:37:20| You have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13040)|
| 3:37:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13042)|
| 3:37:23| I'm Claudia Calvero, and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13043)|
| 3:37:26| Thank you, school board, for everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13046)|
| 3:37:28| Thanks for everyone who's here tonight with their feelings and ideas and expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13048)|
| 3:37:34| As some of you may know, I'm the CEO of Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13054)|
| 3:37:37| We're the Latino-serving organization of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13057)|
| 3:37:40| Today I don't come here speaking only for the children and Latino community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13060)|
| 3:37:44| I'd also like to share part of my personal story and why I believe so strongly that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13064)|
| 3:37:48| each child is meaningful for our children, our families, and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13068)|
| 3:37:53| Five, same mother, same father, same environment, same rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13073)|
| 3:37:57| They wanted the same outcomes for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| They want us to be healthy and happy and financially independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13079)|
| 3:38:03| Our educational journeys, however, were very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13083)|
| 3:38:06| Both me and my sister that followed me went through school with undiagnosed ADHD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13086)|
| 3:38:12| The sister after that didn't want to finish high school originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13092)|
| 3:38:15| but then went into an apprentice program after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| Another brother took two extra years to finish high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| and over a decade to finish college and is now serving in the Army here in the States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13101)|
| 3:38:26| and is in South Korea currently, and he found his passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13106)|
| 3:38:29| And then I had a younger brother who didn't finish high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| and then went back to get his GED and now is a successful baker and business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13112)|
| 3:38:38| And all of this to say that every one of us needed something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13118)|
| 3:38:42| In our school system, it doesn't matter what race, it doesn't matter what demographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13122)|
| 3:38:47| each one of our children needs something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| And I really would appreciate the consideration of that as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13130)|
| 3:38:55| I think we can have as many labels as we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| We can disagree on a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| But when we think about the children that we're serving in the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13139)|
| 3:39:03| and the outcomes we want to see, it's truly about what's best for each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13143)|
| 3:39:07| And regardless of where that is, we want to meet them there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13147)|
| 3:39:10| and we want them to be happy and healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13150)|
| 3:39:12| and we want them to be financially independent so they can give back to our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13152)|
| 3:39:16| so that they can then hopefully someday take care of us when we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| As I was reading the document that you decided to push forward and discuss further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13160)|
| 3:39:28| something that really spoke to me, hit home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13168)|
| 3:39:30| was that Knox County School Board of Education recognizes that our students, staff, stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13170)|
| 3:39:35| bring their personal backgrounds and experiences to our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13175)|
| 3:39:39| The district embraces diversity and strives to assure that each student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13179)|
| 3:39:42| regardless of race, ethnic background, and economic conditions, status, or other uniqueness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13182)|
| 3:39:48| receives learning experiences that expands opportunities for growth, advancement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13188)|
| 3:39:53| and higher levels of achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| And I hope that as you move forward, you think of all those children and their unique stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13195)|
| 3:40:00| And I, yeah, thank you very much for your time and for having us here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13200)|
| 3:40:05| Gracias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13205)|
| 3:40:06| Next we'll have Ruby Velasquez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13206)|
| 3:40:09| Ruby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13209)|
| 3:40:13| And after Ruby, we'll have Rosa Mar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13213)|
| 3:40:18| State your name correctly because I know I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| And county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13221)|
| 3:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13222)|
| 3:40:23| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13223)|
| 3:40:24| My name is Ruby Velasquez, Knox County School of Residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| I graduated last spring from Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13227)|
| 3:40:35| And I'm in my first year of college at Maryville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13235)|
| 3:40:39| I came to the United States at the age of eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| I did not know any English whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13242)|
| 3:40:45| And some of the things that made it even more difficult was that I didn't know how the school system was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13245)|
| 3:40:51| nor my parents, which made it even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13251)|
| 3:40:55| But what made it even more was that I went to a predominantly white school with no one that looked like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13255)|
| 3:41:04| or that spoke like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13264)|
| 3:41:06| And what helped me graduate, push me forward to continue my education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| was the support system I had for mentors, counselors, and my family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13270)|
| 3:41:20| When you have a community, it's easier to overcome the things that make you feel scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13280)|
| 3:41:28| I felt scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| Every day I stepped into the school, I felt scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13289)|
| 3:41:33| And I think the equity, sorry, I am nervous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13293)|
| 3:41:41| statement should be pushed because I don't want people like me to face what I faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13301)|
| 3:41:47| I think people like me shouldn't struggle like I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13307)|
| 3:41:51| Because when you struggle, the things that you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13311)|
| 3:41:55| the things that you dream of don't become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13315)|
| 3:41:59| And when you have a community, you have a better environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13319)|
| 3:42:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13326)|
| 3:42:08| Next we'll have Rosa Mar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13328)|
| 3:42:12| Rosa Mar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| Next we'll have Megan Barlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13334)|
| 3:42:19| And after Megan, we'll have Lance McCord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13339)|
| 3:42:29| You have three minutes in county residence, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13351)|
| 3:42:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13352)|
| 3:42:33| My name is Megan Barlet Fogarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| I live in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13354)|
| 3:42:36| Every day I work with Latino youth and families who are working hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13356)|
| 3:42:39| to seek the best educational opportunities for themselves and their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13359)|
| 3:42:43| Education is often listed by those parents as their top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13363)|
| 3:42:47| At the same time, it's often difficult for these parents to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13367)|
| 3:42:50| with their children's schools and teachers due to language barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13370)|
| 3:42:53| and cultural differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13373)|
| 3:42:55| When I started in my position five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13375)|
| 3:42:58| I spent a lot of my time convincing school administrators and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13378)|
| 3:43:01| that the Latino population of students was growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13381)|
| 3:43:04| needed to be acknowledged and planned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| This year, in 2022, Latino students make up nearly 12% of the student population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13387)|
| 3:43:12| in Knox County schools, and I have to spend a little less time convincing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13392)|
| 3:43:16| that this is a population that we need to plan for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13396)|
| 3:43:19| But while I've seen great strides in this time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13399)|
| 3:43:23| trying to meet some of the students and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13403)|
| 3:43:25| I'm very encouraged by the progress that we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| Six months ago, I was asked to be part of the school culture team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| for the Alliance for Educational Equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| which grew out of the Disparities in Educational Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13413)|
| 3:43:37| I've greatly enjoyed working with the school culture team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13417)|
| 3:43:40| including Director of School Culture Janice Cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13420)|
| 3:43:42| school board member Daniel Watson, other community members and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13422)|
| 3:43:45| who are passionate about improving the environment for all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13425)|
| 3:43:48| in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13428)|
| 3:43:50| It's truly been enjoyable and eye-opening to see the amazing programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13430)|
| 3:43:53| and progress that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13433)|
| 3:43:56| However, all the excitement I have for the new programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| communication strategies, and crucially needed plans to diversify the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13438)|
| 3:44:02| and teachers of Knox County schools is being undermined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| by the reluctance of this body to lay a strong foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13445)|
| 3:44:08| and take a stance publicly for their authentic commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13448)|
| 3:44:12| to being a welcoming district for all students, families, and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13452)|
| 3:44:16| Recently, Superintendent Bob Thomas sent an email to all Knox County families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13456)|
| 3:44:21| and he wrote, the diversity of our school communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13461)|
| 3:44:24| is one of the strengths of our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13464)|
| 3:44:26| and we will continue working to build a culture which celebrates that diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13466)|
| 3:44:30| and ensures all our staff, students, and families feel supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13470)|
| 3:44:33| and empowered to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| Those are inspiring words, and I cannot tell you how much it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| for me and my families that I serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13478)|
| 3:44:41| to hear such a strong statement of support coming from our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| It would be very meaningful indeed if the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| also adopted an equity policy which demonstrates to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13488)|
| 3:44:52| that our leadership is a united front that stands in support of all our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13492)|
| 3:44:57| If the Board is not to support this policy or kick it further down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13497)|
| 3:45:01| and not make real progress on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| it undermines not only the stated vision of our superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13503)|
| 3:45:07| but also the passionate work of all the Knox County staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13507)|
| 3:45:10| and community members who have put in many hours of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| on the equity teams and in this initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13513)|
| 3:45:16| over the past eight years as it's been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13516)|
| 3:45:20| So I know the wording of the policy can be worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13520)|
| 3:45:22| but please take a stance in moving this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13522)|
| 3:45:25| because it means a lot to our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13525)|
| 3:45:28| Next we'll have Lance Nicole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13528)|
| 3:45:34| Please state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13534)|
| 3:45:36| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13536)|
| 3:45:40| My name is Lance Nicole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13540)|
| 3:45:41| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| I just want to say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13543)|
| 3:45:46| There's a lot of people who have said more articulate things than I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| I do want the Board to adopt an equity policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13552)|
| 3:45:57| There's many reasons for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| but I want to lift up the reason is because I want Ms. Henderson's daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| who has dyslexia, to get all the help she needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13564)|
| 3:46:08| To me, this is what equity is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13568)|
| 3:46:10| To me, equity means that every child, wherever they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13570)|
| 3:46:14| we're going to do everything we can to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13574)|
| 3:46:19| And I think that's what we should focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| I think there's a lot of reluctance about, you know, what are the words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13581)|
| 3:46:27| We need to see a statement that says we care about all the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13587)|
| 3:46:31| and we've got a commitment to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13591)|
| 3:46:34| I think what's really the issue here, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13594)|
| 3:46:38| go back and have a discussion about just exactly how you want to word it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13598)|
| 3:46:42| but let's make it clear that that is what we're about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| We want to take care of every child to the best of our ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13605)|
| 3:46:50| including Board Member Henderson's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13610)|
| 3:46:54| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13618)|
| 3:46:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13619)|
| 3:47:00| Next we'll have Vivian Scheich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13620)|
| 3:47:02| Vivian Scheich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13622)|
| 3:47:04| All right, next we have Mary Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13624)|
| 3:47:07| Mary Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13627)|
| 3:47:10| State your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13630)|
| 3:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13634)|
| 3:47:15| My name is Mary McMillan Terry, and I reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13635)|
| 3:47:20| A policy that states this is who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13640)|
| 3:47:23| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13643)|
| 3:47:24| I am the mom of a black son and a white son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13644)|
| 3:47:27| I tell them both every day that I value them, but my voice only goes so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13647)|
| 3:47:33| They have phenomenal teachers who tell them each day that they value them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13653)|
| 3:47:38| but their voices only go so far too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13658)|
| 3:47:41| But your voices, board members, your voices go much further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13661)|
| 3:47:46| And I hope with your voices and your authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13666)|
| 3:47:49| you will approve this robust equity policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13669)|
| 3:47:52| because it will reduce disproportionate expulsion rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13672)|
| 3:47:56| recruit and retain diverse teaching force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13676)|
| 3:47:59| and embed cultural competence awareness in school practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13679)|
| 3:48:05| I advocate for this because there are many people listening to your voices right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13685)|
| 3:48:10| Students like my sons are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13690)|
| 3:48:13| students of various racial and ethnic backgrounds and economic statuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13693)|
| 3:48:18| They are listening and hoping your voices affirm their presence in KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13698)|
| 3:48:23| New teachers are listening too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13703)|
| 3:48:26| New teachers who are looking for school systems to teach in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13706)|
| 3:48:29| Some teachers who look like my oldest son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13709)|
| 3:48:32| and for a black son to have a black teacher before the third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13712)|
| 3:48:36| that representation, that diversification and leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13716)|
| 3:48:40| increases that child's chances to enroll in college by 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13720)|
| 3:48:44| And if my son has two black teachers before third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| it increases his chances of enrolling in college by 32%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13727)|
| 3:48:51| That's phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| Teachers who look like my sons will hear your voices affirm this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13733)|
| 3:48:57| and they will know who you are proud to teach and employ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13737)|
| 3:49:01| And you know who else will hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| Students who look like my youngest son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| You have the opportunity to teach them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13745)|
| 3:49:08| what affirming differences and uniqueness looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13748)|
| 3:49:11| When you approve this equity statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| those students will know, because they're already seeing in their schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13753)|
| 3:49:16| and I'm going to get to that in one minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13756)|
| 3:49:20| that all cultures and languages and races are welcome in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| Finally, it's my faith that brings me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13764)|
| 3:49:27| I recognize that everyone doesn't have a particular faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13767)|
| 3:49:31| but I wondered whether we can all agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| that all people have inherent value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| and that sometimes we fail to convey that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13775)|
| 3:49:38| as disproportionate suspension and expulsion rates prove in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13778)|
| 3:49:42| This inequity reminds me of another inequity in the Book of Acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13782)|
| 3:49:46| When the apostles recognized that there was suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13786)|
| 3:49:50| because of inequitable treatment, they listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13790)|
| 3:49:55| They recognized their responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13795)|
| 3:49:58| and they changed the leadership to reduce the suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13798)|
| 3:50:03| Right now, School Culture Department is doing excellent work in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13803)|
| 3:50:08| and I hope that you will affirm that by validating a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| Thank you. Next we have Amy Figg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13815)|
| 3:50:20| All right. Next we have Michael O'Malley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13820)|
| 3:50:25| Michael, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| State your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13827)|
| 3:50:30| Thanks. I'm Michael O'Malley, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13830)|
| 3:50:32| This is my county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13832)|
| 3:50:35| I came here to talk about the equity policy like everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13835)|
| 3:50:39| but since it seems like you guys are interested in moving that back to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13839)|
| 3:50:43| I'm kind of throwing out my notes here and going impromptu, so I hope that's not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13843)|
| 3:50:47| I don't really have a problem with refining the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| That sounds like a good idea if people think that it truly needs refining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13849)|
| 3:50:53| However, I do have concerns that that is actually a request made in good faith, and for these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13853)|
| 3:50:59| One of the board members tonight objected to the current policy based on language that's no longer in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13859)|
| 3:51:05| Another of the board members indicated that they would not vote for the policy no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13865)|
| 3:51:09| because they didn't think it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| Another board member indicated that they felt bullied by public input over e-mail regarding this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13871)|
| 3:51:17| It seems odd of an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13877)|
| 3:51:21| Several others seem to indicate that they haven't kept up with what the Disparities in Education Task Force has to say about this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13881)|
| 3:51:28| since they've been working for years and filled in quite a bit of the gaps in knowledge that people were objecting to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13888)|
| 3:51:35| That was the board's own task force, right, or at least the district's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13895)|
| 3:51:40| It just doesn't seem like people on this board have truly done the reading, truly wanted to engage with this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13900)|
| 3:51:47| because they should have known the answers to the questions that they were asking to delay it to policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13907)|
| 3:51:53| Perhaps I'm wrong, and we'll see a wonderful policy review discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13913)|
| 3:51:57| I really hope to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13917)|
| 3:51:59| But I will also point out the last policy review wasn't actually recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13919)|
| 3:52:02| so it's really difficult for the public to actually decide if there was good faith engagement with the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13922)|
| 3:52:07| if something like that happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13927)|
| 3:52:11| I've seen this happen before with policies where under technicalities, policies are kicked forward in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13931)|
| 3:52:20| and again, procedural safeguards are good, but sometimes it really does feel like an obstruction under just the guise of diplomacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13940)|
| 3:52:32| One thing that worries me that people said multiple times in this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13952)|
| 3:52:37| is that this policy could perhaps lead to more questions or things decided in courts of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13957)|
| 3:52:43| and I say that, like, if we made a policy that says that it strives to assure that each student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13963)|
| 3:52:48| regardless of racial or ethnic background or economic status or other uniqueness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13968)|
| 3:52:52| receive learning experiences and support that expands opportunities for growth, advancement, and high levels of achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13972)|
| 3:52:59| if that policy causes our district to have lawsuits or causes further questions about how we do things in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13979)|
| 3:53:06| that seems to indicate that there are problems in Knox County that need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13986)|
| 3:53:10| because those things, making sure that students of economic disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13990)|
| 3:53:15| or students of different racial or ethnic backgrounds get equal and equitable education access and opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=13995)|
| 3:53:25| I think we would all like to say that that's uncontroversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14005)|
| 3:53:28| and I really hope that that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14008)|
| 3:53:31| Next we'll have Susan Dalton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| Susan Dalton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14013)|
| 3:53:36| And after Susan, we'll have Ty Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14016)|
| 3:53:44| State your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14029)|
| 3:53:50| My name is Dr. Susan Dalton, and I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14030)|
| 3:53:54| I stand before you as an educator who previously taught in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14034)|
| 3:53:58| and now works in a community service organization in the heart of Knoxville serving inner city students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14038)|
| 3:54:04| I'll never forget the day that an eighth grade student stood on the other side of my desk with tears in her eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14044)|
| 3:54:09| asking me the question, why does everyone hate me because of where I come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14049)|
| 3:54:14| You see, she was an Iraqi refugee who had only been in the country just a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14054)|
| 3:54:19| and everyone had spent time picking on her because of what she wore and where she was born| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14059)|
| 3:54:25| and less time getting to know who she was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| I didn't have answers to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14068)|
| 3:54:30| Some questions may just not have answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| but what I could tell her is with 100% confidence that I supported her for who she was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14073)|
| 3:54:39| what she brought, and everything that she was going to become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14079)|
| 3:54:43| and as her teacher, I was going to stand behind her 100% along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14083)|
| 3:54:48| as she learned that for herself, and she educated others in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14088)|
| 3:54:53| To me, this equity of education policy does the exact same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14093)|
| 3:54:58| but instead of it coming from the words of her teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| it is now coming from the words of the governing board of the school district itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14100)|
| 3:55:05| You see, often we hear in education, someone has already mentioned that all means all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14105)|
| 3:55:11| but I can tell you from my experiences that is not always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14111)|
| 3:55:16| Students need to know that they all bring value because of who they are and where they come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14116)|
| 3:55:23| and that all students need the complete support around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14123)|
| 3:55:27| to ensure that they have every opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14127)|
| 3:55:32| during their time in Knox County Schools, but beyond that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14132)|
| 3:55:37| All students deserve to know that you as the governing board of our school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14137)|
| 3:55:41| support them and all that they have both now and to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14141)|
| 3:55:47| Over the years, many initiatives have been set into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14147)|
| 3:55:50| but there is nothing that's centrally been documented to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14150)|
| 3:55:54| that there is protection and provision for all students, especially those in minority status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14154)|
| 3:55:59| This equity policy does just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14159)|
| 3:56:03| Passing this policy is a step in helping to show that it is true in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14163)|
| 3:56:08| that all really does mean all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14168)|
| 3:56:10| It sets a measure of accountability in place to ensure all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14170)|
| 3:56:14| regardless of any factor, are receiving the same opportunities afforded to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14174)|
| 3:56:20| It is my sincere hope that you recognize and agree with the seven outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14180)|
| 3:56:24| in this policy to eliminate disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14184)|
| 3:56:27| The only way to accomplish these goals is a commitment to utilize resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| across the district in a way to support the needs of the diverse students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14190)|
| 3:56:34| and communities that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14194)|
| 3:56:36| This commitment must go beyond verbal discussions and committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14196)|
| 3:56:40| and be identified through policies and procedures that directly support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| The equity in education policy needs to become the pillar and standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14204)|
| 3:56:48| by which all really does mean all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14208)|
| 3:56:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14213)|
| 3:56:54| Next we'll have Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14214)|
| 3:56:55| Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14215)|
| 3:56:58| And after Todd, we'll have Kerion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14218)|
| 3:57:08| Don't start yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14228)|
| 3:57:11| Todd, you've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14231)|
| 3:57:14| You'll have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14234)|
| 3:57:18| Todd Shelton from south Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14238)|
| 3:57:22| He's my board rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14242)|
| 3:57:26| I think it is a very good thing that the superintendent suggested current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14246)|
| 3:57:30| strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14250)|
| 3:57:32| We just do not have a policy naming it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14252)|
| 3:57:35| Our Tennessee Department of Education partnered with other groups to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14255)|
| 3:57:39| the Tennessee Equity Leaders Playbook in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14259)|
| 3:57:45| This C-260 policy of equity is consistent with our state publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14265)|
| 3:57:53| I understand that there are some folks who do not favor such a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14273)|
| 3:57:59| and I think it's that they do not realize that it is meant and applies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14279)|
| 3:58:05| every student in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14285)|
| 3:58:09| There's equality and there's equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14289)|
| 3:58:13| Equality means that each individual or group of people is given the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14293)|
| 3:58:18| resources or opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14298)|
| 3:58:21| Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and works to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14301)|
| 3:58:28| allocate resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14308)|
| 3:58:36| It doesn't refer to people by race, gender, culture, IQ, special needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14316)|
| 3:58:45| income brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14325)|
| 3:58:47| It is because this policy is meant for the whole spectrum of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14327)|
| 3:58:54| It seems to me that if people in our county understood the meaning of equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14334)|
| 3:59:01| that all the families and students could feel a little more some degree of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14341)|
| 3:59:07| comfort knowing that their child is going to be approached in a positive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14347)|
| 3:59:13| and to accomplish the child's goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14353)|
| 3:59:16| I've heard that some people think that we should wait on this until the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14356)|
| 3:59:21| superintendent comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14361)|
| 3:59:23| That's a sad thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14363)|
| 3:59:26| This is the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14366)|
| 3:59:29| We've been working on equity for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14369)|
| 3:59:32| We need a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14372)|
| 3:59:36| The board decision comes from board members after hearing from their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14376)|
| 3:59:40| residents in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14380)|
| 3:59:42| The new superintendent will then have to follow those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14382)|
| 3:59:47| More and more school systems have recognized the need to speak about equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14387)|
| 3:59:53| and to implement policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14393)|
| 3:59:56| The KCS system has taken on equity more and more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14396)|
| 3:59:59| and the board needs to make a policy and statement that gives teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14399)|
| 4:00:02| and staff guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| We need to know from the board when they are going to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14404)|
| 4:00:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| All right, next we'll have to carry on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| Darko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14413)|
| 4:00:22| You have Stacey County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14422)|
| 4:00:23| You have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| Hi, my name is Kieran Darko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14425)|
| 4:00:27| I live at West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14427)|
| 4:00:28| I'm on the football team and an IB full diploma candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14428)|
| 4:00:32| And I'm also active in Scout Troop 147 and a National Achievers Society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14432)|
| 4:00:37| scholar here at the Knoxville Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14437)|
| 4:00:40| Although I've been involved with a lot of different programs at West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14440)|
| 4:00:44| one of the most meaningful has been during the last year when I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14444)|
| 4:00:48| attending the POC club led by the amazing Miss Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14448)|
| 4:00:52| Shout out, Miss Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14452)|
| 4:00:54| POC officially stands for People of Change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14454)|
| 4:00:57| and we've done lots of volunteer work at places like CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14457)|
| 4:01:00| But it's also specifically a place for students of color to feel like they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14460)|
| 4:01:04| have a place where they can be themselves in an environment that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14464)|
| 4:01:08| often feel alienating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14468)|
| 4:01:11| Even though West is relatively diverse compared to the rest of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14471)|
| 4:01:17| I am one of only about two or three students of color, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14477)|
| 4:01:22| in all of my honors and IB classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14482)|
| 4:01:26| A lot of time this can feel really isolating to me as a minority student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| I feel like if the school board can adopt an equity policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14491)|
| 4:01:36| this would make a commitment to encourage more underrepresented students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14496)|
| 4:01:41| like me to take higher level classes that will better prepare them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14501)|
| 4:01:45| their futures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| I hope that me sharing my story helps you all to understand how this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14507)|
| 4:01:51| can be very meaningful for thousands of current and future high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14511)|
| 4:01:56| students in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14516)|
| 4:01:58| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=14518)|
