| 0:01:17| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Anybody who is going to testify before the board today, I need you to stand and raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| Do you swear or affirm the testimony given in this matter shall be the truth, so help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=92)|
| 0:01:35| Our first applicant, the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| This is a deferred application for Thomas Joseph Pitner, MTM's 7712 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=98)|
| 0:01:45| on premises formerly Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Would you please state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| Thomas Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| And Mr. Pitner, this matter has been before the board on several occasions, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| that the last time we deferred it in order to get the information from the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| office, and I'd just like to provide that information to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| Mr. Pitner's application initially came in in February, where he changed his mind as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| to the type of business he intended to run out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Correct me if I'm wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| And reapplied in March of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| At that time, there were some representations made, and the law director's office was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| look into your lease agreement as well as some of the history, criminal history, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| some of the people that were involved in the business or appeared to be involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Yeah, just one gentleman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| And that individual was a Matthew Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| For the board, the information that the law director's office went through was that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| the initial March meeting, Mr. Pitner testified that he leased the property, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| it was on the initial application, from an H.P. Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| We've looked through the documentation, and it appears as if he actually sublets the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=177)|
| 0:03:02| from a Matthew Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Matthew Taylor was the individual who testified at that particular time, and there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| question about his criminal history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| And we were asking for documentation concerning your sublet, what you had sublet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Yes, they wanted a notarized copy of the lease, and we did provide that, I think, about two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| meetings back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Well, they were looking at the document itself is really not legally sufficient that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| provided to us, and based on that, we also pulled, we got a release from Mr. Taylor to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| pull his criminal history to see if he had any particular felony or anything within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| He does have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| He does have a felony, but it's not within the ten-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| And he has other matters that are involved in his criminal record, but nothing that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| in the last ten-year period that would preclude him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| However, the question really remains, as we were looking at the lease agreement, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| testified before the Board that you had leased from Mr. Oxendine, and apparently you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| You leased from Matt Taylor, who sublets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| I think I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| I live in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| When this property become available, I had Matt Taylor require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| In addition, for him taking care of this for me, I said, well, I'll just let you have $1,800| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| a month for taking care of that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| He is a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I had planned on him maybe picking up a few days there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| He's a full-time student now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| If there's a problem with him working there, I don't need him there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| He can just be the landlord of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| And I did mention something the last time, and it slipped my mind until after I had spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| The gentleman that had a beer license in there, Greg Turner, before I went in there, he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| not have a written lease, a notarized lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| He had a verbal month-to-month lease, and he also had a beer license to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| Well, the thing that the law department was looking at, the issue that was before them, was really whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| or not your representations to the beer board were accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| And that's what they were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| That's why they wanted a copy of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| After about six trips, you may say things, and sometimes people can say things where people can twist them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| into other things also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| Well, I had gone back through and we pulled the tapes and we looked at the documentation that you submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| In the March meeting, you stated that you leased from H.P. Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| That's who is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| And there was also testimony from Matthew Taylor, indicating that his involvement was solely on the basis of being a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| bartender a couple of days a week and said that you could fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Based on that, that is the information that the law director's office has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| I do not know if anybody has any questions for Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| I do, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| I spoke with Mr. Pitner earlier today, and Mr. Seymour has been retained by Mr. Pitner to help him with this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| I did not know that until just five minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| In light of that, we all have talked with Mr. Seymour many times up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I think it might be in this board's best interest to give this 30 days more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:29| Let us all have a chance, if we want to, to speak with Mr. Seymour in order that we make sure we get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| So I would like to make a motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| I will still perhaps be on this board at that time, and if so, I can assure you that within that 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:55| I will have what information this board needs to know about regarding Mr. Pitner's operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| Mr. Pitner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| A short form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Yes, sir. I want to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Second, but I'd like to ask Arthur a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I was going to ask him, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Go ahead, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Okay, Arthur, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Fill us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| The beer application itself, the piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Arthur, if you will identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| Oh, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| Let's start back with the original paper application that is filed that initiates the application for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:43| That application asked who is the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Mr. Pitner put down Mr. Oxidine, whom I do not know, but he is the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| according to the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| I went back and watched the videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| I started in January, but actually this first came up in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| So I watched February, March, April, May, and June that dealt with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| Fun weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| But he, I think, really misstated, if you go back and look at that March meeting, what the property ownership situation was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:26| that Oxidine is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| Is it Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Taylor has apparently got a lease from Oxidine and is leasing it to Mr. Pitner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:41| Now, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| The beer laws say that the property owner doesn't have to have a clean record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| The property owner can be anybody, and I, sure, given a little time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| I can come up with a number of people in this town who have less than clean records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| who own property that may have an establishment that sells beer or liquor on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| I have not taken that trouble yet, but that's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| He cannot have anybody have an ownership interest in the business or a work in the business who has been convicted, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=550)|
| 0:09:21| a violation of the beer laws or the laws regulating the service of alcoholic beverages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| or have anybody who has an interest in the business who has been convicted of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| or of a felony involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| Now, our Supreme Court has said, what is a felony involving moral turpitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| They've ruled out two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| There's a sort of funny Supreme Court case from about 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| They said rolling dice for Coca-Cola is not a crime involving moral turpitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| and violation of the game and fish laws is not a crime involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Other than that, they said the lawmakers ought not to use the term moral turpitude in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:10| in any laws that they pass in Nashville because it's not otherwise defined in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| Now, I think Mr. Pitner, in looking at the videos of the meeting, was simply confused when the questions were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:25| Oxidine is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| He addressed that squarely in the application, both applications that are filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| Taylor, he will be renting from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Taylor came to a couple of the meetings and testified, yes, he had a lease from Oxidine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and he was in turn leasing it to Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Now, there is no requirement in the beer laws that you have a formal written lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| that a lawyer such as me would draw to lease the property from Oxidine to Taylor to Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=650)|
| 0:11:02| I could charge him a goodly sum of money to draw such a lease, and a lot of people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| But if you look at a lot of the property arrangements around town, they're on handshakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| They are on the backs of pieces of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| I had one up in Sevier County a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| It was written in two languages, English and Farsi, that involved a lease of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| And the court really had fun trying to interpret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| But you can get into all situations, all sorts of situations, where people don't have any kind of written lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:35| That's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| A lease of property under Tennessee law for more than one year is unenforceable in the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=698)|
| 0:11:46| unless there is, as the statute says, a memorandum in writing of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=706)|
| 0:11:54| It doesn't say it has to be a formal legal document such as you all see quite frequently here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| When Knox County is involved in legal deals, it just has to be a writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| And a writing can be something like what Mr. Pitner and Mr. Taylor and Mr. Oxidine have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| It can be something scratched out on a legal pad here as long as it's signed by the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| That's all that Tennessee law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| It doesn't require that it come off a lawyer's word processor or out of his form file or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| In looking at this, it appears to me that Mr. Pitner is entitled to a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| He has complied with all the requirements of state law and the county regulations that regulate the sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:47| If I have told him and I have told Mr. Taylor that as long as there's a question about whether or not Mr. Taylor has a conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| he cannot work in the place or have any ownership interest in the place, and he understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| I have not met Mr. Taylor, but I did have a phone conversation with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| Was it Friday? Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| And he understands that, and Mr. Pitner understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Mr. Pitner understands the beer laws probably more than he did in March when he first appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| or February when he first appeared before you, but will certainly comply with the laws of the state of Tennessee and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=802)|
| 0:13:32| And I submit he is at this time respectfully entitled to a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=812)|
| 0:13:40| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| This has been going on since February or January when you first came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| I just want to make sure I understood where we were on a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| When you first came to us, there was an issue as to whether or not there would be nudity involved at the club or the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| And you had said, no, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| And so the second thing was Mr. Taylor's involvement with regards to how he was going to interface with your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| So how will Mr. Taylor be involved in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| How will he interact with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| He's going to interact with me as a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| If he cannot be there selling alcohol, he will not have any involvement in alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| If there's any problem with him working in the building whatsoever, he will not be in the building in a working capacity other as a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| Now, as I understand the law director to say that this issue was over ten years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:43| So if it's over ten years old, then that's not something that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Is that correct, law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| If it's ten years old, if it's over ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| He does have a felony that's in excess of ten years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| But according to the law, if it's in excess of ten years, is that a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| So that's not really something for us to consider if it's over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| It was questioned to me about the way I answered his question about a crime involving moral turpitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| And we had had servers training for myself, Mr. Taylor, and some other people that would possibly be selling beer there at the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| And he had to provide a background check and stuff at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| And they did give him his server's card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| I'm ready to give you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I mean, you've been here since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| And the law director now, I think, has brought before us the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| And I respect my colleague asking for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| And if that's what the body wishes, I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| But whether it's next month or this month, I'm prepared to vote to give you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| And I know at one time I've lost track of the meetings now, but it was either the third meeting we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| Everybody seemed to be for it and ready to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| except there was a lady who had to speak on something that everyone sitting up there at that time said was probably a civil matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=957)|
| 0:16:07| And we resolved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And, as a matter of fact, we were just pretty much looking to get our beer license that next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| and then the issue with the lease and so on and so forth until we're here to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| And I had to get Arthur to give me some advice on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| Commissioner Norman, were you through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I just wanted to ask Mr. Roundtree, I gave the second for the delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| but I really don't understand why we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| So I just wanted to ask him what's going on with him about the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| Mr. Pitner, I spoke with you and Mr. Seymour down here earlier before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Would you describe to this board what you explained to me about the attire that your employees are dressed in during your business hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1009)|
| 0:17:02| I've been asked before by the board, do you have any dancing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| No, I do not have any nude type of dancing whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| My girls, if you've ever been to a Hooters restaurant, you're looking at about the same type of attire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:18| Are these uniforms that you furnish for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Actually, we have talked to a costume designer about actually creating us a uniform right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| but I've sort of put that on hold until we see what we do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| because I figured after I get beer I might even go as far as trying to get a food menu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| and get with the health department and do some things like serving a little menu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| and have it sort of like a sports type atmosphere in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Mr. Chairman, I want to make a statement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| I leave this seat in two months, maybe one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| This perhaps could be my last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| And I want to be positive and 100% sure that whatever I turn over to my successor is clean and above reproach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:13| And that's one reason, Commissioner Norman, that I really feel strongly that in 30 days I will know that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:22| I realize it's been going on a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| but I just haven't had the opportunity to dig a little deeper and to know what I found out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| I want to be sure that we're being told the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Tonya, is that all for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I know that it says in here that any knowing false statement made either in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| or in testimony before the beer board shall result in automatic revocation of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| In addition, any person making such false statements should not be eligible to receive a beer permit for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Now, I understand that Mr. Seymour said that there was some confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and I could understand how there could be some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| I understand that we all want to be a thorn in somebody's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| and if they've done everything that they're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| that we want to make sure that they have an opportunity for making their business prosper, especially in these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| What I would like to maybe throw out to all of you to consider is in the form of a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| Tennessee Code Annotated says that the beer board may issue temporary beer permits for periods not to exceed 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| but the applicant for such a permit must meet the same requirements as necessary for a permanent permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| No temporary permit shall allow the sale of beer on publicly held property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| So maybe we should consider using a temporary beer permit for 29 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| and allow this gentleman to move forward and in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| On our part, since we don't know whether we're going to be sitting here or not, this would not thwart his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| It would allow him to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| It would also allow our successors, if they're going to be in our place next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| to follow up on this and have him come back and actually see what he's done in about a month's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| And that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I'm going to go along with my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| This is your district, and if that's what you want to do, I'm going to go along with your wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| But even if you're not here next year, you can still speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, you can still come to this body and tell us what you've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| So not knowing what's going to happen, you can still come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| Madam Law Director, I'm not familiar with the code that Commissioner DeVries just quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| Is that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Which one are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| She was talking about a temporary beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| That's the first time I've heard of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| There is a provision for that in your beer code, in your beer board procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Madam Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I also would like to inform you that on the March 24th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| his application was approved pending review of the law director's office, the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| So there was actually a voting on this on the March 24th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| It's not an application that has not been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| But as part of the board, you do have the right, pursuant to our guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| to withdraw that, rescind it, or modify it in any way that you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Chairman, in the 17 years that I've been here, we have not used a temporary permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:43| It's not in our beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| It is in the state TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But in our beer laws, the city of Knoxville has got a temporary to use around Calhoun's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| We never did use that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Is that or they think in U.K. they're more like special events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Is that what you're talking about around Calhoun's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Ball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Ball games and things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Yes, this question is to Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| I'm having a hard time understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| You said you need a month to check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| But if they're not open, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| He's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Are you open now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| Not selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| We're not selling beer, but we have been open since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| He's selling Coca-Cola.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| So what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Potato chips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Have a pool table, a video game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| When I was by there a while back, there was a sign up, bring your own bottle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| I was by there Saturday night, and there was about seven cars in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| He didn't have a beer license, and I didn't go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| But, yes, he's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| He's never denied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| He's said that in three or four previous meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| Mr. Chairman, I've got a question for the beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| UK, just because Knox County has never utilized a temporary beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:26| what would be wrong with testing the waters and doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| And I'd like to hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Commissioner, I don't have a problem with it if you all want to bring it up and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| The beer laws that we've got out, the beer board met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| and went over the beer laws that you'd use in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and that's what we've been going by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1431)|
| 0:24:04| I've got a motion on the floor, and I think I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| We've got a substitute motion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| We need to vote for the substitute motion or the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| What do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| I mean, you said you didn't have a problem with the 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I'm not trying to give this guy a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I just want to be sure because I don't want to give Brad or Kathy something that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| That's where I'm coming from with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| And we've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| We've heard from the beer inspector about setting a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| opening up the temporary beer permit procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| Mr. Pitner has been here six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| I've not heard anything negative about Mr. Pitner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| but I just want to be sure that what I'm doing for the next generation of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| that are going to be sitting in this chair is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| We've got two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| It's never going to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| We've got two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| You want to postpone it and you want to go ahead and vote for it today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| and give a 30-day or 29-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| I would only want to do that if Commissioner Roundtree would agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| I'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I'll vote for your substitute motion, Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Restate your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| I'd like to make a motion that Knox County Beer Board today will grant Thomas Joseph Pitner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| a temporary beer permit for 29 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:36| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| How many days did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| 29 because we're not supposed to give it in excess of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| It's not to exceed 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Well, we could do 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| It's not to exceed 30 days, so we could do a 30-day temporary beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| You have a 30-day permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I'm sorry it's taken so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| and I hope to do right by the county and run a good, clean place for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| Now, what happens after the 30-day permit expires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Will he have to come back before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| He'll have to come back here next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| He'll come back next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| and I think your beer board meeting next month is the 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| so that will fall within that 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| I will pledge to this board that I'll have more information for each of you at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Commissioner, I would be happy to help you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Can you take me over there with you, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1599)|

| 0:26:42| I'll give you a jar of jelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=1607)|

| 0:34:09| Eighteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:34| commissioners are present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Before we get started on our devotion and pledge of allegiance to the flag, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| to have a short moment of silence for the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2083)|
| 0:34:51| I think we all know what happened yesterday, a sad event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| Would you like to say anything, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| Harmon, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| I just would like to thank this community on behalf of my congregation and remind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| that a lot of healing will come in the next few days and months, and we'll need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| Hate entered our house of worship, but hate will not last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| The good people there will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I just hope that in whatever coverage we give of this today and in the near future, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| spend too much time on those who hate, but on the heroes, Robert Birdwell, Jamie Parkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| John Bostad, Greg McKendry especially, Brian Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| These people took children to safety, tackled a gunman, or in one case, took some shots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| that may have wiped out a row in which I was sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| They are all heroes, and I hope our concentration is on them as we do our moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2155)|
| 0:36:04| Our devotion today will be led by Commissioner Victoria DeFries and the pledge of allegiance to the flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:13| by Commissioner Greg Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| To conclude the devotional today, I have invited Dr. Gary Weedman, who is the current president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| of Johnson Bible College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| So, Dr. Weedman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen of the commission, I'm pleased to be here today in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Before today, all I knew about the Knox County Commission was what I read in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:44| I'm happy to see you firsthand, and I looked at your webpage today to find out more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| I saw an awesome agenda you have today, so I know my job is to be here and be gone in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| I still don't know exactly what you do, but I do know that you are ambassadors for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| citizens of our county, and in some way, I suppose we all serve as ambassadors of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:14| group or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| A few years ago, I learned a little bit about what it means to be an ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| I, for the past 25 years or so, have traveled in Eastern Europe and for a time lived and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| worked there in Eastern Europe, and before the fall of communism, I was going from Romania| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| to Hungary, and I was detained for about 14 hours at the border.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| It was a very difficult crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Before I left, I had, through the intervention of a U.S. senator, had a meeting with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| U.S. ambassador to Romania at the time, and when I left, he gave me his card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| I finally got across the border into Hungary and found a straight and smooth road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| It was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| I was late for an appointment, and I was driving too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| I came into a village, and I jerked awake as I saw a man waving frantically with white| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2280)|
| 0:38:07| sleeves on his arms, and I whizzed by him as he ran with his partner to their police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| I knew I was in trouble if I didn't get back to where he was, so I made a fast U-turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| went back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| He marched over, quite irritated at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I handed him my car papers, my visa, and my passport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| He was rustling through them, chattering away in Hungarian at me, handed his partner my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| passport, and out fell Ambassador Green's card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| He picked it up and said to his angry partner, Ambassador, and the man said, Ambassador,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:50| and he snapped to attention and saluted and put all my papers together and bowed and handed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| them to me and motioned for me to be on my way, and I was on my way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| After I left, I realized I hadn't said one word during that whole encounter, but then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| I realized I was an ambassador, not the kind he thought, but I was an ambassador for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| You are ambassadors, too, and I know that you know that and you act in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| In the Old Testament, it was Israel that was an ambassador of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| In whatever circumstances, Israel was not always treated with the deference that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| ambassadors are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| In fact, Israel, as we know, was taken into captivity, but even when in captivity, Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| was told by one of her prophets to seek the peace and the prosperity of the city to which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| I have carried you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| Wherever you find yourself, this ambassador was told, seek the peace and the prosperity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| of the people around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I think the classic advice to ambassadors is from another Old Testament prophet, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| time Micah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| And Micah asks again of Israel, what does the Lord require of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| And then he answers his own question, to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| with your God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| To act justly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| To treat those people who are in the lower parts of society with respect and with justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:40| In the first five chapters of the prophecy of Micah, he addresses the injustice done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| to those people, physical abuse, illegal confiscation of property, treating people inhumanely for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| financial benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Our task in Knoxville is to find those people on the outskirts of our society and to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| sure that they are treated justly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| To love mercy, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| The Hebrew word is chesed, and it describes a character of God, to love people even when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:19| they are unlovable, to make a commitment to them that is irrevocable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| That's how God treats his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| And then to walk humbly with God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| I'm not sure how else we can walk with God other than humbly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| If we have a sense of his constant presence with us, we walk humbly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| Someone has defined character as what one does when no one is watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| We know that God is always watching and always with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| I don't know a lot about your work, but I do know that you are ambassadors for our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| And as with any ambassador, your job is to seek the peace and the prosperity of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| county, to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| Our hearts indeed do go out to those brave people who did act against evil yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:27| at the Unitarian Universalist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| And our hearts indeed and our prayers on our campus have gone out for those who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| been so tragically affected, and I want to pray for them and for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| Sovereign God, of all the peoples of this earth, you have blessed us with an abundance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| that a majority of this earth's inhabitants could not even dream about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| And for this undeserved blessing, we give you thanks and accept the responsibility of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| being good stewards of what you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I thank you for these men and women who have dedicated themselves to be ambassadors for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2580)|
| 0:43:06| the citizens of our county, and I pray for them in their every deliberation and decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| that they will reflect your character and purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| We do lift up, O Lord, these brave people who acted in the face of evil and hatred so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| courageously and lovingly, extending your own loving kindness to those about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| And we pray at this time that they will find your own peace in their lives and in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=2616)|

| 1:25:52| and obviously these certifications are not something Dennis had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| It's something that he did on his time to make him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5156)|

| 1:27:04| 30 days. Ms. Davis I believe that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| you want to talk about this. Yes sir I do. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5228)|

| 1:27:32| And in speaking with Mr. Nevada| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| train we have a contract with them to do energy audits and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| what I would like to do is defer this for 30 days because I think what we'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| is make sure that we as commission know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| buildings have been audited and what have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| And so we already have a contract to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| basically what I was trying to accomplish was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| to see where we were with regard to our utility costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| and if there was any energy savings that we could utilize or capitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| on to make sure that that was occurring. And so we have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| have a contract with train to do just this what I was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| accomplish with this task force. But I would like some time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| get with Mr. Nevada. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| And just make sure that we know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| I guess defer. Motion to defer. But I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| like to him to speak to exactly what we have done. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| on consent you're going to be doing the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| but you also have done some schools and what else have you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| That's correct and actually I sat through last week's finance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| intergovernmental subcommittee meetings and I decided that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| as a body need some good news. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| fact is that all the citizens of Knox County have a lot to be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| We've got a lot of really neat things happening right here in Knoxville and in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| regarding energy savings and moving toward a more greener society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| Just in short, in 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| Knox County kind of led the way if you will. Put out a very, very expensive RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| I'm proud to say that train was the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| publisher of that RFQ. Since that time we've been engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| with 10 school pilot that we're 6 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5364)|

| 1:29:32| ahead of energy savings to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| I think the school system is watching the M&V| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| data come in as that project rolls along and we're hopeful and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| that they will authorize us to proceed with additional schools here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| within the next couple of months. We're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| proceeding with the sheriff's facilities, the Maloneyville Road facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| after tonight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| that will be a very detailed and extensive audit and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| believe, thanks to you Commissioner Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| and the conversations last week, I believe the county is in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| of issuing us a letter to proceed on the remainder of the county facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| Just a brief recap, this all goes back to the RFQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| that Purchasing put out in 2005. It's very, very stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| There was conversation in the finance subcommittee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| The audits for the remainder of the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| there's no cost to the county. These are preliminary audits where we go in with a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| do the energy and envelope evaluations and then come back, present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| our findings and proceed down a very concise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| path and in a nutshell, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| some of you will remember the presentation that we did to the commission in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| of last year for the schools. Simply stated, everything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| takes place must completely pay for itself based on energy savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| Each year is compartmentized so each year of the term of contract has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| stand on its own. There's a hard audit and reconciliation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| if we miss a year, train writes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| a check, plain and simple. And we're not allowed to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| if we have a year where there's excess savings, we're not allowed to roll those into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| a year of deficit savings. Every year has to stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| And I think you may have helped and passed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| a little brief that I put together. There's a lot of really good stuff and there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| a lot of good activity with the school system. So I think I'll just open it up if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| any questions. But do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| Motion to defer for 30 days. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| Are there any other questions? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Seeing none, all in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| Opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| Next we'll go to 907 on page 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| Resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| 907 is approving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| purchase and lease of the building known as the Family Investment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| Intergovernmental? Voted 9-0 with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| recommendation. Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| Second. Property moved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| Okay. Commissioner Moore. Okay. Is there someone here who can answer some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| I think you were working on some information we asked for last time about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| leases and how much and who's going to be occupying the rest of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| And I think their board is here. We asked their board to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| and answer those questions. As we said, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| transferring a building back to Knox County. But we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| responsible for the upkeep and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| from whatever date we take possession of it as ownership from here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| out. So the taxpayers in Knox County are going to be upkeeping this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| That's correct. And I see on one of the exhibits, it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| one of the leases is $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| To Knoxville Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Development Corporation. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| I'm going to pass it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| I think that would be KCDC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| they have a housing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| in that location. We also brought the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Roy Mullins through two weeks ago to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| space in there that we might use. But basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| we're passing out a piece of paper now that tells the tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| what they're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| What's the total rent of the whole building with all the tenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| I'm not sure of that total rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| Is there something you can get us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| I think this may help cover that total rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| It would be helpful. We had this information prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| sitting up here getting ready to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| How many city residents use this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| versus how many city residents use this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| I can answer that because every city resident is a county resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| so every resident that uses it is a county resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| Is there more citizens coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| Can I answer this and then I'll turn it over to the board. When a battered woman comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| we don't ask her zip code whether she's a city or a county resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| The board is here to speak to their program. If you have questions about their program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| we're going to answer them. If this commission votes to throw them out we'll find them a new home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| I don't think we want to throw anybody out but we want to make sure to the taxpayers in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| that we don't take over a facility and have to pay all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| money when we're going to get two dollars back in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| We've got to have some business sense in trying to run this government and I don't think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| invest whatever it's going to cost us in operation to come back with ten dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| a month in rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| Who's going to be here from the board? Who can answer some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| about how much total rent's going to be taken in? How many square foot's in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| What's the lease amount per square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| We'll ask their board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| if they want to speak about the program. But I guess the point is that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| Knox County building that we went out and got federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| to renovate and federal money has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| greatly renovated that building. KCDC, when they let the building go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| since that was originally a Knox County building, they had no other choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| to give it back to us. That's the way the original deed restriction was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| When they gave it to KCDC they put several million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| in renovations of federal money then it comes back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| How many members are on the Family Justice Center from the county and how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| people are from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| We'll ask their board to respond to their board make up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| We need somebody from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5780)|
| 1:36:36| Yes sir. I'm Amy Dilworth with the Executive Director of the Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| at 400 Harriet Tubman. Okay, you're the Executive Director. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| board members here that can speak to this? Yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| You take direction from the board, I guess. Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| Is the chairman of the board here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5812)|
| 1:37:00| I guess the first question is, Chief Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| are you the chairman of the board? I am. Okay, how many city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| people represent the board and how many county residents represent the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| I don't know the city and county resident make up. I know the county mayor is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| the board, the city mayor is on the board, the sheriff is on the board, the chief of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| is on the board. We have-Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| Randy Nichols is on the board, General Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| Dave Yoder is on the board. And who is Dave? Where does he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| fit into the picture? I mean, his occupation? I don't know where he lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| but he-No, I mean, what's his occupation? Legal aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| Then we have some members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| Leroy Thompson, Mickey Maloney is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| the board as a member of the community. Jim Velna with the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| Jim Velna with the zoo. Okay, do you know what districts they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| represent? No, we'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| ask them what districts they're from. I think Mr. Thompson may be close to your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| I don't know. Chief, could you give your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| and address for the record, please? Sterling 01800 Howard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Baker Boulevard. Okay, I guess, Chief, what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| I've got a sheet here with city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| county districts in here, but it's hard to tell because I know part of my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| is inside the city limits in Knoxville. So it's hard to tell how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| city residents come to Family Justice and how many county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| I mean, we can argue the fact that everybody, even if you live inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| you pay county taxes. But if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| like the jails, I would say probably 75% of the people that's incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| probably come from inside the city. So it kind of drains the county taxpayer, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| another issue. What's the Family Justice Center going to be paying rent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| county and how many square feet are you going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| have? I don't know. Do you know how many square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| I don't know the exact square footage, but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| a large percentage of the building. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| all of the third floor and it is the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| of the second floor. Okay, we've got something that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| handed out, maybe 6200 square feet. That sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| The usable is 5500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| and it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| Family Justice Center is about, oh excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| there's 24,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| 24,500 square feet total in the building and the Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Justice Center would occupy 5000. Okay, how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| is your board or whoever pays rent, how much is the rent going to be paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| There is no rent at this time for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| Family Justice Center. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| Now you asked a question earlier about who uses the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| and the way we break it out by clientele| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| is by zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| So now we could say, and you already have, we could say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| everybody who's on a zip code is in the county, which is accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| but we do not distinguish whether it's a county address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| versus a city address, but they're all Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| citizens is how we break it out. Could you all start doing that in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Find out if they're city or county residents? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| I was looking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| Oh, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| I guess, I don't know who can answer, who's going to be running the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| I mean, if we could get a total of revenue, who would we ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| Who's going to be over the building? County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| PBA on behalf of the county. Yeah, maintenance is through PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| Okay. So maybe I'm done with you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| I appreciate the job you do. I know battered women and places, we need a place for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| to be able to go and do a one-stop shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| It's just trying to make it financial decisions, but if you could keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| county and city residents for future use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| I'd appreciate it. Thank you. And I think, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| we have a long agenda today, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| to get into a prolonged debate on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| we add up when we all are Knox County citizens, I don't think it's a productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| conversation to have. It's almost as unproductive as asking how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| many people from the city use the city county building and the people from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| county use the city county building. So if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| in order, I'd like to call for the question. Mr. Chairman, I think I still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| the floor. I thought you had relinquished it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| No, I said I was done with these folks right here, and I appreciate your service, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| think I was asking a question of how much tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| revenue we're going to receive from KCDC, DCS, the sheriffs and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| legal aid, district attorney, the Family Justice Center, senior aid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| and the auditorium. All I've seen is a lease for $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| And if someone can answer that, I'll get on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| ready to vote, but I can't vote on something I don't know how much we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| I can tell you that for the police department and the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| who maintain space over there to service those who come over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| from being battered women, we do not pay a lease on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| that. We have provided the city, talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| has provided a substantial sum of money toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| getting the center up and running. I don't know if you have those figures or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| but essentially last year alone, approximately $165,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| out of city services and or personnel and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| I know that's not addressing what you're asking, but the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| and the county do contribute to this through the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| department and the police department as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| I guess, Mike Arms, how much has the county contributed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| toward this facility or any programs ran by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| the county? The county's contribution is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| the maintenance of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| I want to be brief on this answer. Randy Nichols, attorney general, came to us and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| we would like to have a program for battered women. We sat down with our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| enforcement from both city and county and they both agreed. We went into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| as a team effort, so when the battered women come in, it is a one-stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| shop. I think Chief Owens gave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| same answer that our sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| will give, is that they're not going to pay rent to go into a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| to help these people. It's a public service just like our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| health department. We're not asking people who come into our health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| to pay an admission fee. So this is a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| that our judicial, both our law enforcement and our attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| ask us to help set up. We had a building that was unused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| just like South Knoxville School is unused. We got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| federal grant to fix that building up. It's a first-class building now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| This is a program that our attorney general and sheriff and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| chief all support. I don't think anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| assigned Knox County's mayor's office role is to go out and collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| rent and start charging fees for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| If it does, we'll move them out and we'll just sell that building. I'm sure someone will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| buy it. So this is either a program we're going to support or we're not going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| But we're not going to be in the business of being landlords and lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| agents for a program like this. So the questions you're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| might be legitimate questions. I don't have the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Okay, Mr. Arms. The only question I'm asking, you told me last month that we were going to be getting rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| And I know KCDC, is that part of the battered women program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| Is the auditorium, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| 5,100 square foot, is that part of the battered women program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:34| Are you done, Mr. Arms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| Does anybody else can answer any questions from the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:50| Do you have a question, Commissioner Davis? Yes, I do. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| Chairman. In intergovernmental, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| earlier, I believe John Troyer, I had asked you this question with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| to, Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| the only unit code we have for Family Justice Center is 133.62| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| and the only cost associated with this is contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| with other, which is PBA. And that is $169,620.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| And my question was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| that I had asked Mr. Troyer to speak to PBA about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| was since we are contracting services for the libraries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| and the health departments and those contracted services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| added up to over a half a million dollars that PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| is not going to have, they're not going to have that cost, that I didn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| like that we needed to pay PBA that $169,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| because we have removed that expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| from PBA with regard to janitorial services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| and lawn maintenance. And Mr. Troyer, have you spoken to PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| We have a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| from PBA here and PBA is not charging us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| for things that we're contracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| outside separately, the custodial services, the lawn maintenance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| PBA is not charging us for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| We have asked PBA to manage the Family Investment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| It is in the budget. I think the short answer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| I think the sheet that you have out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| that was handed out today includes $98,000 of rent that will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| offset the charges from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| Yes, I understand that they shouldn't be charging us for services that we have contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| with other people, but they also had stated that they were not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| to lower their budget at all since we had removed those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| And so my question is why would we be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| an additional cost when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| have removed a half a million dollars of costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| associated to your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| Ms. Davis, I think you misheard me in our previous discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| What I said was that our overhead costs would not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| In fact, Mr. Troyer removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| well over $800,000 from our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| for the grounds and custodial window cleaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| related services. And so our budget was reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| to make up for what you guys just bid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| Although I think that if the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| that we have heard are right, you will be paying about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| $70,000 or $80,000 more to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| But that is your call. In this case, though, our budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| in fact were reduced. So what you heard me say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| was that our overhead costs wouldn't change. The contract costs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| all those services that you're now doing were all removed from our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| But you stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| your overhead would not be removed. And so those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| costs associated with regard to your employees performing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| those services, we are still paying those employees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| they are not performing those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Our overhead costs are not employees out maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| buildings. Okay, but you had stated earlier that the reason for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| some of the higher price in per square footage had to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| minimum wage increases. And I'm sorry, but minimum wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| is associated with employees. Yes, and what I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| was that the minimum wage impacts impacted the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| of our contracts for things like custodial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| lawn care, etc. That's where minimum wage impacts. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| my employees. I don't think you've got any employees in making minimum wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| and I don't believe I do either. So I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| you're not hearing what I'm saying. Our overhead costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| are our finance department, my office with three people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| and two MIS people. We covered that in that briefing that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| prepared for you about four or five weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| By you taking out what were all contracted services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| how would you think that would change our overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| costs? I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| Do you have anything else? Because we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| I just don't understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| the oversight would not decrease. And that's where I don't, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| guess that I'm confused. And I just, I don't agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| charging rent for the family justice center because, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| for the people in the family justice center, because that was the whole carrot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| to have everyone there in that building was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| so that they would have a rent-free place. Their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| infrastructure would be provided. So that was the draw to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| get all of these people together so that we could care for these women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| And so we're actually doing, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| against the initial plan of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| purpose of the family justice center. And by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| charging some of these folks rent, I have a feeling that they don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| especially since community grants have been diminished, especially since a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| of people don't have a lot of disposable income to donate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| and give to charitable institutions, so their budgets are cut. They don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| have the resources to pay rent. And that's why we were, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| whole point and purpose of it was to provide that infrastructure for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| groups to accommodate these battered women so they wouldn't be driving around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| so that they could come and be taken care of in one place. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| I don't agree with charging rent for any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| community service agencies that are going to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| And I would hope that you would lower your costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| I'm doing in that building, like in all your buildings, what I'm asked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| what I'm told to do. Nobody's making any effort to collect rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| from the family justice center. They were paying rent for the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| couple of years. They had a federal grant and they were paying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| from that federal grant. They were paying it to KCDC. When the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| ran out and they were unable to pay rent, it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| that was the motivation for KCDC to then give you the building back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| The entities that are paying rent, KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| and this is really ultimately between them and John Troyer, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| I understand that KCDC are paying the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| operating costs, in essence our costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| for the square footage they occupy. And KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| has their section 8 housing organization in that little building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| to the left. It's almost like an attached but separate building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| The other entity that will be paying rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| would be DCS, a state agency, obviously Department of Children's Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| The number that they will pay in rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| is not yet solidified. We're estimating around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| $1250 to $13 a foot. That's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| $6.5 to $7 more per foot than the operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| costs are. But that lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| is still not finished. It's in Nashville in the hands of DCS' attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| So your obligation, if you will, your cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| if that lease gets solidified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| and if KCDC pays their share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| of their operating costs, your cost would be about $61,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| Closer to $61,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| Of the $169,620| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| that we have. That was last year. You're reading last year's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:03| No, I'm looking at the budget that we just approved. Well, I didn't put your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| together, so I don't know what's in it. I know what our budget for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| building's operation was $61,300. Now there is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| a build-out cost associated with DCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| So once that lease is done, I want to say there's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| a $300,000 build-out cost for their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| Obviously you've got to look at the rent versus that build-out cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| bonded. But I don't know where you're getting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| The $169,000 number was our 08 budget because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| there was no rental income in that budget. In the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| 08 budget. Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| I guess, I don't know whether my original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| motion was improper or failed for lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| a second, but let me first say I think people are getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| The part of it that Randy Nichols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| is the Family Justice Center. The building is the Family Investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| Center. The building is more than a family justice piece of it. And it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| that is, Commissioner Davis, tax-free and is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| people want it to do. But I guess with that, I would again like to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| for the question so that we can move our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| I'll probably move to second for the call for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| question. Starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| Aye. Commissioner Strickland? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| Commissioner Mark Harmon? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| Commissioner Campin? Aye. Commissioner Norman? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| Commissioner Ivan Harmon? No. Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| No. Commissioner Daniels? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Commissioner Hammond? Yes. Commissioner Leuthold? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| Commissioner Briggs? Yes. Commissioner Roundtree? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| Commissioner Lambert? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Commissioner Smith? No. Commissioner Moore? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| Commissioner Ballard? Yes. Commissioner Wright? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| Commissioner DeVries? Yes. Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:31| The call passes 13 yes, 6 no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| We have a motion on the floor to approve. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| I have a quick comment. Is that appropriate? I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| My light's been on quite a while. Can you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| I'm a question. My light's been on before the call for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| question. My call actually predated. We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| on the floor. All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| One no. And I'm not against the program, but I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| vote on something we don't have the answers to. Two no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| I'm for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| How many no's? Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Do we have a pass? On the motion. Are there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| passes? Motion passes 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| yes, two no's and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| We're back to 4-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| Everybody else got their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:43| What are we on now, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| 4-0-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| resolution approving the mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| settlement agreement between Knox County and Natural Resource Recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| Voted 9-0 with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:15| We don't have a motion, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| Bruce? Mr. Chairman, I would request that Rob McConkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| with Knox County Law Director's Office and also Dean Farmer hired outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| counsel with Knox County Law Director's Office go ahead and address the mediated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| 4-0-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| This is going to be a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you. Commission has heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| a lot about this proposed settlement in committees and I've addressed you extensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| in committees and also prepared a memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| that was included in your packets with some materials that Commissioner Davis had requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| So I'm going to try to be brief. I want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| real quickly about what is before you and what is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| The question before you is whether the county should settle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| existing contract disputes with its contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee, on the terms that were proposed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| the proposed mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| And by doing that, avoid the costs and risks of litigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| those claims. This consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| does not involve the false claims lawsuit that was filed by Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| Those claims have been extensively investigated and evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| by the county's counsel, Mr. Farmer, and he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| The county's counsel has determined that the likelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| of success in a false claims lawsuit is minimal at best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| and we agree and have asked the court on that basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| to dismiss the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| And that holds true regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| of what you do today with regard to the proposed mediated settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| They're two separate issues. What we are proposing to settle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| is a contract dispute, possible breach of contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| claims that have not been asserted yet in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| What is in litigation are false claims allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| Two separate issues. This also should not be a referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| on Natural Resources Recovery's performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| under the contract. To this point, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| receipt and processing of biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| has been highly regulated by TDEC and the Environmental Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| Agency. Those agencies regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| and routinely monitor and evaluate the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| and to this point have never taken any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| enforcement action against the county's permit based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| testing of the materials out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| That monitoring and evaluation and regulation will continue in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| The safety of the materials is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| regulatory matter. It's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| and again, what this is, what's before you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| a proposed resolution of breach of contract claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| It's clear that neither Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| have performed as strictly required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| by the terms of the contract. The county's most viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| claim for breach of contract would be the failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| of the contractor to pay revenue sharing as required by the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| Those amounts are disputed as I've detailed in the memo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| that's in your packets. At a minimum, it appears that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| what the county would have been owed had revenue sharing been enforced as required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| would have been $125,000 on the order of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| Under other interpretations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| and depending on whether you included additional products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| as proposed by Mr. Mays, that number could go as high as about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| $300,000. On the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| on the other side of the equation, Natural Resources Recovery has potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| breach of contract claims against the county as well. Their most viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| claims for breach are based on the county's failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| to upgrade and permit the forks of the river site as called for by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| the contract and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| the expansion of the concrete pad at the Solway that was never performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| They have alleged, and in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:51| to those two theories for breach, they've outlined a few other theories for breach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| that frankly we don't evaluate as being quite as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| strong. But those two points as counsel for the county give me some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:03| heartburn and I believe the county has potential exposure on those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| In any event, Natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| Resources Recovery has outlined their potential claims and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| estimates that their, asserts that their damages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| if they litigate them would be in the neighborhood of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| $1.6 million for lost profits and for expenses incurred as a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| the county's shortcomings in performance under the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| We might disagree with that if we had to go litigate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| them. I'm sure we would raise some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| I could come up with some strong defenses for that. But as a practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| reality, if you set that aside, set aside the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| of what are their damages, as a practical matter, what would the cost to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| be to cure its performance issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| and to actually, in other words, if the county went out and upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| and expanded and permitted the forks of the river site and went out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| expanded the pad at Solway as it had originally planned to do, what would the cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| the county be? And Mr. Weitrich can address that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| My understanding is that the total cost, you would be looking at well over half a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| dollars, probably something approaching $800,000 total for both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| of those projects. The proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| settlement of these claims calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| Natural Resources to waive approximately $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| that the county unquestionably owes under the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| That is for uncollected tipping fees from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| March of this year to date and for uncollected price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:43| increases under the CPI adjustment language in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| In addition to that, and this is significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| Natural Resources would agree to waive or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| release the county from any obligation under the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| to upgrade and permit the forks of the river site. We're no longer contractually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| obligated to do that and we avoid that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| They also agree to waive any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| contractual obligation to expand the concrete pad at Solway and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| thereby would avoid those costs. On the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| if we elect to proceed with those improvements, they agree to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| up to a third of the costs for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:27| up to $60,000 for each facility, so a potential of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| $20,000 in the costs that they would kick in. So it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| just a matter of the county waiving whatever revenue sharing is owed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| in exchange for $30,000. We would receive more than that under the settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| agreement and that's important to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| Additionally, going forward, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| biosolids would be eliminated and the concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| have been raised with the odor and the safety, while we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| believe that those have met the regulatory standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| that's eliminated going forward. Biosolids would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| Because there are valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| and disputed contract claims between the county and natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| resources and because the county has potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| and potentially significant exposure if we litigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| those claims, we believe that the terms of this settlement agreement are fair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| reasonable and in the best interest of the county and we strongly recommend that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| You may have addressed this in your summary, but I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| that tomorrow that Judge Weaver will issue an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| regarding the False Claims Act. Is that true or not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| It was set for hearing tomorrow. The county, as I said, has filed a motion to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:51| that lawsuit. It was set for hearing tomorrow, late Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| We got a call from the court advising that that hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| is going to be rescheduled. Council for Mr. Mays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| has subpoenaed a number of witnesses and anticipates putting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| a great deal of evidence for the court to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| and the court has advised us that it does not have room on its docket Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| to undergo such a lengthy hearing. So we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| reschedule that hearing and a date has not been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| Again, though, the county is moving to dismiss that lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| regardless of what action the commission takes on the proposed settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| of the contract claims. I guess this is to a certain degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| a theoretical question, but if the court does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| what are they deciding? Are they deciding that it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| justified suit or what are they actually going to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| after the witnesses are brought forth and the hearing is completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| What will they actually decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| What the county has filed is under the False Claims Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| just to remind you of the procedure under that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| and it's a unique and complex statute, but it allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| a private citizen, any private citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| to file a lawsuit on behalf of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| or the state, in this case Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| The county then has the opportunity to decide whether it wants to get involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| in the lawsuit or not and that's called intervening and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| because this lawsuit involved an existing contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| with an existing contractor, we felt it was important to have council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| go ahead and intervene in the lawsuit and investigate those claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| through the discovery process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| After that's done, it actually can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| at any stage, but the county has the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| to ask that the suit, because it's a suit brought in its name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| be dismissed if it has good cause for doing so and good cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| is a very broad standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| and in this case the good cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| the primary reason is that the evidence has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| extensively evaluated and it's felt that the evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| simply will not support a finding of liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| under the False Claims Act and therefore it's really not worth putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| the time and resources into litigating that claim. So it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| independent of the merits of the lawsuit. Now the court will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| hear what Mr. Amaze has to say about that, but the court ultimately, what they'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| to decide is does the county have a good reason for dismissing this lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| and we believe that if the court finds that it does, that the case will be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| I guess what my question is, what happens if the court does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| What if the court agrees that there's not good cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| to dismiss it and it's going to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| Well that is a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| and it's a bridge that we'll have to cross when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| Ultimately I think the answer is that Mr. Amaze would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| to litigate that case if he wants to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| if he prevailed then there would be a finding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| natural resources had in fact committed false claims violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| and the county would share in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| recovery under that lawsuit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| from that point would also have to evaluate whether cause exists to terminate the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| if there is a contract in place at that time. I guess what my question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| is that we're getting ready to vote on a mediation agreement. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| How does that work if the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| if we as representatives of the county accept this mediation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| then the court feels that there's just reason to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| with the lawsuit and let's say ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| this is all theoretical I realize, but then let's say that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| a finding in favor of Mr. Amaze who ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| represents the county. Now we have a mediation agreement where we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| mediated an agreement but yet now there's a court ruling that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| was fraud involved. How does that work? What would happen then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| They stand independently. The mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| agreement covers only the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| breach of contract claims between the county and natural resources. It does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| address the false claims lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| My name is Dean Farmer, 617| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| Main Street. Mr. Weitrick asked me to speak and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| respond directly to Commissioner Briggs. The issue before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| court in the false claims proceeding, which is what I was hired to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| involves whether there was fraud or not. We're not here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| compromise or settle fraud. If there is a fraud claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| that will be recovered on behalf of the county, if that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| legitimate claim. We have conducted extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| investigation. Eight depositions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| 936 pages, 1,200 pages of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:19| exhibits, 260 pages of discovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| 166 pages attached to Brad Mays' complaint and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| other miscellaneous reports that Brad Mays has at various times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| over the last six months provided us through kind of a steady stream of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:35| We have reviewed that. We have gone over it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7955)|
| 2:12:39| the county officials involved, discussed it with the expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| reviewed the report from the EPA that was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| in July of 07, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| concerning a number of stages of the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| out at natural resources, and concluded that there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| evidence of fraud here. There are some disputes, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| some conflicting evidence about disagreements about who has contract claims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| but as the prosecuting authority, we don't believe there is any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| fraud. That is what is the subject of our motion to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| and that the court will rule on it. And as a court can, obviously it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| rule against us. But if it ruled against us, the court would then have to go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| and try a lawsuit to determine that natural resources was guilty of fraud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| and they're not released from that under this mediation. They would still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| whatever obligations occur statutorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| Here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| the effort has been at the direction of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| commission. I was asked to, I was brought into the participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| when county commission wanted a mediation. Mr. Lou| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| Haygood served as mediator. The mediation was conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| for approximately two days. Several county officials, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| Scott Moore, Hugh Holt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| Rob McConkey, Tom Salter, and Bruce Weitrick, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| participated. We reviewed the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| costs involved, and which primarily from the county's point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| the, for example, the obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| to do permitting at Forks in the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| would include design cost, pond cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| and pad cost. And I'm told that that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| the range of a half million dollars. There's a pad extension for permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| preservation at Solway that wasn't done, and there were some reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| it wasn't done. There were trade-offs about under the operation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| Mr. John Evans that were fully disclosed and known. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| for whatever reason, when you balance these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| this information back and forth, and you try to conclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| what's a reasonable thing for Knox County to do for the next three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:59| years to operate that facility, what you have before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| is a mediation agreement which effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| resolves a number of those contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:11| disputes and were endorsed by the participants. I think, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| Scott Moore said in the intergovernmental meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| this is in the best interest of Knox County. I'm not happy about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| all of it, but it is in the best interest of Knox County, and I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| And that's exactly my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| There are a number of details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| about cost of living increases, renting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| additional spaces, revenue sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| There's a lot of detail in some of this, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| went through a good bit of it in the mediation. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| fundamentally, this gives the county a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| short window, three years, to consider what it wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| to do, make decisions about how to do an appropriate RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:07| going forward, and I think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| committed not to do any biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| in the form of the sewer-solid issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| that were going forward, and this will be a much different kind of composting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| operation during that time. But anyway, I'd be happy to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| any questions. Commissioner Wright. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| Chairman. I'd like to sort of extend a little bit of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| Commissioner Briggs is questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| This issue's been here longer than I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| on county commission, and the thing that concerns me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| the issue that concerns me is that sometime in the next few weeks we may find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| that this contractor with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| has committed fraud. Now, whether or not that's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| I don't know. You will not find that out in the next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| Commissioner Wright. That will probably be about a year and a half from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:07| In the next few weeks, what you will find out is whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| court's going to grant the motion to dismiss on behalf of the county. That's all you'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| What will then happen is a new court date, new scheduling, additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| depositions, further experts, testimony, and a trial would occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:23| at which point you would get the kind of issue you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| But it's either released or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| It's not released. As a matter of fact, you've got a vendor working for you that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| assert a pretty strong claim against. Right. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| that I'm being asked to vote right at this moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| with incomplete facts. The reality is, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| you can't settle a fraud claim. It's not an assert fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| But I can vote for or against this mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| And I'm in favor of the mediated settlement. I need to say that up front. I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| want the county commission dealing with someone who's committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| fraud. So if these charges are not, if they're upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| or whatever, I don't know what's going to happen. But I think that some things have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| said tonight or this afternoon that I may not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| a complete grasp of before they were presented just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| moments ago. So is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| No. I move that this be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| Commissioner Wright, if I could, to address your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| concerns further, let me ask Mr. Farmer to explain or summarize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| again for the commission, if you would, what the alleged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| false claims are and why it's your evaluation that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| do not constitute false claims. Mr. Chairman, before we continue, I've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| a motion and I'd like to know whether it's seconded. Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| I'll move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| Mr. Farmer, could you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| Yes, I will. Commissioner Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| to the extent that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| a conviction, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| a fraud, the termination provisions in this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| are still in place. Nobody's changing that and nobody's releasing anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| from any kind of fraud claim. With respect to the allegations that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| the False Claims Act, there are four. The first one is that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| contaminated material in the product and that the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| were not conducted properly. That has been voluntarily dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| by the quid tem plaintiff and we agreed to join in that. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| claim is gone in the False Claims Act. The second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| is that there was revenue sharing that should have been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| The revenue sharing issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| involves disputes as to whether that by the director of solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| waste was effectively waived. There is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| statements and in fact recorded statements by Brad Mays of Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| John Evans where he represented that he did in fact waive the revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| sharing for a whole host of reasons involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| the upstart of the operation and their inability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| to recover the cost that they were supposed to recover under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:19| envisioned operation of the contract. I think you've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| Mr. Weitrick say that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| endorses kind of the concept, the tradeoff so to speak, but that it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| properly handled in terms of being brought to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| But at any rate, those are the disputed issues there. The third claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| is that there are certain issues behind what's known as a tons and stats report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| Tons and stats report is a report that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| the solid waste department gathers from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| It involves innumerable vendors. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| kept on a very loose format of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| phone calls and receipts of information and the contention is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| that some information received from natural resources doesn't conform to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| tons and stats report that went to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| state. There are ranges of where this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| came from. It was not a strict accounting of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| and quite frankly it is a measure of what comes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| the facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| there is no claim by the county against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| natural resources for what comes into the facility. That's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| a basis for any kind of claim that the county asserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| The Quinton plaintiff wants to do another calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| and say well if you've got this much in you should have this much out and so there's a debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| there but there is no basis for a claim for inputting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| bringing materials into the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| The final one involved, the final claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| was added by amendment. What happened was there was an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| situation that arose in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| I believe it was in the spring of 06 if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:11| The TDAC had permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| brush to be stored off of the concrete pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| at Solway. That was a critical factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| because there's only so much concrete pad out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| Because of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| that had been committed to expand the Solway pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| were used by permission, it was a grant the county got, but they got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| permission from the state to use these granted funds to expand the pad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| fix the pond, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| tension pond issue where a leak had occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| There were no funds that ever came forward to expand that pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| The TDAC became very upset about the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| failure to follow through on their commitment to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| the pad at Solway and in the spring they finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| decided we're going to retract our kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| waiver for the kind of grace period we gave where you got some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| time, you used some funds, and we're going to require you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| put everything on the pad. Because we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| you can't do it, you're going to have to expand the pad, so we're going to require you to put everything on the pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| In April, that requirement gave them 60 days. They would either put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| everything on the pad or lose their permit and John Evans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| authorized the charge of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| $27,500 to grind materials and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| the vendor said I'll do it, but I want to be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| more quickly through natural resources and they can apply for reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| John Evans said fine. He signed off on both the invoice that came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| natural resources and the check request that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| submitted and paid. And that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| done to preserve the permit at Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| So those are the four claims that are involved in the false claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| matter. Does that cover what you wanted, Mr. McConkie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| Yes, sir. And just to add to that, there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| Tennessee court decisions interpreting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| the Tennessee False Claims Act. But our False Claims Act is closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| patterned on the federal act. And the federal courts have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| been quite clear that disagreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| and differences of opinion regarding the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| and performance of contracts are not the basis for false claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| Disagreements and differences of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| regarding the interpretation and enforcement of administrative regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:51| are not valid bases for claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| under the False Claims Act. And Mr. Farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| had prepared and submitted, that's included with your materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| a memorandum in support of the county's motion to dismiss the Tennessee False Claims Act case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| filed by Mr. Mays, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| found, among his research, found no cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| where the government had asked that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| Quee Tam complaint be dismissed. There were no cases where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:23| the trial court refused to do that. I believe there was one case where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| the trial court did refuse it, and they were reversed on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| Nothing is ever a slam dunk, but based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| Mr. Farmer's evaluation as county counsel in the false claims litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:39| which we have reviewed his evaluation as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| it is our strong feeling and our strong recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| that that case is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| dismissed. Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I spent an hour and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| with Mr. Greaves, an hour with Mr. Draper, an hour with Mr. McConkie, plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| numerous phone calls, emails, etc. There are two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:07| things that I have come to the conclusion with. Number one, this comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| as no surprising one, this is a mess. Having gone through this for several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| years, it doesn't speak well of Knox County as to how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| was handled, and I'll also say that NRR is not completely void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| of this because it seemed to me at some point someone would stand up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| say, wait a minute, this is not working the way it's supposed to work, let's sit down and let's talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| about this and let's do something. The second thing that I've come to the conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| is there's money to be made in this. This reminds me of the cola wars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| or the beer wars when there's somebody going after a contract, and we've seen a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| of things going on, and so it's obvious to me that there's some money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| be made with this. I do have some questions that I'd like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| that came from the committee meeting, and I want to make these as brief as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| possible. My first question is, let's say that we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| against this mediation, Mr. McConkie, and we go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| court, let's say NRR sues us or we sue someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| or it ends up in court, and I'm talking about the claims thing, will this be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| judge action or will we go before a jury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| I don't have a definite answer to that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| I think either party would have the right to request a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| So there's a chance that we would have to go before a jury to talk about everything that's gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| with that. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| Weitrich, we're not taking biosolids under this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| agreement. What happens to biosolids? Do they just go away? I mean, it has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| go somewhere. Yes, sir. We suspended biosolids on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| July the 1st. It will be up to utility districts to deal specifically with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| their own biosolids. They'll have to make other arrangements. For instance, KUB is my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| they land apply a lot of their biosolids, treated biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| Mr. Jones, it had come up about wells in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| and I believe there was to be a test of a well. Is Mr. Jones here? I'd like to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| if that well was tested and if it was, what were the results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| I know that the wells came back clean so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| They're waiting on an arsenic test for the POPs well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| The POPs decided to go ahead and test it. Mr. Mays, I think he asked Mr. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| Let me get Mr. Jones here, because I know you're going to have an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| speak here in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| Mr. Jones, my question was there had come up a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| about the wells. Have the wells been tested there from the party that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| was here and what were the results of that? Commissioner, they have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:39| tested and we have the results. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| the homeowners here, and I would like to get permission before I give you the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| results. I think that probably would be the proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:51| Is it okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| if I give them the results? The results were negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| on both bacteria and E. coli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| Okay. Thank you. Mr. Farmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| do you have any conflict at all with regards to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| And I don't mean to say that in a negative way. I just want to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| that as you investigated this, you're saying there was no fraud in your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| You spent a lot of time looking at this. Do you have any conflict at all in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| Do you know anybody on either side? Is there anything that would taint your viewpoint of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| I had absolutely no involvement in any of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| until I got a call from John Owens out of the blue in the fall of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| John Troyer, regardless of where this goes and regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| of who gets the contract, I would like to see a contract administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8983)|
| 2:29:47| appointed to oversee this contract to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| that regardless of who gets it, that the terms are being done the way they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:55| supposed to be done. And if there's any question at all, this contract administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| comes back to commission. Would you agree to appoint a contract administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| to oversee this contract? I have somebody in mind from the purchasing department to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| And who would that be? Matt Myers. Okay. Mr. McConkie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| as I understand it, the contract is over June 30th. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| The original contract term did expire June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| This commission extended that for one month, so it will expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| July 31st. Okay. So if we say, if we defer for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| days, as is the motion on the floor, they would just get another 38-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| and we would, or? Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| They have not indicated an agreement to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| We haven't asked. Frankly, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| a mediated settlement agreement based on an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:47| for three years of the existing contract, or alternatively on the commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:51| agenda is a proposed ground lease for ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:55| that was the result of an RFP process. It was recommended to be awarded to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| If the mediated settlement agreement is not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| frankly, the county will be in a precarious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:07| And my final question is, what does the contract say about fraud? It was mentioned here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| that if indeed this, let's say this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| is approved, you go to court, they're found that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| fraud, they said that in the contract there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| clause there that this contract could be reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| What the contract says is that the contract may be terminated for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| And we would evaluate at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| if fraud were found, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:39| as the county's, as Mr. Farmer has alluded, it's his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| strong evaluation that there was no fraud and no false claims. But if it were found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| I think we could certainly take the position that cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| exists to terminate the contract. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:55| Go ahead, Brad. My name is Bradley Mays. I live at 1817| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee. I gave each one of you all a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:03| packet today. The front page of it says a whistleblower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| seeks his share from the county. We were in an identical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| situation to this a little over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| Knox County entered into a mediated settlement. Zero dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| crossed the table. Everybody was sure that there was no fraud involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| that there were no false claims. My attorney was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| the attorney involved in this case. Mr. McConkie was the attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| representing the county. My attorney went to court and won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| Guess what happened? Knox County is going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| to pay the judgment. Now let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| This was a relatively small case. The case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| here involves $336,000 of unpaid revenue sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| based on their numbers submitted of retail products sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:55| They've got it broke down. This is how much dyed mulch is, how much black, how much red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| how much green, topsoil, whatever. Their numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:03| reflect $336,000 owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| If Mr. Evans agreed to them submitting this invoice to grind this brush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| the problem is the contractor had already been paid to dispose of it and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| contract says they have to dispose of it in a timely matter. But who told the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| contractor to tell Knox County it was pre-existing brush in their invoice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| I feel that was a false invoice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| This contractor has also made multiple claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| saying we never got the 15,000 tons of green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| waste that was represented to us. When I started asking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| this money, they said they only got like 9,800 tons for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| 2003. I'm holding in my hand a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| on natural resources recovery letterhead. It was sent from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| Ken Eckert and signed by Ken Eckert. It was mailed on November 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:55| 2003. And this was sent to Rodney Rocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| as per your request. The following are the green waste tonnages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| accepted. They were reporting well over 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| tons of green waste by September of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| How can their claim now that they only got like 96 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| 9,800 tons of green waste for the whole year be the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| One of these two statements has to be false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| They cannot have only received 9,800 tons of green waste for the whole year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| if they had already received well over 10,000 tons partially through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| They said they got this green waste on their letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9271)|
| 2:34:35| 2004. Oh, incidentally, in 03, I called the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:39| state recycling coordinator back and asked, I want to know specifically what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| was dedicated to natural resources recovery. He dug through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| files and he has informed me it was a little over 15,000 tons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:51| for the year. This would also reflect what was reported back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:55| to the Department of Neighborhoods in their letter and their news report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| or the little news release they had done not long after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| I have another letter here dated August 22, 2005| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| from Natural Resources Recovery on Joe Daniels Road. Attention, Rodney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| Rocket. As per your request, here are the following green waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| tonnages accepted. They reported a total of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| 14,971 tons. Almost exactly 15,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| tons like Knox County predicted. But when I asked where our money was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| they said we only received 9,000 and some odd tons of green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:31| waste for 2004 and therefore you're in contract violation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| we don't owe you the money. The original claims that they made on why they don't owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:39| Knox County was that they didn't even receive 10,000 tons a year and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:43| have the documents on their letterhead and what nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| counted on is there's a lot of documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| disappeared the month that my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| case was unsealed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| Lynn Mays has a fantastic stack of documents in Saltway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| and I'm still finding documents, Mr. Salter. Fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| treasure trove of documents from the TDEC file and I assure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| you I can prove a false claim and if you all sign this mediation agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9371)|
| 2:36:15| if it goes the same way that this case did in the termite and pest control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| case, Knox County is going to be on the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| for the full judgment. That's what happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| So this is a possibility if you all accept this mediation agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| Now there's a few other issues I'd like to cover very briefly because I know you've spent a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| time on this. You've got about one more minute. Odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| Their expert told you that getting rid of biosolids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| does not get rid of odor and that packet I gave you on the last two pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| is when they started getting odor control complaints in Louisiana from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| composting. It lays out that we got several calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| and it was right after they windrowed the compost piles, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| When I talked to the Louisiana representatives, they said they can't think of a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9419)|
| 2:37:03| when they weren't getting complaints about this contractor in Louisiana. And you know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| that made me think? There's been two public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| countless, there's been multiple, multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| things signed by the community members, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| petitions, complaints, and I can't think of a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| in the last four years that we haven't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| residents of the Solway community upset over this contractor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| odor problems. And when I talked to Louisiana, it's the same for ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| years, and I just want to touch two quick things that you all might want to touch base with, Mr. Pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| When I looked over these documents, one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| why I said they have to be selling more mulch than they're reporting is like in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| 2004, they only sold approximately half of the compost they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| produced. And in 2007, I've got their documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| right here, I mean this is according to them, in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9475)|
| 2:37:59| they reported that they manufactured like 38,000 tons of compost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| and they only sold like 20,000 tons of compost. Where did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:07| the other 18,000 tons go? I was having a conversation with Mr. Pop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| about this, and I think he answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| Do you remember when he was talking about digging the ditch and he thought they were going to bury stuff in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| Well, in 2004, they manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| and produced 7,000 more tons of compost than they sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| It happens in 2005, Mr. Pop took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| some pictures of some stuff that he feels was being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| disposed of inappropriately off the back northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| corner of his property, including ashes and compost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| pushed off with a dozer and covered with dirt and had grass seed planted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:47| Who gave them permission to do this on our property and who's going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| an environmental determination to see what the county's responsibility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9531)|
| 2:38:55| if what's buried on our property, we've had two major grading projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| happen there, they never went through purchasing, nobody came out and looked at them ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| nothing was ever ran through purchasing whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| they simply sent the dozers out and Knox County paid the bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9547)|
| 2:39:11| and we don't know what's happened, but I know that there's a lot of material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| that if it wasn't sold, at first I thought they had to sell it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| so they owed us money. Why did you need to wrap it up? Well, I think I figured out where it's went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| and you all ought to ask Mr. Pop about that and ask him about why they tried to rent his house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9563)|
| 2:39:27| when the well issue came about. Why did this company try to rent his house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9567)|
| 2:39:31| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| Thank you. I would like to have everybody stand up who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| been involved in this. First of all, I'd like to see who the neighbors are. Are there neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| of this property in the audience? Can you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| I'd also like to have any Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9587)|
| 2:39:51| employees stand. I want to know any lobbyists out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:55| any attorneys, anybody who participated in mediated settlement. Could you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| stand please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| Okay. There are a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:07| here. I thank all of you for being recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9607)|
| 2:40:11| This has gone on and on. I agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| I want to know, I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| we decided to have this go into mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| I would like to know why did we hire David| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| Farmer to take this over? Could someone please answer that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| The law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| Mr. DeFreeze, I'll do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| the best I can and then if Mr. Owings wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| chime in, he's welcome to do that, I guess. Mr. Farmer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:47| was hired to be independent counsel in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:51| Frankly, before the lawsuit was filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| Mr. Mays came to the law department with some of his concerns and brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| some of his documents and his evidence. He met with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| He told me that he expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| to have more information within the next two to three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| After that, this was in, I want to say July of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| last year. Mr. Mays can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| After that meeting, I waited for more information from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| Mr. Mays and we never met again. Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| Mr. Mays hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| County's name under the False Claims Act. One of the things that struck me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9691)|
| 2:41:35| from that meeting was that Mr. Mays was extremely mistrustful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| of and for reasons that I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| dispute because I wasn't involved in his interactions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| Knox County employees previously. But he was mistrustful of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| administration. He was mistrustful of the Solid Waste Department at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| It was clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| if there were any reason to suspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| an evaluation of his claims was biased, that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9727)|
| 2:42:11| would become an issue. To avoid that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| to avoid any appearance of a conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:19| our office, knowing at the time that the lawsuit was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| filed that this appeared to be more a breach of contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| claim than a false act claim, hired independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| counsel to provide independent evaluation of those claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| and make a recommendation with regard to how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| Okay, thank you. I also want to know then, why did you continue to sit in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| mediation when we also had David Farmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| I sat in on the mediation because what was being mediated was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| more than just false claims allegations. Mediation covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:55| the potential breach of contract claims between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| the county and the contractor, going both ways. I mean, the county has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| potential claims against them. They have potential claims against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| None of those claims have been filed in court, but they exist nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| And they were being addressed. Mr. Farmer was retained only with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| examining and evaluating the false claims allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| Okay. Then I'd also like to ask you, since you sat in on the mediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| in your opinion, who violated or breached the contract first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| Was it Knox County or was it Natural Resource Recovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9807)|
| 2:43:35| That's a very complicated question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| It appears that from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| neither party adhered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| strictly to the terms of the contract. And I think it would be virtually impossible to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| what breach occurred first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| nor am I certain that that would be relevant in any litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| Okay. I have another question. I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| contacted the purchasing department to ask about contracts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| if we are allowed to enter into anything beyond a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| And they said yes, that we could enter into contracts for 25 years. But when I looked at the PDF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:15| file about purchasing regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| long-term agreements, it says that some contracts are written to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:23| for an option to renew for additional years. When this arrangement is in the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| interest of Knox County, it will be utilized. If a contract with option to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| renew is utilized, the renewal is subject to the following conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:35| And number three, I think what might apply here, it says that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| merchandise quality and vendor service has been satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| So if there's all these questions and breaches of contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| I don't understand why we would extend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| contract when it appears that it may not have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| satisfactory. Can you answer that? I mean, am I reading the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| information for purchasing and contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| I believe you are reading some of the right information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| I think there's an additional section that says multi-year contracts can be entered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| into when the purchasing department determines that that is in the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9911)|
| 2:45:15| interest of the county given the nature and circumstances of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| This is the type of operation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| tends to lend itself to a longer-term agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| And that's a determination that's made by the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| With respect to renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| again, from the county's consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:39| and neither you nor I nor most of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| sitting in here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| have the proper training and background to be able to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| whether they have met their regulatory standards. We have to rely on our experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| and on the regulatory bodies. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| are under constant regulation, constant evaluation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| our consultants tell us that they have operated properly and in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| with the regulatory standards. And the regulatory bodies have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| taken any action to revoke our permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| And you are correct. I did contact the gentleman with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9975)|
| 2:46:19| EPA out of Atlanta, and I did post that in the electronic form for the commissioners who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| viewed that. And they said that they are working right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| to check on the compliance, and they're going over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| and they are trying to determine compliance. And you're correct. I feel very inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9991)|
| 2:46:35| There's voluminous, I mean, on my shelves at home I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| stacks and stacks and stacks. But this mediated settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=9999)|
| 2:46:43| I wonder what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10003)|
| 2:46:47| cost? Mr. McConkie, what is the cost analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| of this mediated settlement? Do you know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| I guess I'm not sure what you mean by cost analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| The value. What is the value of this mediated? Because it is in essence a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| right? The settlement agreement, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| a contract. It releases causes of action that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10027)|
| 2:47:11| between the county and natural resources recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| The value of the claims that have been asserted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| we've gone over that. Natural resources asserts claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| or asserts that it has potential claims against the county worth up to $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| We might quibble with that, but it appears clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| that the actual cost to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| for curing its defaults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10055)|
| 2:47:39| the asserted defaults of failing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| upgrade and permit the Forks of the Riverside and expand the concrete pad at Solway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:47| would exceed half a million dollars. That would be the cost to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| The county's potential claim against natural resources recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080728part1?start=10071)|
