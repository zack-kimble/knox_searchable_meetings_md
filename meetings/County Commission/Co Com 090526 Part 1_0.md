| 0:05:09| Clerk 5A, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| This is a suspension revocation of the beer permit for A-1 Discount Tobacco, 25-11 East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| Governor John Sevier Highway, Allen James Armstrong is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| This is on first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| Allen Wolfie May, Niagara County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=323)|
| 0:05:34| On April 29, 2009, I sent an undercover officer in to the A-1 discount tobacco at Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| John Spear Highway, purchased a six-pack Miller Lite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:52| On 3-17-06, we also cited, I realize that we're out the three years by one month, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| on 10-09-07, we also seized some illegal video poker machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| So I'd like for you all to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:16| Mr. Chairman, could I ask Officer May a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Officer May, when you say he presented identification, did he take the identification out of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| wallet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| This one, they did ask for an ID and handed it to the clerk, and the clerk handed it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| and still sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| It was out of the wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| It was just the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| We make them take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| When they go in, they already have their ID in their pockets, not even in a wallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Wolfie, while you're up there, if you may, Mr. Chairman, if I may, describe for the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| when you use the term illegal gambling machines, would you explain that to the Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| Well, they're video poker machines, which have been illegal since the lottery was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| They did away with all other gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| And we also, when we were out checking the convenience stores and the bars, were on outlook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Were those confiscated by your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Yes, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Were they cited for that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| For it to be cited, they have to come up to the Attorney General's office to claim them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| and then they're cited upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| But we basically just confiscate any illegal gambling machines, which can be the Cherry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| Masters, the video poker, even the stamp machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| And to your knowledge and belief, they have not made a claim with the Attorney General's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| office for the return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I'd like to hear from the offending party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=469)|
| 0:07:58| Is there someone from A1 Discount Tobacco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Sir, state your name for the record and your business address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| Allen Armstrong, 2511 Governor John Severe Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| Jim, did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| What is your comments in regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Tell the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And regarding these video poker machines, I presume you're not going to make a claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I'll defer to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Thanks, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Mr. Slaughter, I guess I'm trying to understand your line of questioning to Officer Wolfie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| in terms of what are you saying as a result of him not making a claim to these video poker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=531)|
| 0:09:00| machines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Because I think he presented the information for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| So I guess I'm looking to you for guidance as to how we should consider the confiscation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| of these video poker machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| The Attorney General, because of the nature and the law not being exactly crystal clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| on this and there not being a lot of substantive case law or case law upon which the prosecutors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| can rely, their policy has been that they're not going to prosecute someone for merely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| possessing these machines unless and until they actually come forward and seek their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| That's a policy that they've adopted and for which I really can't comment as to the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| or wisdom of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| The only reason I questioned the inspectors so that you know that because of the way your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| ordinance is written, you can consider what you may feel to be aggravating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| At this juncture, they did have in their possession illegal gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| If you feel that it is so egregious that it requires a separate penalty, you can certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| have the right to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| That was the only reason for the questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Yes, question for Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| How long have you had this business, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Four years in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| And this is your first defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| What were the circumstances of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Was this a new employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Somebody been there a while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| No, she's been there since I opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| So what was her excuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| You said she checked the ID and handed it back to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| I guess she just didn't add up the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Do you not have the cash register that you put the date in and it kicks it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Does they not know what the little red strip is on the side of the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| Know what the what is now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| The red strip at the edge of the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| I don't know if she does or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| I didn't know it had a red strip on the side of the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| That means they're underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| You just added up the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| If it adds up to 21, it adds up to 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| You don't have to be a mathematician in order to not sell to somebody underage if you look at an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=669)|
| 0:11:19| If you look at that sample he just showed you there, it shows you a very easy way to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| Now they do have to take it out of their billfold or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| Aren't there some people over 21 that still have this on their license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| None?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| So what's the disposition of this employee now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Worked with you for four years and you fire her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Can't add up the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| I mean, I had no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Have all of your people been through the trainer program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| Yeah, she was trained by a beer borer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| That's all I have, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Mr. Armstrong, the reason I asked the question earlier of Officer May about the license out of the wallet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| was exactly that, that Commissioner Brown just pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Because those licenses do have a red mark around there and that's instant indication that the recipient is under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| I must say I would suggest, pretty strongly suggest, that you might want to take that course as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| because you seem to stumble just a bit in not knowing what that was, unaware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| And so there may be part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| So my question is, what are you going to do different in the future to prevent a problem like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=757)|
| 0:12:48| I just keep reminding them, show them this right here, the red thing on the license, and remind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| I tell them all the time, write notes all the time, check IDs, check IDs, check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| What else can I tell them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| I can't be there with them 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I told her and told her and told her and she still sold it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| Well, it bothers me since the identification is readily, it should be noticed that it's different with that red mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| around the photo and that's an indication that that person is under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| It's hard to believe she still sold it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| That's the reason I think I would strongly suggest that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| and perhaps the rest of your employees retake the course offered by the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| I have just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I don't know if anyone here can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| But for the cash registers, the reason, sir, that question came up is that some of the larger stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| and I realize for smaller stores it may be a question of expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| There are lockouts when beer comes through where you have to check it and sell the beer without checking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| You'd have to do an override on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Does anyone know how much it costs to add that computerized feature or whatever to a cash register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| You know, I see people, you know, like you who are down here paying $500, $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| and now it's going to be more fines and I just don't know how much that costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| $500 to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| $500 to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| You know, I just wonder, just so you don't get stuck with another, you know, another fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| if it might be worthwhile to consider that if it's $500 to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| You know, it would stop the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| and it would also keep you from maybe having to pay in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| What do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Are you done, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Make a motion to a $500 fine and 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| I have a motion for a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=892)|
| 0:15:01| Would it be appropriate to ask this gentleman to provide for us in writing within the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| what he intends to do to prevent this from happening again or the fine goes up to $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| I think it would be good for us to have in writing because I'm hearing a little bit of ambiguity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| as to what maybe he plans to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Is that appropriate, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| It is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Then I would like to ask if we could amend yours to say $500 plus in writing within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| If we don't get it within 30 days, that fine goes to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Plan of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Properly moved and seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| You elect to pay the fine, sir, within seven days to the county clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Where do I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Do I pay it here now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| The old courthouse, 300 Main Street, right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Room 237.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| But be aware, sir, there is a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Within 30 days, a letter to this board in terms of remedial action where that fine can double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=958)|
| 0:16:06| 5B, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| 5B is for a suspension and revocation of the beer permit for Nays and Jays Drive-Thru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| 8769 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Gerardo Rene Huddleston is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| This is first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| Officer May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Also on April 29, 2009, a defendant did sell a six-pack of Bud Light at the Nays and Jays Drive-Thru, 8769 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:41| I actually had two undercover underage people in the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| They went through the drive-thru and no ID was asked for or checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| Is there someone from Nays and Jays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Ma'am, state your name for the record and your business address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Gerardo Rene Huddleston, 8769 Chapman Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| You heard the officer's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Do you have any response to his testimony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I did, and it did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| I had an employee that had not been through the course yet, but we had her lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| She has been through it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| She used to be a Knox County officer, so I was kind of really shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| But she's a real good employee, and I do have her register that you don't put the birth date in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| but it does prompt you on beer sales and cigarette sales to check that date and make sure it matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| You cannot go any further until you check that and then you hit enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| So I can't afford one of the great big fine ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Well, obviously, all of that expense comes to naught if they're not even asking for an ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| so hopefully that lesson was learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| I was in shock myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I'll defer to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| How long has it been since we approved this, 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| I was approved in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Yes, I got my beer license in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| I was in January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| It's not been that long, has it, EK, UK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| Hey, I can't remember yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Commissioner, let's defer to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| I believe she has the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| My point is that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| January 26th, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| January 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| My mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| So it's three months, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| I guess the little speech we give up here doesn't amount to a whole lot in some cases, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Well, I mean. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| No, we're preaching to the choir when you're up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| but, you know, there's some things that I think we are seeing that we're going to have to take some further educational steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1131)|
| 0:19:00| that we can probably do from this end and may help some of this along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and I'm going to bring those up in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| A question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Isn't that a state statute that regardless of a person's apparent age, be it 21 or 81, that the clerk asks for an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:24| The law requires them to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| That's a state statute, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Under Tennessee code, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| How is that enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| I'm not certificating a double penalty here, but what's the enforcement on that or the penalty for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Well, the enforcement is this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| What you have before you is the owner who's coming here for the civil penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| but actually the clerk would be summoned to court for criminal sanctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| For not asking for the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Regardless of a person's age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Well, generally they'll roll it into the selling of beer, but they can actually charge it as a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| and depending upon the person's record, the court can withhold adjudication or they can have a stiffer fine and penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| But in terms of local practice, Wolfie can probably give you a better idea as to whether or not they're actually separating them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| but it's up to the law enforcement's discretion how to charge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| Does someone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Yes, I'll make the same motion we just passed on the previous $500 fine or 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| and that they are to bring back a written statement on how they're going to make sure that this does not happen again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| or the fine doubles to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Do you understand the board's directions, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| As I explained, I took steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| I'll write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Send it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Send it to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| And also, do you know where to pay the fine if you choose to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| 5C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| 5C is for a suspension revocation of the beer permit for the corner market, 7512 Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| LGA Enterprising is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| This is second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| This one gets a little complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| I'm going to try to explain the best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| On April 29, 2009, the defendant did sell a six-pack of Miller Lite at the corner market Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:38| This was the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| The other one was 515 of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Now, the gentleman that I cited is on the agenda for a beer permit for this same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:52| He is, between April 29 and sometime prior to today, has filed for application for a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1312)|
| 0:22:02| So I just want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Has it been adjudicated in court, your sale to Miner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| When is the court date on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| It's on my calendar at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| I can't tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| It's either Thursday this week or sometime in the first of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| What's the permit for selling beer without a license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| If that's what we're saying, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| The citation that I've got on the gentleman that sold it on the 29th, he didn't check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| My undercover officer just walked in, bought it, paid for it, and walked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| The second offense on the corporation from April 29 back to May of 08, this is their second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:55| What I'm saying is the gentleman I cited on the 29th of April, he's here today to ask for a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| He has now bought the company out, the corporation, and he's going to be asking for a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| Maybe, Mark or Ivan, I think maybe I can help clear it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| When he was cited, he was the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Now we need to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Our law department needs to give us an update on where he stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| He was the employee when he was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Since then, he's purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Well, I guess I had my light on because I saw this coming up and I was going to have questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:42| The previous owner, I guess that's who would owe the fine on this offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Or who should be liable for because we find the owner of the business, not the employee that sells it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:59| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I guess what is troubling is the fact that he's likewise now seeking a beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| and the probability of him being adjudicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| To me, I think the best course of action is to defer this until such time as that court case is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| Should we defer both actions today, both this offense and the application then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| That would be my suggestion, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Again, I'll make a motion that we defer both 5C and the corresponding application, which is 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:37| Officer, would you think two months or Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Considering the backlog in the courts, I would think two months would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Well, let's defer this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| If I could say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Sometimes these things get postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| I've got some cases coming up this week that are from December, so they may not be adjudicated that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| If come our July meeting and it hasn't been resolved, we'll defer it again, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1501)|
| 0:25:10| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Did I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Who was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Ivan Arman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Ivan Arman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| What do they do in the meantime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Has he purchased this so he cannot sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Until such time, he's issued a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| So does anybody check to make sure that there's not been anything sold at that place in between now and the time we hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| We have the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| That was previously issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| It has been released to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| And at this time, until such time, it's resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| I don't want to put this board in a situation where you're issuing a beer license to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| who could possibly be adjudicated of a criminal offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Now, the court may not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| The court may defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| It may give them alternative dispute resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| My job is to protect the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| Mr. Chairman, when I found out that this fellow was buying this, I stopped him from selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:15| And I done got it on the agenda, which, in my opinion, it shouldn't be on the agenda to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:24| I made the mistake of putting it on there on the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| This man hadn't been caught twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| He spent all of his money trying to open a business that the fellow left town that owned the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:44| I've got a copy of his state sales tax that was dated 5-20 of this year, a copy of his business tax where it was open 5-1 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1604)|
| 0:27:01| And he was caught on the 29th of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| So he didn't get it in his name until this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:14| He's just trying to make a living, and he made a mistake and sold beer to a miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:22| Mr. Miner, is he stocking beer currently for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| He shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| When's the last time you checked it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Friday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Was there beer there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| There was signs up, no beer to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| There's no permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| They're not supposed to be able to store it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Did you order the beer companies to come pick it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| Commissioner, the beer companies will not pick beer up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| Did they pick it up on Clinton Highway last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| They did on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1675)|

| 0:33:02| Okay, you own the business, but you lease the property it's located on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=1982)|

| 0:33:54| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Is that you're going to add pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Yes, pending certain items, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| That would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2044)|

| 0:34:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| That is the items on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Members of the Board, I did give you a one-page memoranda on liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| We're getting a lot of calls about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| I think people presume that you're responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| You are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| And that memo explains it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Is there anything else that needs to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| I mentioned earlier a couple of things I think might help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| and might help some of these applicants that are coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Number one is in the clerk's office to get a standardized application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:41| We seem to have two or three different ones that come up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| and it's hard for us to keep up with which is which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I'm not sure how they do, you know, with the clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| Number two, the sheet, the color sheet that Wolfie has there showing the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| What would be wrong with having multiples of those made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| UK and Wolfie and Ms. Ann are in these stores every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| pass these things out to everybody that's selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Every time they go in there, give them one and ask them to post it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| so that they look at the thing and can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Now, you may be doing that already, are you, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| No, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with handing out an address of my underage people and their picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| Well, if then we can block that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Put your picture on there, maybe, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| I don't want to go back to being under 21 again or not, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| Well, I think there are some things that we could do that would help you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| and help these applicants, you know, if we all worked together a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| So let's just, you know, I would suggest we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2154)|
| 0:36:04| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Yes, and welcome back, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| It's good to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| One thing that we could do, I know from when I was in the food and beverage industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| there was a book that was published that not only showed the Tennessee driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| but it showed the driver's license for every state in the union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| and how to tell a real one from a fake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| We could start requiring that these folks purchase that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2187)|
| 0:36:35| What did you do, Lumpkin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| You bring beer with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| UK, come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Got a beer issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Hey, I have a feeling this is going to be a long, rough meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| But as much as I wish this was scotch, it's iced tea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| I think Ms. Brunson has something she'd like to address, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Go ahead, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2217)|

| 0:43:59| And this is on the moratorium that we've placed on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=2639)|

| 0:56:26| Exchange Member of the UT Chancellor's Associates and UT Women's Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3386)|

| 0:56:33| and the Board of Tennessee Association for Community Leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Whereas Ms. Delaney's work with Leadership of Knoxville has garnered her into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| 1998 Outstanding Tennessee Leadership Educator Award for the Tennessee Association of Community Leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3401)|

| 0:56:55| 2002 YWCA Tribute to Women Award in Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| Whereas it is fitting for local governments to recognize and salute the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| who have themselves as public servants and citizens of whom we can all be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| The Knox County Commission hereby honors and commends Jeannie Delaney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| for her 25 years of local service to the leadership of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| and we extend to her best wishes for every future success upon her retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Jeannie Delaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| Be it further resolved that if any notifications are to be made to effectuate this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| then the county clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the proper authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| as provided by the chart of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| Thank you, Jeannie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| You're going to get one of these from the county commission and one from the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| so I'll let the mayor speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| It's an honor to be here today as we recognize our friend Jeannie Delaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| We've been friends for longer than I can actually imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| I forgot about the Chamber of Commerce days until that was just read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| but I'm a proud graduate of the leadership Knoxville class of 1989,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| and Jeannie was running things back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| That's 20 years ago, if my math is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| But I can tell you something about Jeannie that I think defines her as a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Not only did she do a great job in the position that she was being employed in and paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| but she's also been a great mom and a great community volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| A lot of people in her position would have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| gee, you know, I don't have time to do other type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| I'm just going to do my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| But she served on the board at the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| She's been active with the Executive Women's Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| with her alma mater, the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| where she served on the Women's Council and the Chancellor's Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and that list truly goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| And when you look at organizations similar to leadership Knoxville across this state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| and across this country, both have recognized her for the extraordinary job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| that she has done over the years and the many talents that she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| So, Jeannie, you are a true asset to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| We appreciate you greatly, and I'm very proud to call you my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| And thanks so much for what you've done for Knoxville and Knox County over the past several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| and we look forward to your continued involvement in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:29| Did you forget the beautification board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Did you forget the beautification board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| Jeannie, I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you from those commissioners like myself that have been involved in leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| Your effect probably on Knoxville and Knox County would be very hard to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| It will be very hard to measure into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| It's dramatic, and we appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| and we wish you the best in a very active and engaged retirement, which I'm sure you'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| We will not allow you to leave Knox County very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:18| Well, I've never had the honor to address county commissions, so they said I could do maybe 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| First of all, this was a complete surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Commissioner Norman just said be here at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| I thought maybe he just wanted me to see my county government at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| I may stick around and watch that for a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| But this honor really humbles me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| and it's been my pleasure to serve the community in which I was born for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| As director of leadership Knoxville, I hope I can continue to serve in just as meaningful a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| So particularly good to see you back, Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| You look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| I'm glad to be back on the day that you're back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| and thank you all so much again, particularly for the standing ovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| I will show this to my mother, and she'll be very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3662)|
| 1:01:23| On page 12, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| establishing a general county budget, making appropriations from the several funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| for departments, institutions, offices, and agencies of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009 and ending June 30, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| approving the organization of the executive branch of the Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| and designating the proceeds from the sale of state street property to offset the defined benefit plan cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| I will make a motion to approve the budget with a couple of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| I want to add $12,000 to the Cerebral Palsy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| I want to add $10,000 to the Helen Ross McNabb Mother Goose Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| And those two items will be funded out of the current 2008-2009 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| so it's not going to come out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Can I interrupt Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Don't we first have to deal with item 802 before we're getting to 803 through 802?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| We're on 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Is 802 part of your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| To pass the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| Pass the budget with these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Is it considered part of a budget motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Commissioner Lutho, did you switch those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Cerebral palsy is $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| Well, that's what I was going to go by, but we can switch them if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| I think you said, I think you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| I had $12,000 for the cerebral palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| You don't have $12,000 for the Helen Ross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Well, I think the original cerebral palsy request was $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Mother Goose was $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Well, then just reverse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| We'll do the $12,000 for the Helen Ross Mother Goose Program, $10,000 for the cerebral palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:34| And that will come from this current budget that we're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| so it doesn't affect the budget that we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| But we do have to approve that through the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| And also, I want to delete the references to the proceeds from the State Street site sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Because we don't know that if we're even going to get an offer or if we're going to sell it or how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| So I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| And, Mr. Law Director, although I do work for the Knox County Trustee, it's your opinion that I can vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| I would like to add an amendment that we appropriate $8,000 out of the current year's budget for the Senior Information Referral Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| And I have discussed this with John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| You're talking about where we just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Where you got $10,000 for cerebral palsy and $12,000 for Mother Goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| We need to also do $8,000 for the Senior Information Referral Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| The Senior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Information Referral Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| If there's not any objections from the rest of the commission and if John Troyer believes that we can do that, I'll be happy to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3882)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| It's hard for me to believe we're making a motion to approve this budget and we haven't even discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| There's a lot of questions we need to ask about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| Well, by putting a motion out there, then that allows us to get into a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| Per our rules, we're not even allowed to discuss an item until there's a motion made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| No, but if we weren't to approve this budget, we said we would have a meeting June the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| If we can't come up with something today, then we have a date set aside so that we can come back and discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| and see if we can't do something further on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| You know, last year we asked for more time for the budget to be presented to us sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| so we would have a chance to look at it better and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Now, they did get it to us sooner this month, but you're asking us to vote on it with no more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| Normally this budget is presented to us in June and we vote on it to last of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| This year it was presented in May and we're voting on it here the last of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| We need to slow this down and start looking at some of these things in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| We've got a lot of things here that I want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| If you want to turn the floor to me, I'll ask my questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| But right now, as it stands, I would have to vote against this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Now, I appreciate you putting in deleting the part of the State Street Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| because when we put this out for proposals here a few months ago, I suggested we fund the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:27| the money for their lawns, for their security, use some of that money for the pension fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| and the rest of it to go in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| As Commissioner Fenbar-Sanders said, we should not be spending money at that time that we do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| We should not be designating, he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| So I appreciate you pulling that out because the commission went along with him on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| and here we are designating money in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| But you've made a motion to pull it and got a second on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| But I just can't vote for this budget until we have a good discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| Now, last month, Commissioner McKenzie supported me in saying we need to slow this down and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:14| And I just feel like we do now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| I've got a lot of things I'd like to ask about it, and they may all be legit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| But, Mr. Troyer, this legislative delegation, what is that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:32| There is an office that is led by Patsy Miller who helps to coordinate activities with our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:41| and state senators and helps communicate that information to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| and from the county and the state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| Does the state representatives pay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| The county makes the conscious decision to choose to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| It's a one-person office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| We're paying $66,857 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| That's including retirement and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| I think that's money well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| In this budget year, how much of this fund balance that we're taking out, how much of it is for one-time funding purposes only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| How much of it is ongoing expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| It seems to me like we have a lot of ongoing expenses here because every year we have to keep digging in more into our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| I'd like to say right off the bat, out of what's proposed, the $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| $9 million right off the bat is coming for a repayment of debt principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| And I think we would all agree that that would be a good use of money as to let's take some money, one-time money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| and pay it against our debt principle and feel real good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| And that brings our number down from 20 to 11, which is the same number as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| Also, I do want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| How much of that 11 is ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| From the $11 million, I would characterize that or present that as a way of worst case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| because what we're not including in this $11 million is how much is going to be turned back at the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:18| and how much will be turned back at the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| So we have two fiscal years that are going to help moderate those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| What we try to do is just say, here's some numbers that we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| Here's where we are budgeted, but we're going to be better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Like, for instance, we had proposed in the current budget year that we're going to use $6 million out of the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| We're going to come out at least to probably $3 million better than that in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| And I can look to see that we're going to come out better than what's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| We tried to present a worst case scenario, and I feel very comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| We've been over this in detail with our bond rating agencies, and they are comfortable with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| Would you say, then, how this $11 million at $10.6 million of it is for ongoing expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| Well, you can take right off the bat, you can take our school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| We have presented a number that's $5 million, and our school board has come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| no, they think the number will be no more than 2.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| And they're already on record as saying that we're going to be better than what's presented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| So I feel very comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| But if this is an ongoing expense, we're going to have to come up with money next year to fund it, are we not, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| That's what I'm trying to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| I think our relevant number, the one that we need to talk about the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| I'm asking you, are we going to have to come up funding for these next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| I'm not talking about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Are we going to have to come up with ways to fund these ongoing expenses next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| We're not going to have to have any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| None of this is ongoing expenses, and this is one-time expenses, what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| Next year is next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| This will fund this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Next year's budget will have to include a proposal to fund next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| And probably like we've had to do for the last three or four years, keep dipping into our fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| Our debt service is up to $66 million now, and our fund balance hasn't grown that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| One of the things that you'll see is I don't think we should tax to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| I don't think we should either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| I think we need to stop spending money so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| I think we have a very conservative proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| It's only going up 1.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| I think that's the lowest increase in many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| And I think that's been a very responsible way to present our proposed spending plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| I think one of the things that we can be thankful for, and one of the things I am thankful for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| is that we're able to continue to provide services in this economic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| We're not having to lay anybody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| And, you know, right now the public needs our health department more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| It needs our libraries more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| It needs our schools more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| It needs our law enforcement more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| And we're able to continue to provide those services at a very, very conservative 1.1% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| And I feel thankful that we're able to present that and not lay anybody off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| Why in some of these departments are we funding them more than they're even asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| I'd be glad to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| One of the things that we wanted to do right off the bat when we started to put this budget together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| was that we did not want to lead people into the expectation that there would be additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| We wanted everybody to know this is a tough budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| Don't expect any more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Now, outside of that, and so we had those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| We had those conversations with every single department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| Since that time, we finalized numbers for health insurance, workers' comp, general liability, and space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| Some of those numbers are slightly up from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| People don't, you know, individual departments don't budget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| We budget that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| We have provided for increases in those areas that are really outside of a departmental control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| What's this official expense we have down here, officials' expense for $30,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Primarily that's used for commissioners' dues to National Association of Counties and commissioners' travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:25| $30,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| I think that needs to be cut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I don't think we need to be traveling around here right now in this day and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| This audit commission, $260,000, $924,000, what's that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:40| I'm glad you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| We are thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| We are appreciative of this commission's action and forward thinking in appointing the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:51| We feel like the audit committee would have better served the county a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| and we're happy to support the work of the audit committee, and we think it needs to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| What are the funds to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Currently what our expectation would be is that currently the audit function of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:14| is performed by the internal audit group, and that would certainly be an option for the audit committee to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:22| Is it for any kind of salaries or anything, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| We calculated that based on the internal audit group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| John, if I could just interject real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| I believe the $260,000 was the amount of the internal auditor's budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| Is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Yes, slightly higher than that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| I mean, really, what we're doing is we're taking internal audit budget and putting it under the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| That's just a shift from one column in the ballot sheet to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| It's Mr. Wall's and his staff's payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| That's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| I just feel like we're pushing this too strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| I just sat down here a while ago and just ran through some things here because I just found out today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| that there was going to be a big push on for this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| and I feel like for some reason there's something there that we're pushing this too fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| Mr. Pinkston, I offered after our last meeting for you to come and spend whatever time you needed to in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| You have real good spin, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| You have to take me up on my offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| But let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Why do we have to pass this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Before, we've always passed it at the last meeting of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| You ask for more time, they're not giving us more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| There's been a number of years where this budget has passed at the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| Since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| But before you were here, there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| I've been here four years, and it hasn't been in the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| And I know last year we asked you to get it to us faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| I believe the mayor presented in April, and I felt very good about that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:06| You ought to go far in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| I was just going to make two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| One is it looks like if we are going to go ahead and discuss the budget today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| that there will be a lot of amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| And if we're not careful by the time we're finished, there will be 15 or 20 on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| This is a procedural question to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Are we going to vote on these amendments individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| or will we vote up or vote down on the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| I think what Commissioner Lutho is adding those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| What amendments are people saying he's adding to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| He has one amendment, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| If I could add, Mr. Chairman, if, like Commissioner Broll has asked for an amendment of $8,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| and if there's no objection from the second, which I believe Commissioner McKenzie seconded the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| and then if there's no objection by the full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| then I'll be happy to add that to my motion, and then we don't have to vote on that as a separate item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| If there's an amendment that there seems to be objections, either myself or the second or other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| then we would vote on that amendment as a separate amendment to add it back into the full body that we would vote on at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:27| The only reason I'm asking this is that we could very well end up with 15 or 20 or 30 of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| and, you know, we may want to vote on some of these amendments separately rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| That's why I would say if there's objections by commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| then I'm apt to allow that to be voted on by the commission instead of just simply adding that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| If there's objections, we have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| And really just to address Commissioner Pinkston, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| he could make a motion that we delay this until June the 4th and we could vote on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| And we could, and we could just move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| It would have to be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Yes, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| You do have the option to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we delay this until after June the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| Are you wanting to do all budgetary items, Paul, or do you just want to do these each one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Or do you want to go ahead and make your motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Just defer to the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| You're talking about all items, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| All items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| 802 through 808, I suppose it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| I was actually going to make the substitute motion before Paul did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| I don't like the idea of us amending this budget significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| and there's some concerns that I have with the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| I'm sure that everyone like me has been getting a lot of calls about property appraisals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| and there's a significant number of property appraisals that are probably going to have to be readdressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:10| They're short-staffed, very short-staffed compared to other metropolitan areas their size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| and their software is antiquated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| By any standard you use, it is antiquated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| My cell phone has more processing power than the software that they're using to assess properties within Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:35| and I think that that's one of the reasons why we have a lot of problems in Knox County with the property assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:44| This go-around is we're using wore-out software that's no longer supported by the manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| I also have concerns that I have brought to the mayor time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| I've talked to Mr. Troyer many times about is they have completely written out the film commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4795)|
| 1:20:03| I think an area this size that has as much digital television production as we have in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| I believe that we need a film commission in some form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| You know, I've talked to them on numerous occasions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| They still have not budgeted anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| They've not told me what we're going to do about whether we're going to fund the film commission as it exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| or whether we're going to give the duties of the film commission to another entity like tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| And I had hoped that by next month when we have our meeting on the 4th that they would have these issues worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:43| and I would be ready to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Today I can't vote on the budget, and I certainly don't want to make amendments to the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| and say just throw out some raw number for film commission and for the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| I know the assessor is talking about he needs another $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| I don't think that's a realistic expectation with today's budget crunch, but I don't know another number to throw out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:12| So if I had to throw one out today, I would be wanting to amend this budget to the tune of about $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| $100,000 for film commission, and $200,000 for the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| And we haven't even decided what the film commission is going to look like the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| So I think we've got a lot of work to do, or I think the mayor's office has a lot of work to do to address these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:36| And rather than ask for $300,000 worth of amendments, I would prefer to delay this budget until early next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:45| give these folks time to come up with what numbers are really necessary to address these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Eric, could you step up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| While Eric is coming, Mr. Law Director, if you'll help me on this, I'm going to do a loose hold disclaimer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| that I, too, serve on several boards that are receiving money and or carry several other people's insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| but still going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Do I state that correctly, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Eric, while you're coming, you know, we're talking about a lot of these people want to add more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| I mean, I wish we could give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| How much was asked for altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Close to $3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| And we have a million to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| And all of them are deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Like I say, I serve on several boards that didn't receive, that aren't receiving a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| And I just feel that your group that you did, you do a great work in the way that you allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| and the panels that we pick as commissioners serve on those panels, make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| And here we're going to be jumping because some of the panels had maybe 20 groups in a panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| and maybe the top three or four get picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| And if we're saying, oh, let's pick number 13 down here that didn't get anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I don't feel guilty or I feel guilty giving number 13 money when we should have been getting number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| or five, the ones that came in second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| So that's where I've got heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| I don't know if you want to explain some of that to the group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| But I just, in fairness to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Well, Eric Oakland, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| You know, what we did is we had $3 million in requests, like Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| It was a tough decision that these citizens had to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| You know, me personally, I would have loved to have $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| And, you know, that way everybody goes away happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| But that's just not the situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| These citizens were asked to review the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| Each agency had an opportunity to come down and give their best pitch, put their best pitch forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| We mainly do that because since we're the authors of the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| if we left out a crucial question to ask or the agency didn't have an opportunity to explain what it is they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:10| that's their chance to come in and say, you know, I wrote this in the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| but I need to tell you this is what we do or, you know, bring down visual aids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| you know, stuff that's not in the application, the standardized application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| Then the citizens after that meeting go back and rank from 1 to however many they had in their group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| 1 to 20, 1 to 32, whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| Then we, you know, compiled the rankings and it went kind of like a golf score at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| The lowest is the highest is the best score on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| Then we applied the money to the, gave the money to the panelists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| and just to try to spread the money around as best we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| And given the feedback we got from surveys from citizens, agencies, from last year's process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5095)|
| 1:25:04| everybody unanimously said they would like to see more agencies get funded at lesser amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| So we said the top three ranked in each category will get 100% of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| Everybody after that gets half of what they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| And when the money dried up, the money dried up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| And that last person kind of got some weird amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| But, you know, that's kind of the way it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| How many groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| I forgot to bring the sheets with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| There were five different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| Of the five different groups, how many were total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| How many people were requesting money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| And we funded how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| I had this committed in memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| I think it was about 104 and we gave somewhere around 66, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| We had about 104 requests and 66 we were able to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| With about half the money we had from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| It just, you know, and I can mention several nonprofits that I serve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| and we can ask for more money for things in the seventh district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| but I don't want to bump the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| I think we're going to start something here of public outcry saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| you can tell these nonprofits that did not get their money, all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| look what we got from the arts, the film commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| I mean, when the film commission saw they weren't going to get anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| we just got bombarded with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Same thing with several piles, we just got bombarded with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| But the other people that didn't get, we didn't hear from those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| And if it's going to be a PR campaign, I think what's going to happen next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| I mean, people don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| All you got to do is bombard the commissioners with money and they'll give in to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| You know, so I've got mixed feelings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| I'd love to give everybody the money, but we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| And I still want to remind the people in the audience and the people at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| folks, the bottom line is the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| That's who's to raise the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| It's not Knox County's job, in my opinion, to fund all these nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| You sign on as a nonprofit, as a board of directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| you're signing on knowing you need to raise money for that nonprofit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| That's the responsibility, and I don't think that's the responsibility of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| Mr. Chairman, a point of order, are we still on the motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5239)|
| 1:27:27| We're having a lot of discussion of individual items which could result in amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| but I don't know whether or are we staying with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| That's a substitute motion, but we still need to get all this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5265)|
| 1:28:02| For the people that the lights are on, are you discussing the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| I have a question about the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| If the substitute motion passes, does that cut off debate of the budget for the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5293)|
| 1:28:23| So we're shutting off debate when we have a meeting that could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| To me, this is the time to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| If we have questions, this is the time to do it instead of cutting off debate until the fourth or the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| It's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Mr. Law Director, we spoke earlier last month or this month in regards to conflict of interest, and we had conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| I guess I need to make the statement that my wife works for the county, but I believe I'm still eligible to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Yes, sir, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Are there any other questions on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Yes, I'd just like to make a comment that's been echoed by a couple of people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| First off, in order to discuss anything, you have to have it motion made and seconded, which is what we did, and it's time for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:17| When Dr. McIntyre came to us the first time, he asked us that if we could at least push their part through early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:26| because they have to get ready for school come August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| It's a little bit different than some of our other, you know, departments that, you know, in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| So we have the folks here today that should be able to answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| We've all had this long enough to be able to look at it and see what questions we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| So I would say let's have the discussion and vote on it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| Commissioner McIntyre, do you have something on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| I want to be respectful of our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| I've got lots of questions about the budget, but I'm ready to vote on whether we should substitute or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| so that hopefully I can get back in and ask my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| I'm going to go ahead and take a vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Then we can go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| Substitute motion was to defer until June the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| What are the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| Three ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| And we're back on the substitute on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| John, Troy, could you come forward for a sec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| I've got a couple of things I want to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| And I guess first, last month my opposition, and I still say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| so I applaud the commission for hopefully voting on this today, was not to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:13| We had a budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| We discussed the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| We discussed it some last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| And then we discussed it again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| And then we discussed it again on the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Possibly going to a second meeting, special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| And then at the last draw discussing at the June budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| That's what I was opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| So I commend the commission for at least considering voting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| Last month I did have some trepidation in terms of being ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:46| But the budget was presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| I applaud the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| I'll say it again, for not inflating the numbers the way I know last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| I think there was some fluff in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| And I think you all did an admirable job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| And I think that helps us to make a decision, to give you what you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| which is a budget at the end of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| But, John, so we spent $66,000 for Patsy Miller, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:16| A one-person office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| A one-person office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| And she takes care of the Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| Communications to and from the Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| We may want to expand that to some of the adjoining counties to the north in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:37| In terms of travel and dues, you know, one, last year we sat here last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5557)|
| 1:32:47| and it was doomsday last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| It was a terrible budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| Your numbers were grossly overinflated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| There's no way we're going to get that revenue in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| And it sounds like we got that revenue in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| We got what we expected plus a little because you had a conservative model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| Is that an accurate statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| Property taxes are already, current property taxes are already more than collected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| what's in the budget, and we have May and June yet to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| So we're going to end up drawing down the general fund by about $3 million less than you anticipated last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| The numbers, that was a debt service budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| But, yeah, it's going to be not as bad as what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Not as bad as what you expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| And I guess I get back to, you know, part of that is you're going to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| and Ms. Miller campaigning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| I have to say it's hard to quantify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| Well, she saved us a million dollars or she brought in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| Same with folks going up to D.C. and trying to get some of this stimulus funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:52| And I think us having affiliations is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| I mean, $30,000 for 19 commissioners to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| I've never traveled on commission, but I appreciate folks going to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| and bringing back information, hopefully bringing back additional sources of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| And I like us having dues in national organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| So I'm kind of against pulling that money out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| But I guess my, you know, only statement, thank you, my only statement as it relates to the budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:30| Commissioner Lambert was throwing out additional 200K, 300K numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| That's troublesome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| You know, I think our budget has been presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| Now, we can nickel and dime it up to $300,000 if we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| But I think we need to be responsible and not just, you know, tax and spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Or if that's what we are, if we need all of this, 300K for this, 200K for that, let's just say it up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5695)|
| 1:35:03| If you all want to raise taxes, we'll vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I don't think that's what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| So these are lean times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| As times get better, we'll adjust accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| So I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| I'd just like to say that I was able to meet with John Troyer on my own time and have him answer all of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:31| We also had two meetings in our district for constituents to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| Other commissioners were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| And John was gracious enough to come to both of those meetings and answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| And the questions that I had about the budget, he was able to answer satisfactorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| I spoke to him about the $10,000 for the cerebral palsy home, which is on Highland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| The reason that I would like to have that funded is because that money allows these people to live independently in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:04| And if they don't get the money, the house closes and these people go into nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| which will end up costing the county more money in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| So it's not only financially wise, it is, in my opinion, the right and moral thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:23| Senior Information Referral Services is not a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| It's part of CAC and was left out of the funding this year, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| And it's a vital, vital service for our seniors, and it needs to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| And $8,000 is not that much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| I did run both of these by Mr. Troyer, and he did say that that money was available from this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:50| So it's not taking anything away from last year or from next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| We can fund it with this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| So I would like for those two things to be thoughtfully considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| And I've done my homework, and I'm prepared, and I'm ready to vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:14| What were the two items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| Are you talking about what we added to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| Senior Information Referral Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| What was the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| The Cerebral Palsy Home on Highland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Yeah, and I had that within the original, along with the Mother Goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| I just wanted to explain why I felt like those two needed to go ahead and receive some funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| I understand exactly, Larry, what you're saying, and you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| The boards of directors are the ones who need to be doing the fundraising for these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| And I don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| As long as we keep it to a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| I mean, I'm making more work for me because I serve on some of these boards that are not going to receive any money whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| So that's just more money that I've got to help raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| And I do understand how Levy feels about the film commission and the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| but are these not things that we could take up as line item transfers later in the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:12| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| So there's not we don't have to do those today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| We can talk about them next month and do line item transfers if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| Almost every month we amend the budget in some way with some action we do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Do you agree to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Yeah, I already agreed to the I already had the cerebral palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Of course, I had cerebral palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| I had the mother goose with Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| And then I agreed to the senior that she had asked as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| I just have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| We talked about the debt service, the $20 million versus the $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| And you said some of that's from undesignated funds and undesignated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| Can you explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| I know the $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| So explain to me the $8 million left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| Is it designated, undesignated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| And what's it going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| Under the debt service and the general fund, they are different categories of fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| And we designate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| And they would include how much we have set aside for solid waste activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| And that's being spent on solid waste activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| How much we have set aside for ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| And so we're spending that on ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| How much we have set aside for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And so there are several different pieces and parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| And I think the most important ones that we would talk about today would be the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| which is a proposed use of $3 million, and the debt service fund, which is proposed of $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| What is our general fund balance currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| I hadn't looked at the book you gave us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| We started the year at $39 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| We expect to end the year at $39 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| And that would be June 30, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| And then a year from now, what we're proposing is that the number would drop down to $36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| That drop will be offset by how much is turned back this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| And that drop would also be offset by how much is turned back next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| So I don't think it will be as low as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| What do you feel comfortable with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| Do you feel comfortable with $36 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| I mean, I know it's your proposed budget, and we're not going to bring in a whole lot of new money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| Do you feel comfortable with the $36 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| I feel very comfortable with $36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| I think as we look into the future, that's something that the commission can decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| You know, okay, what is the appropriate level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I think $36 works well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| We're going to be able to make this without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| There's no reason why we should need a tax anticipation note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| We'll make it until the tax bills are sent out October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| You know, these are hard times, and we don't want a tax to hold too much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| So the bonds that we – I believe Mr. Shouse is a lot smarter on bonds than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| So the bonds that we did, the $50 million previously three or four months ago, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| Was that the tax anticipation notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| No, those are refinancings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| And so all we're doing is just lowering our interest rate to save money, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| So we're not going to have any tax anticipation notes this year that you're anticipating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| There is a proposal to do a bond anticipation note, but not a tax anticipation note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Let me begin by my disclaimer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| I will be the co-chair of the Dogwood Arts Festival next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| and I think the litmus test is do I receive any benefit from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| Well, I receive a lot of benefit, and then I know I'm helping the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| Other than that, I receive no salary, and I receive no reimbursement for any expenses or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| I get an occasional meal, but that's well within the guidelines of our ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| so I wanted to make sure that I had said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| With regards to the Property Assessor's Office, the Finance Committee last week appointed Commissioners Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| and Commissioners Smith to go by and begin meetings with the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| I was surprised to find that he has employees that do not have phones or computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| I don't know how you do your work when you don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| And so I'm anxiously waiting to see their report, and I think once we get that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| we'll be able to adequately assess the Property Assessor's Office because I agree, he needs more resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| As I said in the last meeting, I think two most important things to people are their family and their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| And so we need to make sure that he has the tools that he needs to make sure that that property is assessed the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| I do have some questions on the budget, and there's Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| And if Hugh Holt would be on deck or someone from the Purchasing Office, I would have a question for him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| First of all, with regards to stimulus money that may or may not be coming from the federal government, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| any of that money being used at all for operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| I know that there have been some things with regards to the police department and hiring new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| Are we looking at maybe some recurring costs down the line if, indeed, these things come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| We are not counting on that in this budget for operations at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| And I would like to speak to the assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| I'm glad you brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| We met last week with the assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| He did indicate a need for some computers and phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| and I feel like those issues can be addressed out of this year's budget without any further action of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| We may present a line item transfer in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| but I feel comfortable that his needs would be able to be addressed with what's already been appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| There has been talk about additional staffing in the assessor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| and I think that's something that we're going to continue to work with the assessor on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| very carefully and deliberately, and we think that's going to take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| and I don't think that needs to affect our vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| The state, and we talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| And, by the way, let me also say that I've had meetings with John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| and we have discussed the budget, and I think I've got most of my questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| But with regards to the state, we had talked last week about the fact that the state may be taking some funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| for example, the trauma center fund, designated funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| The state may put that in a general fund, which would affect UT Hospital, and that's one fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| There are several that they're looking at like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Are we looking at that as possibly affecting this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| depending on what the state does with regards to those designated funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| We have been monitoring that very closely, and we think that at least so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| for everything that we know, that we've represented what's going to happen as we know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:41| So we feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| On this legislative delegation office, is that person a county employee or a state employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| County employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| And can you give me specific examples of what they have done with regards to us and the legislature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| I, too, question $66,000 for a legislative delegation office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| when I believe most people call the individual representatives in their offices in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| or perhaps they have their cell phone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| But I'm just wondering what we do for $66,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| I feel very comfortable with the amount spent, and Ms. Miller is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| One of the things is that there's a lot of different activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:19| because Knox County, the Knox County entity, is many-faceted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| and being able to keep our legislators in touch with the many different pieces and parts of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| and to be able to communicate to and from those legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:40| I think is extremely important, and I feel that's a small amount to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| considering that we get 25 percent of our funding from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| I think our only question might be, should we fund that more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| So really, then, we should be utilizing Ms. Miller more in terms of communicating with the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| Yes, she's a very valuable resource, and we should be thankful she's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| and thankful for that connection to Nashville, because Nashville is so important in our own budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| Let me ask you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| We had asked at our last meeting for the fee offices to send us their salaried positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| and if they anticipated paying any bonuses in the coming budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| I want to make sure that I haven't missed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| We received the school superintendent's list, which we are very appreciative of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| I also have received from Mr. Foster Arnett, our court clerk, his list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| and was very appreciative of his note when he says that he wants to provide us anything we want, anytime we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| I don't recall getting stuff or any information from the other fee offices, but maybe I didn't get it and others did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| I just want to make sure that I haven't missed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| I'm not familiar with what the fee offices may have sent through the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| and we weren't coordinating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| Did any of my fellow commissioners get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| See, I didn't think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| It is reasonable for us to ask for this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| It is not unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| The fact that they chose not to give it to us, I think, is indicative of what has been going on here for the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:19| Editorial comment, end of comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| We do hold the power of the purse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| and the fact that they have chosen not to give us this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| maybe they didn't know they were supposed to, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| Nonetheless, I would just like for the citizens to know that we made a reasonable request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| and that request was not forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| With regards now to the bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| I guess the issue that I have with the bonuses is the fact that everybody is getting the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| and that if you make over $100,000, you get the same amount as somebody who is making $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| Now, I had asked for an analysis of the number of people and the pay categories that they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| Approximately 30% of our employees make between $15,000 and $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| That's about 400-some employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| We've talked about maybe how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| There's really no easy way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I would just make a request that as we go through the year, if we find that things are turning around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| if we find that perhaps things are better, that perhaps we look at for those employees that are the lowest paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| that perhaps we look at maybe giving them an additional $250 toward the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| But, again, let's wait and see how things go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| But addressing these lower paid employees, I think that that's something that we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| I think there's great value to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| And let me also ask this, and let me also say that I understand that this is a contentious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| However, I do believe that I have every right to ask these questions in its regards to take-home vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| How much does it cost for a take-home vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| Let's take out the patrol cars, the police patrol cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Let's take those out of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| There's about 130-some odd vehicles that are basically take-home out of the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:08| What would you say would be the cost of operating a take-home vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| You know, there's a lot of different components to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| I mean, you start with gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| You start with tires, maintenance, the oil changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| You could include depreciation, cost of the car, time of the employee if you wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:31| It would be different for each car, but there certainly is a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| So it would be hard to come in and say it's worth $5,000, $8,000, or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| I mean, there's a lot of different companies that would put a number to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| and I think the $5,000 to $8,000 range is within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| With regards to the gasoline, when people purchase gasoline, do they get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| Is it by individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| Is it by department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| How would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| At the service center, it's individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| And so when a person would fill up, then that individual puts in their employee number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| and it's tied to an individual employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| There is a contract with the local service center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| and if they happen to use the gas cards, then those are tied generally to specific employees also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| So we could theoretically come in and say, all right, if we're looking for employee so-and-so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| we could really actually check and see how much gasoline they've used in the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| The records would be in a couple of different places, but they could certainly be accumulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| and it's certainly all public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| With regards to these take-home vehicles, it's interesting that we provide a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| We provide, as you mentioned, the gasoline, the oil, the maintenance, tires, insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| We also provide them with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| It's interesting to note that I asked for a report to be pulled on the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| with take-home vehicles who pay parking, and there are eight of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| and most of them are in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| We do have a few others, but out of 130-some-odd vehicles, I guess, and this may have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6663)|
| 1:51:12| only eight are paying for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| So basically I think it would be fair to say that the taxpayer is also paying for their parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| which would be about $30 a month right now as it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| That's the current charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| And do we have a vendor who washes these vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| Do we have somebody that you can take them down and run them through the car wash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| There is an outstanding bid, and there is a provided vendor, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| How much is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| Right offhand, I wouldn't be able to tell you that, but it is bid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| and it's a matter of bid, and it's per wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| So anybody who has a take-home vehicle can go to the vendor and get their car washed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:57| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| I had maybe one other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| However, I'll hold my time, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Perhaps I'll have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Commissioner Allman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| John, I appreciate you showing up at the Time Warped Tea Room and chatting about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| and I also appreciate Phil Ballard taking the time to show Commissioner Armstrong, Mr. Smith, and I around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:29| Someone was asking for a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| I hope you don't mind if I give a brief oral report about what we discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| What we discovered was an office with some talented employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| dedicated people working against an antiquated system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| They simply don't have the resources to do the job properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| and that's true both in the office and in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Especially the problem is in the field because they spend a lot of time with the inadequate electronic capacity to upload material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:59| to record material in the field in such a manner as to efficiently get to a location and determine where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:06| They frequently get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| They frequently don't have the records they need despite the best procedures under awkward circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| I noticed Commissioner Armstrong is nodding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| He probably noticed that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| Commissioner Smith did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| I'd like to call Phil to the microphone, if you don't mind, to give a little bit more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| and then I would like to make a motion related to both his office and some other savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| And Commissioner Armstrong, you can speak after I do if you would like to on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:35| I guess my name is Phil Ballard, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| It's good to see you back, Tank and fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| I almost forgot that I'm a property assessor now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| but I do appreciate the time that Mark and Larry and Mr. Armstrong came by the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| We do have some significant issues in the computer system and staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| And I have met with Mr. Coyier, and we did have a two-hour meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:05| I could go into a lot of details today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| They have indicated to me, as Amy has, that some of these might be better addressed in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:19| For me, we'll see how little bit more money that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| But we do have some critical shortages, and other than that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:33| To answer your questions, I'll let others speak that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| I guess it would be the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| Yes, if you don't mind, I will make my motion and then have Commissioner Armstrong speak to what he discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:45| My motion is as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| In the budget currently, we have $350,000 for Innovation Valley, $150,000 for the Chamber Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| $900,000 for the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| Vital as these are, it seems that this is the time for a private business to step up to its role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| and require less government assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| I was thinking that this money would be cut in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| The savings of $675,000, we would give $210,000 to the immediate needs of the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| to get his office to the point where he can collect the money our county needs to collect and assign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| Well, assign the value to the money we get to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| Then the remaining $465,000 to the schools, which I calculate can have them hire between 9 and 10 more of our laid-off teachers back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:33| I think that's a reasonable motion, and I will make it in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| Mr. Harmon, can you comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| I think that would be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I make it in the form of an amendment to the item under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| Can you repeat the numbers, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| The numbers would be to reduce Innovation Valley, Chamber Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| and Development Corporation to half their current allocation, which is a savings of $675,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| $210,000 would go to the property assessor for immediate equipment needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| and $465,000 to schools for the rehiring of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| Well, they would put it to whatever purpose they've been indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| but they told us that any extra money would go to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| And I would make that as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| Could we vote on that separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| I was going to say that that would need to be voted on separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| I don't mind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| I probably did need a second somewhere along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| Did someone second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| Well, I think what has to happen, right, Commissioner Lutho would have to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| I'm not accepting that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| I think that's something that's going to have to be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| We can't have two motions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| He's asking for an amendment to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| but we would vote on that as a separate amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| but he would still need a second to his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| Does he have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| I'll second to get on the floor and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| So now we're just speaking to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| Now we're speaking to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| And, Commissioner Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| if you want to talk further about the property assessor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| I said I don't know if I can usurp the power of the chair to recognize you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| but you were there, and I think you're logical to speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| At the will of the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| First off, we did our homework, and I have no problem with voting on the budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| I'd like to thank Troyer for coming out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| and answering a lot of questions and meeting with at least me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| Addressing the specific thing as Commissioner Harmon brought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| we met with the property assessor, Ballard, and went through the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| and looked at what they went through, visited their offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| which are in many cases not recognizable as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| It looks like an empty room, and it's just where people sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7085)|
| 1:58:09| So we do need some resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| and in talking to the mayor's office and Mr. Troyer about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| I think that we can come to a solution to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| The other side is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| I think that we need the motion on the floor was dealing with computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| I think we need computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| but I also think if we're going to meet the state standards, my understanding, Phil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| if you wanted to add to this comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| that we're going to need personnel as badly as we need technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| at least one, two, or three in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| If we're going to start splitting hairs with other people, then we might need a blend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| and that's why I wasn't quick to jump on a second, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| What probably we need to do is send out a request for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| invite several people to bid and others as it's with and get with Dick Moran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| and the people that would sell those equipment and our own ideals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| to see maybe if IT can support a lot of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| and that probably should go out in the near future just for information purposes only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| so that we do know the dollar amount that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| As far as the staffing needs, yes, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| It's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| The 200,000 would probably staff three and put the computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| would add three to the staff and put computers and telephones on the desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| Again, you know, it's the will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| I am willing to work with the administration and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| I also have a team in office that needs my support and your all's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| You know, I went from Ballard on the Mimic to winning with teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| I consider all the ones that I've mentioned in this room as teamwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| and I wouldn't want to alienate any of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| And so I'll be glad to answer any other questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| Well, I appreciate the time to let me speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| but the most important thing is we have the big budget to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| I believe that the mayor's office just said we will hopefully take care of the telephones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| and the immediate needs of the staff that's currently present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| and maybe we can work through these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| I'm holding everybody to the fact that this was a priority in my heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| and I expect that the property's assessor's office to be addressed successfully in this next physical year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| whether it's in this direct budget passing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| or in some future line item transfers and amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| And so I'll be supporting you on that, Phil, as this progresses forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7244)|
| 2:00:50| I want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| And that's all I have at this time, and I hope that we'll be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| for those of you who deferred and elected not to speak on the budget during your committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| today's the day for you to ask the questions because the rest of us have spent our committee meetings working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:06| and worked in the field on it and did our homework on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| and I have no problem bringing it to the floor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| Are there any other questions on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| Can someone from Development Corporation please come up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:33| I mean, I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:34| I guess while he's coming up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| I do want Mr. Ballard's office to be funded and taken care of and brought into this century, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| But now is not the time to cut business recruitment, Innovation Valley, and the Chamber Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:54| because if there are businesses relocating and businesses starting in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7314)|
| 2:02:01| we certainly don't need to shortchange them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| Your current budget is $900,000 a year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| I'm Todd Napier, Development Corporation, Knox County, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| Thanks, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| What are the implications of a half of a budget for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:27| Half of a budget basically would put us out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| And your job is to help facilitate development recruitment along with the Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| to infrastructure needs, things like that, for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| I mean, I don't want to underemphasize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| In essence, we are the county's arm of economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| Parks and Rec is your Parks and Rec arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| You've got health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| It was the way it was set up back in 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Without the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7376)|
| 2:02:58| and the economic development portion of the Knoxville Chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| Knox County does not have an economic development effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| And I just want to emphasize, as much as I want to see Mr. Ballard's office modernized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| I hope we can find the money elsewhere than stop recruiting business and stop recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7393)|
| 2:03:21| We've got empty business parks, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| We've got to fill them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| And we're not going to fill them up if nobody's making phone calls, nobody's sending out letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| And I think this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| This is the bad part of the budget to cut to pay for this certain area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| And I'd like to find another way to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| But I'm against taking these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Innovation Valley runs through the heart of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| And I can't support not supporting business growth in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:52| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Yeah, I ditto to a lot of what Mr. Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| I am all for getting some funding for the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| I think it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| But I think this is the wrong way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| And I'm sure that next time I see my friend Lloyd Darty, he's going to hit me in the head with his bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:15| But I just can't see cutting business recruiting at a time like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| Back during the Great Depression, and that's the real Great Depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| not this little bump in the road that we're in today, going into the Depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| the Ford Motor Company sold the majority of automobiles sold in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| They cut advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Times were tough and they cut advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| Their competitor, General Motors, continued to advertise throughout the Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:48| And by the end of the Depression and leaving at the end of World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| General Motors was selling the majority of the automobiles in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:58| and Ford was selling about what General Motors had before the economic downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| Advertising works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| The way we advertise our community is through the chamber partnership and through Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| And, again, I'm sure I'm going to get hit in the head with a bell for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| But that is how we advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| And I don't think we need to cut our advertising during tough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| I agree with Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| I would like very much to find a way to help Phil Ballard fund this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| I think we may be a little bit premature with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:36| Given the comments that Mr. Troyer has made, I think we can find a way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7536)|
| 2:05:41| But I think now in this particular budget is not the place to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:45| I think we can address this later, and I expect that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| Is there any other questions on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| Mr. Chairman, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| If you don't have it, we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| I just want to make a comment, is that I absolutely feel that we need to give Phil Ballard all the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:11| A lot of letters, just like he's had a lot of complaints about the way the reappraisal has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| And it's obviously this is something that's very important to the community on how their property is valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:22| We want to give you all the tools that you need to do it right, the infrastructure, you know, whatever you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| This is something that is of interest to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| And once you determine whether we need new software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| we've already heard that the mayor is going to support you in adding some infrastructure to your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| But I do think that this commission will support you just as much as you can on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| because I think we've all learned that this is very important to the community and the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| The second comment I have is that I, in general, share very much Commissioner Harmon's desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:59| to help the educational part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| It's an essential part of our community to have our children just as well educated as they can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| so they can be competitive in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| But I do agree with my colleagues that sit to the left and with Commissioner Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| that I think that we do have to maintain our presence in the, really, it's a national,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:24| maybe even an international presence in order to attract the type of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| and industry here that are the jobs of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| And I would like to point out that the chamber does provide dollars to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| They were very much a proponent of the Knox Achieves, which helps many students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| And I don't recall the name of the program, but I believe it was the chamber that's provided some of the software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| so we can measure the progress of students as they go through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| And they've also been very vocal proponents of the workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| which really deals with education also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| So a lot of the dollars that do go to the chamber do aid in the education process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| and they are very much a supporter of the education in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| As much as I'd like to support this, my feeling is that I don't want to appropriate money for Phil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:27| until he knows exactly how much he needs and for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| At that point, I think if you come before the commission, you'll find us united| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| in helping you get what you need to run your office the way you need to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| I don't like cutting any department's budget in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| My feeling is that that's just a little unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| I wouldn't mind seeing the budgets cut maybe 10 percent and that money being put towards education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| because if we don't have a well-educated workforce, there's no point in recruiting businesses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| And I do appreciate that the chamber contributes to the education of Knox County students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| but we have a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| So that's my feeling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| Who else wanted to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| John Troyer, just a clarification, you had mentioned that you felt like that you would be able to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| the phone and the computer issue right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:29| Right away, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:30| I feel very comfortable we can address the phone and computers right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| We have worked with and we're going to continue to work with the IT people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| and the assessor's office to bid through the software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| That needs to go through a process, and we can come back with a hard number and a hard bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| for the commission to consider at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| We are committed to work with him because he needs the tools to be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| and I would expect it to be sometime after January 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| and he'll have a proposal for the commission to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| and I think we can talk about funding at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| The personnel, we have been through a number of issues with personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| and the assessor has restructured job responsibilities, job duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:14| We've been working very closely with him on that and to get that in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:18| and he still has a couple of open items, and we're committed to working with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7818)|
| 2:10:24| and I think we'll come back probably with a line item transfer later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:29| So, Phil, let me ask you, you've got your phones, you've got your computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| you're getting your software, they're looking at your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| Are you satisfied with that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| Because you mentioned teamwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| I think we're all wanting to help you and get you what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| You know, I really don't want to bust the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| You know, I've got a lot of other things ahead of you here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| but I do want a lot of things to be going forward in motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| and I look to continue with the administration on sharing a lot of these ideals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| but I think that I do need to bring it back, at least the staffing part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| no later than the January meeting and see where we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7862)|
| 2:11:07| You know, I'm going to play the hand that I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| We'll play it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| But we do need the number of people in the field that can look at all the partials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| I think the county demands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| It's going to be a take-home vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Commissioner Brown, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| Well, most of what I was going to say was just addressed to remind us that it's already been stated numerous times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:29| that we can take care of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| But one thing we've got to keep in mind, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| is that if we don't get that taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| he's not able to assess the properties at the proper rate for us to set the proper tax rate for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| So it's imperative that we get this fixed as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| As far as education is concerned, as mentioned, the chamber, Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| you brought up the fact that bringing in businesses without educated people to run them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| A lot of these businesses have their own educational programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| And as Lumpy said, you know, if you don't advertise, you snooze, you lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| That's the way it is, particularly in rough times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| So if you don't go out there and get it, it's not going to come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| Are there any other questions to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| Please, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| Phil, this may not be a very helpful line of questioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| but I feel like it needs to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| How long has it been since you've known you were going to have to do an assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:39| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| Of the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| You were going to have to assess Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| You knew that when you got in there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| How long did the office know that that was going to be an activity for this next year, for this past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:55| It's a scheduled activity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| It seems like your office was woefully unprepared for that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| Is it not, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| It's from 1-1 of 05 to 1-1 of 09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:16| It was three years underway before I got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| Beginning in October, after the certified tax rate and you received your bills in the mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| basically it was a drive-through of the outside appraisers to really say we've looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8007)|
| 2:13:40| and there's no other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| They're also looking at a lot of condos at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| but really the process that was in place for 190,000 parcels from October to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:54| What I did, because that's data driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| I added a couple of weeks to try to get as much data as I could into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| And that's by the eyes that are in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| John alluded to the fact that possibly some of the problems just due to the way that you've restructured the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:13| Have you added employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| Net?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Actually, when I started there were 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| What I did was allow the county to use from five different by attrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:27| We were allowed, I allowed the county to use that, but they do need to hire those back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| Because what we did is brought people over from the old courthouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| merged them to see how much through cross-training and maybe, you know, not have to hire additional employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:43| Now, if you want to get really down to the facts, in 1997 we had approximately 158,000 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:51| Today we have approximately 198,000, 40,000 more parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| If you go by the state recommended 4,500, then that means since 1997 we should have added nine employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8096)|
| 2:15:06| to look at the number of parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:09| You know, that wasn't done, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| But from that time we've got more traffic, more land splits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| There's a whole lot of things that could and should have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| but you sort of get into a little political battle between the past property assessor and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:28| Well, I appreciate Dr. Harmon's motion, his amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| As far as ill-prepared or different, it's the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| We have five people in the supervisory positions that's been through six reappraisals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:44| One was in 1974, and it was hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| Well, it would just be, it would seem, like I wonder about the last reappraisal that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:53| Were there people sitting in offices without phones and computers at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| And I assume they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| And so we've dealt with an archaic practice for quite a while, evidently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:05| and now we're trying to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| It's in excess of a decade, especially the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:10| And the reason that you're all getting more phone calls and stuff, let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| I was the first one to put a website on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| It's very elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| But I did that so that the first time in the county history we took the appeal process off-site and online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:25| We had 3,200 hits online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| We had 16,062 people that appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| Part of that was my leadership in that I wanted everybody to have a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| other than coming up here to the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| I encouraged people to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| We did nine, 10, 12 off-sites, appeared in front of three dozen presidents of homeowners groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:47| Republican clubs, the tea room, as Amy and them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| We did everything that we could to encourage people to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| because the first phase is you get your notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| The second phase is discovery where people show us maybe things that we've missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| And people have all walked slides, talents has been down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| We've got a tremendous feedback from the people that have visited with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| And, you know, I don't know how much of that questions or how much I got off track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| But, you know, I don't know that this office has been inadequate in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| Well, I think you sense that there's a collective will here to do what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| to help you get through this, and so we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| And this is one thing when you look at staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| I have seven guys that are retirement age or past retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| And, you know, I think the strength when you're understaffed is your experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| And if we've got to be able to capture that in technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| because if you go out and hire a certified appraiser, that's $70,000 to $110,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| And if you want to talk about busting the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| we go along with my recommendations for that I think I can grow them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| and get them there in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| And I agree with my colleagues here about the business practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| the economic development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| I just, although Dr. Harmon's got a good suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| I don't think, I think that would be very difficult for me to cut the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| of Development Corp., Chamber, Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Those are essential places that contribute in a wide variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| But I do agree with the principle of it, especially there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| I think the schools are making an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| They probably already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| Not to say that we don't need to reinstate some of those teachers that have been cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| And I think that those are still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| that's still a possibility within the budget that's been presented by the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| Commissioner Strickland, can I say a couple of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| Commissioner Boyles, I want you to know that I did meet with John Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| his ever commissioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| Larry, I really appreciate your stand on these community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| As John Madison once said, and I may not have this quote correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:06| for the sake of me I cannot see anywhere in the Constitution that I should give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:12| to benevolence committees taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| These people, you know, if you're really working and sincere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| a lot of them should be working for less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| We've got them coming up here for $188,000 a year, and I've been looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| Some of them, it seems like what we give them, that's the amount the person over it gets in the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| Another thing is, John Troyer, do we have any lobbyists in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:45| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| You have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| Should they not keep us involved in these things that are going to involve us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| that this legislative director is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| They work very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:04| I think they have two different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| The lobbyists are stationed in Nashville working with other legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:13| that are not necessarily Knox County legislative delegation, but the whole state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:19| And I envision our office, Knox County Office of Legislative Delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:26| is working with specifically the people who are elected by Knox County and for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Let me finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| I won't say another word after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| How many hours does she work a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:41| How long does she work a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| She works full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| Full-time all year long, even when they're out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| That's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| Are there any other questions to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Can't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:02| And make a substitute when we already have an original and then an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| Oh, I thought this was not an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| It's an amendment, but we already have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| I will withdraw my amendment in favor of Commissioner Boyle's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| You can always withdraw yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Are you withdrawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| In favor of Commissioner Boyle's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| Why didn't you do that an hour ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| I was waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| Because I was just making sure you guys weren't going to go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| You weren't going to go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Commissioner Boyle's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Well, his second needs to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| I think Larry just did, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| I think when you discuss it some more, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| I think we need a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| Let's see what Amy's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| I think I know what she's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| I think Brad wants to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| My substitute amendment would be that we take 10% of the budgets for those three groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8512)|
| 2:22:01| and redirect them to the school system so they can rehire three more teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| What three groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| Innovation Valley, the Chamber, and the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| It would be $135,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| So none of that would go to the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| It would all just go to the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| Yes, and it's only $135,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| It's not a terrible amount, but it would be enough to rehire three teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| Of course, we can't tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| We can just put it in their bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| No, but they said if they had extra money, they would direct it towards teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| Just as Phil is relying on your assurances, we'll rely on the school district's assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:46| Do we have a second to a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8572)|
| 2:23:01| I'd like to hear from Mr. McIntyre on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8586)|
| 2:23:23| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, what would you like to hear from me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| Is this, I mean, are you asking us for more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| I keep seeing commissioners trying to get more money into your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| Is this something you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| I've not been asked to do this by anyone from the school system or the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:45| This is just I would like to see them hire three more teachers, and this is a way to try to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:54| Well, I mean, I understand what you're trying to do, but it's going to carry a lot more weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| if Dr. McIntyre asks us to do this than if a fellow commissioner asks us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| I mean, I haven't, the calls that I've gotten from school board members have been support the budget as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:11| and, you know, I mean, there was a lawsuit, you know, involving county commission and school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:19| and so I have a very hands-off approach to education matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:24| There was a lawsuit before we were on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| The commission was trying to meddle in school board business quite frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| and I think Mayor Ragsdale was on the commission at that time, and out of respect for that lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:40| and the way the courts ruled on that, you know, you'll notice I've got a very hands-off approach to the education budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:48| So if I'm going to do something that alters the education budget, I want the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:53| or I want the superintendent to ask me to first, not a fellow commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:57| And in no disrespect to you, it's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:04| Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| Well, when I met with you last, I think I left you with the thought that if there were additional resources that were available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| to be appropriated to the school district, we would certainly welcome them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| And I guess that perspective has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| We certainly would welcome additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| It's been a difficult budget development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| But, of course, the task that you all have is a difficult one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| and that is to balance the relative priorities and needs of the various organizations within your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| So I think you have to ask yourself, you know, where you think those dollars will be best spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| Of course we would welcome additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| Of course we would use them wisely and make sure that those tax dollars are invested appropriately in the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:51| The question for you is where is the relative priority for you in terms of the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| and the incremental nature of the dollars that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| You're talking about $135,000 out of a $375 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| So that question is to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| Would we welcome additional resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Of course we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| Now I'd like to hear from Mr. Edwards on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| And before I leave the podium, I would also be remiss if I did not say that the chamber does do a good deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| as has been noted, to support public education in Knox County and its improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| And I want to do whatever I can for public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:32| But what I'm seeing here is $125,000 is a very small portion of your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8792)|
| 2:26:40| but it's a very large portion of Mr. Edwards' budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| And if Mr. Edwards says that, you know, that his office can survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| and do their job of keeping businesses in Knox County growing, then I may be inclined to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:57| But, you know, do I want to rob one vital entity of 10 percent of their budget to add a small percentage to another entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:07| And that's what I'm having a real problem with as much as I support the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| It's not actually coming all out of his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| It's across three different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| That are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| I mean, you know, he's on development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| He's in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| I mean, you know, he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Let's let Mr. Edwards speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| Last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:39| It was 14 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| It's a relative thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| Somewhere in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Down yonder will work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| I'm from Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| 14 through 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:53| Like this year, last year's budget was very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| And the historical amount that the county had funded the chamber and the development corps and innovation valley was cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8876)|
| 2:28:09| And fairly significant to what the city had historically paid as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:15| So this year we're living with what has already been diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:23| And it's a function of, you know, it's not like can you come in and turn on the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| That stuff is covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:32| It's how much work product can you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| How many contacts can you make, not only with the industry consultants, but specific companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:43| And how are you competing with those municipalities that we're competing against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:50| And there is not a municipality in the United States that, one, isn't hyper-focused on getting what jobs are being grown today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8930)|
| 2:29:06| and there's still jobs that are being grown, but also positioning themselves very strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:13| and with workforce and with the skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8953)|
| 2:29:16| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8956)|
| 2:29:17| It's not a chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| It's the whole flock and it's the whole batch of eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| We're going to have to do the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| But if we brought raw in our horns right now, we will do so at our own risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:31| And, you know, if you look at our we're doing pretty good in a percentage-wise of unemployment compared to the rest of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:41| but that's still about 16,000 people who are out of work in Knox County and about that number in the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:49| which drives a whole lot of business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:57| As far as the development corporation, they are extremely hamstrung right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:06| but so is the work program of both the Chamber and Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| It's not the program that was originally adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| It has been scaled back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| We're still making a whole lot of contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:26| Right now I think we have maybe 11 prospects that are somewhere in the look pretty good and maybe to take an act of God to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:39| But, you know, there's still 11 prospects and I would put that up against any municipality like ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| So I think things are as good as it's just nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| We're all in our horns right now at this time or ever for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:56| I don't know if I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| I want to emphasize what Mr. Edwards just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| In fact, if they are successful in their endeavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| and do attract new enterprise and business to Knox County, we, in fact, grow the tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:20| and that extra revenue that we all hope for begins to materialize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| And that's where I think we need to keep our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:28| So I'm troubled with this and I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| Mr. Lama, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| No, I'm not for this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| Yours is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| No, I don't want to lose my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| I'm going to leave my light on, but I don't want to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9106)|
| 2:31:49| That's me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| I don't want to lose my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9110)|
| 2:31:54| We have a motion on the floor to take 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| An amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| An amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9120)|
| 2:32:02| Amendment, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Amendment to the motion to take 10 percent from the three entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| Wait a minute, I meant no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9133)|
| 2:32:17| No, I changed my vote to no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| Who were the ayes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| He was both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| Two ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| Motion fails 17-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9147)|

| 2:32:51| Are we back on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| I remember the other question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:53| It was for purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| I don't see Hugh Holt here, but I'm sure there's a capable representative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9174)|
| 2:33:01| There was a report about tea cards, travel cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| And under the travel cards, there was a report that it was a $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| Would you explain to me exactly what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| Is it a limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| I don't get the $10,000 about the travel cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:24| Well, unfortunately, I'm not that close to the travel card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| Mike Reeves, Knox County, purchasing 1,000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| I certainly can get you an answer exactly what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| and come back to you here in just a few minutes if you'd like, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| If you would, because I'm wondering what the $10,000 is for, why we need $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| It would seem to me that $10,000 for travel is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| And I think that that's just something that we just need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9226)|
| 2:33:49| I'm just asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| I'll defer to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| Commissioner, I'm a little more familiar with these than Mr. Reeves may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| Travel cards essentially are going to be issued to departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| That limit will affect individual departments, like, for instance, the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090526part1?start=9243)|
