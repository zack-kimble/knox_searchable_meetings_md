| 0:01:20| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| We are very excited to present to you these proposed ordinances for your review and your vote on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=83)|
| 0:01:31| Those of you who are in your third year of service to the city know what we have done in the previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=91)|
| 0:01:40| working with consultants and with other cities throughout this state and across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=100)|
| 0:01:49| to try and figure out how we address this problem, vacant and blighted properties, abandoned, vacant, and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| And those of you who were on the campaign trail with me know how big of an issue it was everywhere we went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| So I am going to turn this program over to David Massey and David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| David is the Neighborhoods Coordinator, and David Brace is the Director of Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| They and their colleagues and their departments have done most of the work here in pulling this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| and they will be able to explain it to you best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| But you all know, again, those of you who have been serving know the problem in our neighborhoods because it's rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=147)|
| 0:02:35| So I'm just going to turn it over now, Vice Mayor, to David and David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| Well, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| I'm David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| I'm the Director of Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| I've got Anita Cash here, who's the Zoning Enforcement Inspector for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| and David Massey, who's with the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| So we really appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Obviously, some of you have been on council for a little while, so vacant and blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| and the discussion of that is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| If you've been on the campaign trail, you've heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| So we're going to start out with just kind of defining the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| What is the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| So what are blighted properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| You know, it's a little hard to compare apples to apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| You know, one blighted property in a neighborhood may have certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| You may roll across the street, and there's different conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| but they both have blighting influences on value and they're a nuisance, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| But these are common traits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| This is actually from the city's blight definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| When we use eminent domain through the blight process, this definition applies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| and you can put an or after all of these because it's not all of these, but it's a combination of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| So violates city building code, the property maintenance code or the other codes adopted by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| including fire, plumbing code, electrical code, all those codes that are adopted on the city books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| It's an attractive nuisance for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| That doesn't mean it looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| It means it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Kids, young folks, you know, are attracted to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| They want to go inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| It's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Obviously, since it doesn't meet building codes, it's dangerous for those folks to be inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| It's been declared unfit for human habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| It's a fire hazard or a fire hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| There's no utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Accumulation of trash is a haven for rodents and vermin, tax delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And the owner has failed to take corrective action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Most people in the city take care of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| These are properties where the owner fails to take corrective action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| So, you know, why are these issues for local government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Why is this a problem for the city of Knoxville, for city staff, for city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| One of the main reasons is these properties are often behind in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| And number two, I've underlined decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| These things decrease surrounding property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| And the research tells us that's anywhere from 10% to 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| And it's somewhat insidious because, you know, it starts out as maybe somebody got foreclosed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| and they move out and the bank gets it and it's overgrown and then there's not good maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| So this happens over a 1 to 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| But, you know, I always say, you know, if somebody came into your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| and took the cash equivalent, 30% of the cash equivalent value of your house, you would be outraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| And so that's a huge one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| Not only does that affect our customers, our citizens, our taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| but it affects the city and the city's tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| It requires municipal resources not afforded most customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| So the services we provide these properties, you know, these aren't the day-to-day services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| They're not getting, you know, they're not getting leaf collection and brush collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| These are fire goes out because there's been an arson or there have been homeless folks inside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Police goes out because of drug activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Public service has to mow or clean the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Community development may need to talk about it in staff meetings over two or three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| The community development department may need to put money into acquiring the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| The tax department in both the city and the county have to deal with these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| because they're a rear in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| So not only are they not paying taxes, they're decreasing values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| They're also sucking resources, limited resources, the city, the county, and other municipalities have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| And then the bottom line is they're dangerous to the health and safety of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| the inhabitants sometimes if they're a rental property, if they're occupied by an owner, children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| They attract crime, prostitution, and drug dealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| So that combined is real motivation for us to be proactive in our efforts and not sit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| And so, you know, what are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| They're vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| These are single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| These are commercial multifamily properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| They're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| They're found in all geographic and demographic areas of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| They're not in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| They're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| And I bet every one of you could take me to one right now and say, what's going on with this property right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| Probably more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| There are higher concentrations in the urban core of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| The older portions of the city in areas around that first ring area of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| We know that there's higher concentrations in high rental property or areas of high rental property concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| And it's a little hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| We're working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| One of the other initiatives we're going to talk about kind of at the summary slide at the end is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| really managing the data around these properties is very challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| And so I know Mayor Rojero and her team are really looking at our information systems and how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| is the system that we have in place through Permits Plus and KGIS and the other software system we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| is it effective for us to understand the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| We've done through MPC, we've determined that at any one time there's about 1,000 blighted properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| I can't go pull a report right now easily and tell you exactly where those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| but we know through research that that's about where the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| I've underlined these last three, and these are really more related to what I do every day in public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| but they truly take city resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| Our budget for public service codes enforcement, the nine inspectors in the field, the office support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=464)|
| 0:07:52| that's about a $1.2 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| That's real city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| That's also for the remediation crew, the crew out in the neighborhoods every day and on our streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| mowing lots and tearing down houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| You know, annually we demolish 60 structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| I mean, that's a pull dozer and two or three dump trucks and a couple of workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| We mow 2,400 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| We clean up to 500 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| So, you know, these are real city resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| If we didn't have a dozer out tearing down a house, we would have a dozer maybe building a greenway or a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| So, again, resources taken from the city for those that aren't even providing typically the taxes, the base taxes for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| Annually we bill about $350,000 in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| It's anywhere from three to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| It's about the mid-range depending on the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| We get back anywhere from 10% to 25% of those payments at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| And that's if they're not paid, they become liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| So, and I wanted to just show this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| This is when Mayor O'Hara was the head of community development, the director for community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| She spearheaded, along with other folks, a blighted property, a vacant property committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| And this is just a slide of who's on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| And so I think in the past, you know, oftentimes we would say this is a codes issue, which is public service codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| This is Tom Reynolds and his team building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| This slide really is important because this is a city issue and a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| All of these folks, and I know there's people left off this list, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| It's the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| It's the council-involved neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| It's public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| It's finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| And actually right now is probably a good time to point out some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| You know, Boyce Evans is here from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| He's in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| If Boyce will raise his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| You guys know Jim, finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Bob Wetzel is with redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Chad Tindall is here from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| We've got the tax attorney, Doug Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| You know, who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| We've got Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Becky Wade from community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| We've got KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| So, we've got the fire chief in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| There's Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| So, this is an issue that crosses departmental lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| It affects departments throughout the city and outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| And that's one reason it's so challenging to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| There's not one silver bullet fix that we're going to get for blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| So, adding tools and changing our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| So, next council meeting, Mayor Rojero is going to be asking you for some initial tools to adopt some ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| and some changes that will do four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| One is streamline the Better Building Board process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| The second is to allow us to accrue interest and penalties on code liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| The third will be to establish or create an administrative hearing officer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| And the fourth is essentially create a way for us to do strategic reuse of surplus property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| property that defaults to us in a tax sale if it doesn't sell in a tax foreclosure sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| And I'm going to talk now in detail about these four kind of key bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| And it's not just four, hey, we're done, we're going to close the door on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| There's another ten that we're going to show you at the end of the presentation that we're also working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| So, this is an ongoing dynamic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Like any municipal issue, we're going to constantly be working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| and trying to find the best tools we can at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| So, let's talk about the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| The Better Building Board is the citizen board that provides the city with the legal right to do a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| It renders orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| It finds facts and renders orders on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| It basically gives us the legal authority right now to tear down properties, tear down structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| They are an approval board right now, which means we have to pretty much bring everything to that board to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| The approval model, from our perspective, decreases our ability to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| and to address issues that really do pose health issues for both occupants of rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| and to the public if we've got a piece of property that's vacant right next to another house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| And so, this approval model has worked okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| The Better Building Board, actually, when Mayor Brown was in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| the Better Building Board contacted Dr. Lyons and Mr. Martin and said, you know, this seems like a cumbersome process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| That's one reason I asked Ms. Welch to be here, and Courtney Piper, I think, is going to be here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| She's not already, to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| They actually asked, can we make this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| This seems very cumbersome, 20 or 30 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| and we're basically giving you the authority to do what you already know you need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| and you're to have the training on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| So, state law enables municipalities to structure better building boards to serve primarily in an appeal role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| where the public officer, somebody in my position, could essentially hold hearings and move more rapidly on properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| And if someone wanted to appeal that, they would appeal it to the Better Building Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| or they could appeal it to Chantry Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| And so, we see this as a tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| National Davidson County and some other municipalities have similar language they've adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| And, again, this is a transition from an approval board to an appeal board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Again, we think it will allow us to address some properties more rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| There's still a due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| There's still the constitutional notifications we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| There's still recording of the orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| All of that same due process is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| It just allows us to move slightly more rapidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| And that board, instead of hearing 30 properties that they pretty much know what we're going to do with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| they're going to truly hear appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| So, that's the first tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| The second is code liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| So, right now, if you don't pay your taxes, the finance department levies interest and penalties on nonpayment for taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=800)|
| 0:13:29| Code liens have never received those same interest and penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| even though state law enables local municipalities to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And so, again, annually we bill for $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| We might get back 10% to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Once it's a lien, there's very little motivation for someone to actually pay that lien,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| especially if they know the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| So, if you have a chronic violator that knows the system, man, let's just let it sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| I'm going to keep it the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Who cares if it sits there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Even if I get 5, 10, 15 lot mowings, it doesn't accrue any interest and penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| So, I mean, I see this as pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| I don't know if there's questions, but if somebody hasn't paid their code lien and they've not appealed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| this will allow the city to make changes in our ordinances to, again, accrue interest and penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=846)|
| 0:14:15| The third one that I'm going to talk about is the administrative hearing officer program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| State law enables municipalities to create an administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| This is where the city would hire a trained administrative hearing officer for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| a couple hundred dollars an hour, depending on the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| It's typically an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| The administrative hearing officer would be a brand-new tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| and we envision taking chronic violators before the hearing officer, the AHO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| and the AHO can levy larger penalties than municipal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| For owner-occupied residential property, that's $500 per violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| and for non-residential property, and that's anything that's not owner-occupied, it's $500 per violation per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=891)|
| 0:14:58| So instead of racking up maybe 50 times 30 days at municipal court, we could get, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| $1,500 to $2,000 pretty quickly for, again, this is for chronic violators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| and this would be a new tool that we'd like to implement, again, with a part-time AHO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| somebody we would hire per case, use it three or four times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and try to, again, motivate behavior where we've not been able to motivate behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| The fourth ordinance has to do with the disposal of real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| As you know, when we take properties to tax sale, we sometimes, if we're the only bidder, we end up with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=931)|
| 0:15:42| As Mr. York pointed out in your agenda information sheet on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| we've had nine tax sales since 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| We've accumulated something like 140 or more individual properties that we did not intend to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| Some of those, or a lot of those, actually, are typically upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| That is, the taxes exceed the real value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| But because of state law, we could not sell those properties for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| We had to collect those, which essentially made it very difficult for us to move those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| So in 2010, the state adopted a change to Tennessee Code 675-2508, adding Part D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=981)|
| 0:16:33| which allows municipalities to sell properties acquired in a tax sale for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=993)|
| 0:16:42| This means that you can, as city council, determine that it's impractical to sell a property for the taxes owed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1002)|
| 0:16:51| and we can sell it for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| The counties already had this ability, and we have been working with Chad Tindall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| and Grant Rosenberg and the county on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| They have already adopted an ordinance to sell, to declare that certain properties can be sold for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1024)|
| 0:17:16| So we're cooperating with the county so that when they are sold, we divide the proceeds on a pro rata basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1036)|
| 0:17:25| If we don't reach the amount of the taxes owed, then those taxes are waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1045)|
| 0:17:31| Now, that does two things for us, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| One is, as Mr. York points out, it allows us to sell at public auction properties that are really very difficult to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1053)|
| 0:17:45| slivers of properties, for example, that might have been left over from a TDOT project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| or properties that are really entirely undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| And we don't want the liability for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| We don't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| We never wanted to have them in the first place, so we can sell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| and we can declare them surplus and sell them at absolute auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| But it also does something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| It allows us to adopt a strategic approach to properties that we have acquired through the tax sale process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1089)|
| 0:18:19| and think about how those properties might be best utilized, repurposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| that would serve the purpose of neighborhood revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| So when we have a property in a neighborhood that is on a buildable lot, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| we may want to hold that property back and put that property into the Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1120)|
| 0:18:47| so that we can stipulate still an open process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| but we can stipulate some conditions so that we know that it's going to be developed in a manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| both in terms of design and in terms of timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| in a manner that is consistent with the revitalization plan for that neighborhood, the redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| or just good neighborhood practice in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| So it means that we have that control over that property so that when we're ready to develop it, we can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1155)|
| 0:19:28| The ordinance that is before you Tuesday is to establish the authority for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| and at a later date the administration will be bringing to you specific properties to declare upside down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1175)|
| 0:19:46| and declare that they can be sold for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| So that's that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| And then this is not a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| It's been on the book since 2003, but we have an ordinance called Demolition by Neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| It means that the owner is in effect demolishing an historic building by neglecting its upkeep, by neglecting repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1204)|
| 0:20:18| If the owner fails to make the repairs under this ordinance, the city can make the repairs and charge the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| This applies to structures in the Historic Overlay or Neighborhood Conservation Districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| and to properties that are on the National Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| It does require funds to make the repairs if the owner fails to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| In other words, if we are going to cite an owner under this ordinance, it's important that we be able to back that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| and to be able to make those repairs if the owner cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| And there's a specific property that we now want to announce tonight that Tom Reynolds, as the public officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1253)|
| 0:21:02| has issued to the owner of 953 East Moody Avenue, better known as Old South High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| a notice of violation under the Demolition by Neglect ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| This is possible because, thanks to Vice Mayor Pavlis and council last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| you all declared that property, you rezoned that property as an H1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| And because of that, we can bring this ordinance, we can bring, we can issue this notice of violation to this owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| We've attached, for your convenience, a copy of the Demolition by Neglect ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| to the letter that Mr. Reynolds sent out in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| You can look through that and see that there is a process that we have to go through to get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1309)|
| 0:22:01| where that owner is required to start making those repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| The owner has 30 days to commence real repairs and 180 days to substantially complete those repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| If that doesn't happen, then we cite the owner to the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| They can then issue a formal order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| At that point, if the owner fails to make the repairs, then the city will step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| Community Development Department has set aside and has some funds in mind to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| In this particular case, what we have here, you all remember the history of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| It was purchased at the highest bidder, sold to the highest bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| even though that bidder did not necessarily have a plan for totally redeveloping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| Part of the roof was added, and that stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| There's still leakage, serious damage in the roof, as Mr. Reynolds' letter demonstrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| And so what we would do under the ordinance is stabilize that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| That's what it allows us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| It allows us to stabilize an historic structure so that we don't lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| If the owner fails to make the repairs and we make the repairs and he fails to pay the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| then we can attach a lien to the property, and it collects 10 percent interest per annum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1403)|
| 0:23:35| So that's the bulk of the discussion about the four initiatives that you're going to see on Tuesday of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| Obviously, there's more work ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| This is, again, there's no silver bullet to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| These are complex issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| But what else are we working on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| And when I say we, there's all the folks that I pointed out in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| We actually have a statewide coalition that we're working on statewide legislation related to tax foreclosure reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| Again, understanding what we have through a blighted property data management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| And not only taxes and codes, but there's other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| that have sometimes tied that to folks that are receiving other subsidies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| You know, move in, move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| So trying to understand the problem through better data management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Managing and improving blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| We have, like, keep Knoxville beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| CAC last summer helped us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Their AmeriCorps volunteers came out and they took on about 10 blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| and just kept them clean in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| It was very economical through an AmeriCorps program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| So we also don't do a lot of communication and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| Public works isn't always the PR kind of communications folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| So how can we do a better job of, one, communicating what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Now, you'd be amazed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| I got about 10 phone calls a day from different property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| just from the front page paper story this morning wanting to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| what do I need to do or are you going to tear my building down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| So trying to get the word out that we're enforcing, but also communicating what the ordinances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| What are the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| What are the processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Community gardens are a topic that I know many of you have heard before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| So trying to work through community gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Can we be selective in our surplus program and get maybe neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| community garden space, these slivers of property that may not have real productive building use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| Could they become gardens or green spaces for communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| How we manage city-owned properties is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| These properties are defaulted to the city when they don't sell at tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| And, you know, it's a little bit of a revolving door sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| how we manage those when we have them, even though we didn't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| We want them to be, you know, productive and paying taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| But once we have them, we need to manage those a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| Dave Massey and the neighborhood folks and his advisory council are working with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| how do we work with community groups and owners to identify derelict structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| and communicate concern, neighborhood engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| And then, you know, again, we mentioned that rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| we have more problems in areas with high rental property concentrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| So what are some approaches that we can do a little better job of managing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| that rental property component within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| And so that's the bulk of our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| There's lots of folks here that can answer questions or make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| So we'll open the floor up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Well, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| And thank you all for your excellent and very informative presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| I just want to thank the administration for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| This is something that's needed to have been done for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| And I applaud the effort of bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| And it won't be easy at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I guarantee it sounds good right now, but there's going to be times where it's not going to be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| But I think we're ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| And, you know, what Dave pointed out I think is true for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| I would bet that half of my time is spent on blighted properties, overgrown properties and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| So it's not only taxing for the city, but it takes, you know, a lot of time for us to deal with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| And I know we all campaign on stronger and safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| So here's where the rubber meets the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| We've got a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| We've got some great tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| And I'm certainly going to support them coming Tuesday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| And I hope my colleagues will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I echo your comments, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| It seems like we've talked about this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| And now that it's finally here, I know that several neighborhoods I represent will be excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| But I think there's an important comment to make that this is not an issue in one segment of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| This is an issue throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| And while a street that I live on or you live on may not have blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| you don't have to drive too many blocks to find something that needs attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| So I think the use of our city resources to take care of some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| whether it's tearing down or mowing or just going out, is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| And I know that David Brace's group and Tiny and some others went out in the Westview community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| and did an inventory, and that made a huge difference in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| But we still have issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| So I'm thrilled, Mayor O'Hara, that this is coming forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| and I certainly will do everything I can to support us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Yes, thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, and thank you, Mayor O'Hara, for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| I think all of us know we must address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| You know, the broken window theory about broken windows in the neighborhood began to decrease the value and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| and encourage behavior that we really don't appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| What we're really asking here is for us all to be good neighbors to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| And then we hope that everybody benefits by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| I do have a specific question, and, Mr. Swanson, you may want to take a swing at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| This Office of the Administrative Hearing Officer, how can we --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| I thought we had a $50 fine that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| We couldn't go any higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| Now, what allows us to do a $500 per violation per day, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| How do we get around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| It's in the state statute 654-1001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| But even though that's true, the state can't violate the state constitution either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| What this is, and it is a civil administrative fine, and it is associated with the cost of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| The state has done sufficient studies to determine that a fair cost of enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| for this type of process would be about this amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| And, therefore, it meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| It's not just a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| It is a fine related to administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| And if you're going to get around that $50 limit, that's the only way to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| Let me follow that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| And this is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| The demolition by neglect, is there a specific action you were asking us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Maybe I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| We're just announcing tonight that we have issued that notice of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| and started that process on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I think the other thing that's important to mention there is the administration is committed to following through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| We're going to initiate, and if we need to follow through, we're going to follow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| We have used it in the past, but not necessarily had the funding set aside to actually take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| Councilman DelBocchi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Well, of course, I think we're all excited that we're moving forward on this approach of how do we solve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| It was terribly frustrating when you see someone come up and tell us we've been fighting this problem for eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| and we've been to the Better Building Board five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Our officers have been out 15 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| It really was cumbersome and crazy, and I think we need something more efficient to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| I'm curious, and I'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Is there any way to work with KCDC so if we get a property that's in decline but salvageable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| that they could take it over and rehab it and make it a Section 8 house or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| just somehow bring it back to life since they have the ability to do construction and remodeling work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| I didn't know if there's any way to use them as a team partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| Good question, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| And Becky Wade is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| I mean, I think I'll briefly say, you know, the city, for properties within redevelopment areas, they can utilize KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| They can also outsource acquisition to KCDC, you know, for other, you know, people that are willing to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| We have a very good mechanism in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| What about the Homemakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Well, the Homemakers is a disposition program, but the blight certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| the designation and certification of blight through the Better Building Board is a very good tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| It's a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| And so I think what's got to be there is funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| And community development, and Becky can talk about this, they do have some funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| but, you know, I think it's about $500,000 a year, and Becky can elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| It doesn't go real far, and so Becky can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| You asked specifically about KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| If you give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I'm sorry, Becky Wade, 214 Drew Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Specifically about KCDC, and I don't want to speak for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| we're currently funding a program with KCDC to acquire foreclosed properties in Mechanicsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| rehab those for resale to low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| But typically KCDC does not do rehab on existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| I mean, what they own and manage are the public housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Their Section 8 vouchers are provided to individuals who rent on the private market from private landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1975)|
| 0:33:03| So it's typically not something they're involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| And I didn't mean to keep the question narrow, but the thought was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and it partly goes to that tax foreclosure problem we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Sometimes we get these properties and we're sort of stuck with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| and we can't move them because you're worried about the original owner's equity of redemption for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| or however many months it takes for that to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| And I didn't know if there was any mechanism we had where we could turn the property over quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| and get it back to life, bring it back to being a productive part of a neighborhood rather than an anchor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2013)|
| 0:33:40| or the bad apple in the barrel that's ruining the other ones, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| That's what one of these ordinances aims to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| The one that lets the city sell tax foreclosed properties for less than the taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| A lot of our homemaker lots that are sold are sold to entities that build affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| This is the most cost-effective way for us to get new housing in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| because our only cost is the lot cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| Habitat, our CHOTOs such as KHP and some of the others, neighborhood housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| the lots they get, they build the houses and sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| We have a program that was funded initially by Empowerment Zone funds called Blighted Property Redevelopment Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| and we did provide construction loan funds to individuals who wanted to purchase a blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| rehab it, and either live in it or sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| And we're still getting program income back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| So we still have that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| It's just on a limited basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Fewer federal dollars are coming in to replenish that fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| It was funded with Empowerment Zone funds that are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| So all we have to fund that with right now is the program income we get back when somebody pays off a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2101)|
| 0:35:10| I had one other question, if I could ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| And it's probably for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| But one of the provisions talked about where it's appropriate, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| for giving the balance of the loan as part of this process of selling a property that has too much weight of lien| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| versus market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| And I didn't know if there was a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| We're giving the balance of the taxes owed both to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And then the money that comes in from that is shared pro rata between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| and the county depending on how much was owed to each entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| I was going to ask you, I was trying to set the stage for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Is there an option where you can leave that a personal liability of the individual prior owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| but free the title, the lien part of it, so that you're happy going off selling, redeveloping, fixing up the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2151)|
| 0:36:00| but you're not giving up a potential right to recover from the original deadbeat owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Now, maybe that's just pie in the sky and you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| It's an interesting question and something worthy of asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| And I am grateful for the fact that Doug Gordon is here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| We pay him good money to collect our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Because Doug, and I want to give kudos to Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| because he, along with some support from Chad Tindall of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| was very instrumental in the adoption of this statute that allows us to dispose of property in this fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| something that's been needed for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| And Doug's been a real key player in this and essentially wrote this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| And so I'm going to call upon him to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| If you'll give your name and title, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Douglas Gordon, City of Knoxville Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| If I'm understanding your question correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| is there a way to keep these old delinquent tax dollars freed from the property but still stuck with the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2218)|
| 0:37:07| Give up the equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Give up the security but go after the individual potentially if they show up and buy something else, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| We do have the authority to seek a personal judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| As authorized under 675-2501, the problem with getting a personal judgment against the former owner is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2239)|
| 0:37:29| first, you have to make sure that you did have personal service on that owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| And we do get personal service in many instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| But second of all, you're going to have to find a way to get that owner to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| You're going to have to have some traditional debt collection mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| Now, you can take that judgment for an amount owed and file it as a general lien in the Register of Deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| and that would do exactly what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| If they ever own any other property, that lien would attach to the new tract, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| That could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| We have never done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Perhaps we could look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Think of a resurrection of a deadbeat where you finally catch up with them and get your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| It's an interesting concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Now, on the other hand, there is a new concept that a lot of us folks are considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2292)|
| 0:38:19| and that is actually getting rid of the personal liability and going with an in-rem system only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| And that has been recommended by Mr. Frank Alexander of the University of Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| who is probably the leading expert on all tax collection law in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| There are certain advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| But only to the property for free recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| You would basically sue the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| You would look to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| And there are certain constitutional issues involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| We have to comply with the due process clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| And it sets forth different standards, as interpreted by the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| when it comes to personal service, personal jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| the jurisdiction over the person who owns the property versus an in-rem or property only action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Now you know why I called on Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| I want you to notice when I referred to a statute a minute ago, I read it off of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| He recited it by memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| And, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| This is something that, as you said earlier, we've all been waiting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| And I would say that we could probably take a vote tonight and shorten our council meeting on Tuesday night, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| But I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| One has to do with this goes to both Davids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| David, the last couple of nights I've heard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| And could you talk a little bit about being able to get a clear title on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| How is that working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| That's the one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| And then after you answer that, I'll ask the other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| We have to go to Doug on this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| Hasn't that been the problem in the past, that we have all this property, but you can't get a clear title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| I mean, that's going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Being able to sell the property for less than the tax is owed, if you make that determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| certainly removes one barrier to selling the property as surplus or selling it in a strategic way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| so that the property is redeveloped within a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| But there's still that title issue, which is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| We are working on tax foreclosure reform with other cities that we're hoping to introduce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| have introduced in the 2013 legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| That legislation will go a long way toward providing a clearer path to getting clear title going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2438)|
| 0:40:48| I'm not sure about existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| There are times when, if you get the right title company, you can get title insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2452)|
| 0:41:02| A lot of it depends on the research that's required to provide assurance that everyone was served adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2462)|
| 0:41:11| The city of Knoxville bends over backwards to do that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| but it's still difficult to get title companies to agree when they've got to do their own research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| to go back through all of those records to assure themselves that that title is clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| Actually, going back to Councilman Dell-Volpe's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| it relates to getting good service of process and obtaining a level of service process that results in good title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| is possibly corrected by moving to an in-rem action only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| So that's why we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Because right now, if I buy a piece of property at the tax sale, that individual also has a year to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2510)|
| 0:41:59| Are we looking at that issue also, or is that part of what this is all about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Well, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| One is I should have pointed out that in terms of the properties that you can declare as city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| they're impractical to sell for taxes owed and sell them for less than taxes owed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| That applies only to tax foreclosure properties that have been through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| that have satisfied that one-year redemption period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| So it has to have been through that before this statute takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| And then the second issue there is part of the discussion statewide about tax foreclosure reform is reducing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| if not eliminating, the redemption period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| Because, as Donna Dyer in tax property will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| we spend years locating people and giving them an opportunity to pay their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| And when they don't and we take it to tax sale, all of a sudden they get another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| Well, when we talk about, I mean, and if that's a property rights issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| we would hold up the property rights of the surrounding property owners who are paying their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| That's just another year during which nothing can happen on that property, and it continues to be a blighting influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2589)|
| 0:43:19| So that's still in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| That is still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Well, we do have the one-year redemption period in law, and that is in effect when we have a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| But all of the properties that are titled in the name of the city of Knoxville are beyond that one-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| Chancery Court issues a clerk and master's deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| and Chancery Court will not issue a clerk and master's deed until that one-year period has lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| The problem with the one-year redemption period, it comes in two different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| First of all, it seriously impedes any sort of action to get this into the hands of somebody who's going to care for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2630)|
| 0:44:00| Second of all, who wants to buy a property, be liable on it, and then not be able to do anything on it for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| Now, in the past, we've seen a redemption period of up to two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| and the code is still a little wishy-washy in various places as to this two-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| but everyone is in agreement that it's really only one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| And it really relates to more old times in the state when people would leave their property and go fight a war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2660)|
| 0:44:28| go hunting for months at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| And so we had this two-year redemption period built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| But we have a different system now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| We have better communication now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| And what we're looking at is reducing that redemption period to six months, three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| or perhaps even eliminating it entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Another recommendation of Frank Alexander is what you do is you have a tax sale, but it's not really a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| It's more of this kind of an order that says your property has been declared to be delinquent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2699)|
| 0:45:07| and you've done nothing about it, and now it simply vests to whatever local government is conducting that legal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| And then one year passes from that date, and then a tax sale is held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| and a new buyer can come in and buy that property and get a deed on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| And, therefore, we still, you know, so to speak, protect the original owner with a one-year waiting period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2728)|
| 0:45:37| but the new buyer can come in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| That still doesn't quite address the problem, though, because we still have that one-year waiting period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| So it's a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| It's been adopted, I think, in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| So that's a state issue that we'll have to reduce that time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| That is a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| We cannot do that locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| So, and again, David, the other night you were talking about how long, just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| how long it takes for the city to end up with a piece of property with the length of time you were saying, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| five to seven years at times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| But what we're trying to do is to shorten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Well, again, Doug is the best person to answer that, but there's a – well, I should just let you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| By the way, I've prosecuted the taxes of the city of Knoxville since 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| and initiated that program years ago at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| So, anyway, taxes, we must have at least two years' delinquencies on a property before we can even sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2788)|
| 0:46:38| And the tax sale litigation process is heavily controlled by Title 67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2798)|
| 0:46:48| In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court case is interpreting the 14th Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| Then, of course, we've got a lot of other civil procedure rules that come in and build in timelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| It basically builds another year or two into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| So by the time we get to the tax sale, we know that there's at least four years, in most cases, of delinquencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2825)|
| 0:47:14| And we're not even talking about the years that we're collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| We're talking about four years of taxes that are not being collected, and we're going after the older taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| On March 13th, we had a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| And at that tax sale, we sold properties that had delinquent taxes for the years 2008 and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| Anybody who bought at that tax sale, and we did have some buyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| bought subject to city and county taxes for 2009, 10, and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2860)|
| 0:47:49| And, of course, you know, whatever will be due in October for 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| So to have this one-year redemption period after most people have had three or four years to fix this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2874)|
| 0:48:06| it's just onerous and it's just ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| And it basically, it's almost insulting to all the other folks in town, the 95 to 96 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2889)|
| 0:48:18| who do pay their taxes on time, who do mow their properties and keep everything under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| That piece of property that I owed taxes on in 2008, which I most likely owed 9, 10, and 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| if I came to you the day before or the day of the sale and paid my 2008 taxes, I'd be okay, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| I have to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| You have to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| I can continue to be delinquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| There are people who do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| And I would tell all of them, this is by far the worst way to pay your taxes, because we get interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| We get penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Once it goes into the litigation, we get a litigation fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| We also have to publish these in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| And that means a publication fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| So I don't understand why people do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| We have serial delinquent taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| And all I can say is thank you for the extra money that we do not deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| So they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| Mayor, if I may, I had one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| And this goes to both of the Davids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| When we talked about demolition by neglect, we were talking about just in the H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| or the historic overlay areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| What's comparable for, let's say, in a residential in R1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| Is there a demolition by neglect for the rest of our city in terms of how do you deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2975)|
| 0:49:43| Well, for the rest of the city, we have a blighted property ordinance that allows the city to acquire blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2983)|
| 0:49:54| by going to the Better Building Board and determining and certifying those properties are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| And I don't think there is a geographical restriction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| But that is more of an acquisition process than it is a demolition by neglect process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3005)|
| 0:50:14| So to answer your question, no, that process of saying you are destroying your building by neglecting it, it's historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3014)|
| 0:50:26| We don't want to see it go downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| We don't want to lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| And, therefore, we're going to step in and require enough rehab to stabilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3030)|
| 0:50:39| There isn't a similar process outside the historic or NC1 areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| What we do have is a pretty powerful tool to acquire property if the owner fails to make repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3046)|
| 0:50:56| or to cure the default or to cure the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| And that, frankly, is probably one of our best tools for dealing with blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3059)|
| 0:51:08| restricted only by the amount of money we have to buy property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Yes, I wanted to ask, I guess I'll address this to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| A lot of these things, and we've discussed it for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| First of all, let me thank you and your staff for these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| But a lot of them are going to deal with state laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| And are we in discussion with our Knox County delegation to see if anything can be rewritten, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3095)|
| 0:51:44| that would be beneficial to the city to help us with this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Well, I think we mentioned the tax foreclosure reform that we are pursuing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| that will be a rewrite of state law to help so that the process of foreclosing on properties ends up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3116)|
| 0:52:07| as they have mentioned, we're talking about the redemption period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| and we'd like to get a process where you end up with a better title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| so the properties can be more adequately rehabbed later or redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| So we are pursuing that state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| The other state legislation we talked about, it's because we've already had those changes made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| and some existing state law is available to us that we're able to bring these ordinances to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| And let me ask about the absolute auctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| I know the new Sentinel did a series, I guess a couple of years ago now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| and it's several people that own a lot of these properties, some of the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| And when we have these auctions, are there any restrictions on who can bid on these auctions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3168)|
| 0:52:55| because you have the same people acquiring more properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Doug may jump up there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| I don't believe there are, but there are discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| We have a you talk about the statewide legislative changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| There is a group of folks from Knoxville, Memphis, Chattanooga, and Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| that have been working the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| It actually started when Mayor Rojero was in community development, the director of community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| And so those kind of strategies, what is the best way to move some of this legislation through at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| that group is trying to determine that best strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| That's one reason we held off on the tax foreclosure reform until 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| We didn't feel like we were ready with a broad strategy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| But Doug can talk about the details of who can bid and who can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| For this new amendment, this is an amendment to 2-722.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| It's a subpart 9, and it only applies to properties acquired in a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| Now, the ordinance states that the properties can be sold at absolute auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| or through another program authorized by the city of Knoxville's city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| Now, two points on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| First of all, when it comes to an absolute auction, absolutely, there is no check on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| Other programs that the city of Knoxville has, basically I'm referring to the homemaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| Now, the homemaker program is also an auction-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| but it's a program where factors come into play other than just who has the highest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| And indeed, in many cases, the person who has the highest bid is not the person who takes the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| There is a panel of people who review these transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| and ultimately every one of these transactions goes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I'm not the expert on the homemaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I think David Massey probably could speak about it at great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| But the ordinance gives us the option of picking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| Many of these properties could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| They're in a redevelopment zone, and the best use for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| and probably the best revenue generator for the city would be to go through the homemaker program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| And right now, we've considered a list of 140 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| These are all the properties that we have acquired that were not already pulled out because they're in a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| We had our flood zone engineers look at these things first, and they pulled a bunch of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| But basically, the Department of Community Development has identified a number of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| that they would prefer be sold through the homemaker program rather than the absolute auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| So what we hope to do is pick those properties in a redevelopment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| develop them in a sensible, intelligent way rather than just throwing them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| The properties that you'll see that will go up for absolute auction, these are going to be your drainage ditches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| your hillsides, well, not drainage ditches that flood, of course, because the engineering has already pulled those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| but a lot of just undeveloped properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| As mentioned earlier, we have acquired a few properties that were left over from TDOT condemnations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| and they're these weird little triangles that nobody can use except maybe the neighboring property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| If you try to sell one of these properties to the neighboring property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| first of all, under current conditions, you're going to have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| I'd like to sell you this awful little triangle for $5,000 because that's what's still on the books as being owed on taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3388)|
| 0:56:40| And the property owner is going to say to you, well, I already plant my vegetables on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| I don't pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| I already park my truck on it, and I don't have to pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| Why in the world would I want to buy it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Well, the absolute auction allows us to put the property out there and find a true market value for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| And that true market value may be $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| And that's going to set what that's going to redefine how the property assessor looks at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| It's going to make that property something that the neighboring property owner will want to buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| and own and mow and pay taxes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| Can I just have Doug clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Doug, so in any of the proposed legislation statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| is there any discussion about being able to restrict who can bid at absolute auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| I think that was part of that original question was can we limit if somebody has a lot of, say somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| like right now I think if you have a lot of back taxes on other property, you can still come in and bid on property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| That has been part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I don't think that has gone too far yet down the path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| We've been so focused on tax foreclosure reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| But that discussion with the statewide group is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| Can it happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| I mean, I think Doug would, you know, obviously have more of expertise on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| But that discussion is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| How do we keep poor owners from buying more poor property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| And so absent that ability right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| that's why we want to be able to move more property into the Homemakers Program rather than just going to absolute auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| because we do have discretion in the Homemakers Program for who ends up with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| They have to be able to show the ability to redevelop it and do it within a certain amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| or the property comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Restricting who can buy at one of these absolute auctions or even at the tax sale itself has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| And just I have to say I remember one day when one of the people in the tax office, Mr. Ray Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3514)|
| 0:58:42| was expressing disgust in the fact that one of our delinquent taxpayers bought another property at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| It does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| And it would be great to have a statute that says we can say that people who have delinquent taxes on properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3530)|
| 0:58:58| or have blighted properties cannot acquire more and build on our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| I think Mr. Evans has a comment to make on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| Just real briefly, Boyce Evans, 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee, 37716.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| Purchasing agent for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Bottom line right now is unless you have barred somebody from bidding, then they can bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3557)|
| 0:59:26| But the city does have the authority to debar somebody from bidding for various things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3566)|
| 0:59:37| It's normally, though, based on unethical practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| And, you know, we'd have to work with the law department to see how that fit to a particular case, if it did fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| So we can bar people to bidding or from bidding, but that's really the only action we've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3591)|
| 1:00:00| And, again, that's normally for unethical type behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Mr. Massey, I think you've already answered my question, but I just want to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| Properties that are not necessarily delinquent in taxes can still be blighted, and I know some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3616)|
| 1:00:24| So the answer you gave to Mr. Greave, would that be the answer to me about what we can do about those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| that are current on their taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Yeah, I mean, there is definitely a correlation and a pretty strong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| Generally, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Between people who are not paying properties where the taxes are delinquent and that are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Those get close to being abandoned properties for all practical purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| But, absolutely, there are owners of blighted property who are up to date on their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| but are still subject to the codes of the city of Knoxville and would be subject to, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| the new AHO administrative hearing process or our municipal court process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| So that, I have to assume, is a complaint-driven process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| So if a neighborhood notices that somebody is not maintaining or that somebody is still living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| but the place is a wreck, can they file a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| And then that's followed up how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| That falls into neighborhood codes inspection, our nine inspectors in the field, our codes manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| Right now, last month, we were 70 percent proactive complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| We've been anywhere from 50 to 60 on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| And we started getting proactive about the time we came here and made some ordinance changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| that would allow us to go to city court and we could actually address junking in yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| We added some language, if you folks remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| So right now we're already 60 percent proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| I would love that to be at 80 or 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Our codes manager knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| And so trying to get more production out of that team to make sure we're more proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| I don't want a citizen to call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| And if they call in, I want it to be in permits plus already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| And right now that's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| So there's a drive to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Obviously, if anybody has a concern about a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| they can contact the city by calling 311 or contacting staff or their council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| And we'll definitely get out and inspect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Again, we inspect 11,000 to 12,000 lots a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| We mow 2,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| We clean up 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| We consistently tear down about 60 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| So there's lots of action in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| I think it's these chronic problems that can't get clear title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| and basically have to go through this very lengthy tax sale, tax foreclosure reform process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| that creates that two to ten year window where there's a bad property in somebody's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| And that's a big deal because of loss of property value for those residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I'm not sure how to phrase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| And I know that this is probably a state issue, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| that maybe we should be looking at and maybe you folks plan to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| But where do we stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Or is there any thought given to renter registration in terms of people that rent properties registering with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| I know that this has been in discussion before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| and I think there's only two cities that are allowed to do that statewide, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| But is this being looked into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Yes, we are looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| There is a state law that applies only to Nashville and Oak Ridge that allows those two municipalities to basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| it's a rental registration ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| The reasoning behind that law and that ordinance enacted, by the way, only in Nashville so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3826)|
| 1:03:57| is that when codes enforcement wants to cite somebody for a notice of violation, a lot of times you can't find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3837)|
| 1:04:07| If it's an absentee owner, out-of-state owner, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| So the idea behind that, first and foremost, was to have someone to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3850)|
| 1:04:19| And then there is a piece to it that involves some periodic inspection of rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3859)|
| 1:04:27| There's a real difficulty with that state law, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| and that is that the state law caps the amount you can charge for the registration to $10 per landlord per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3870)|
| 1:04:42| no matter how many rental units they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And so just having ourselves added to that ordinance doesn't help us a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| because to have a true inspections program would require additional staff, and we wouldn't be able to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| The other issue is that it's going to take, I think, some education throughout the community to have something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3900)|
| 1:05:10| a really strong rental inspection ordinance passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Obviously, we would want to work with the responsible landlords and doing that in a way that is not a burden on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| But we know from personal experience when KPD goes in and does a raid on a property and sees the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3922)|
| 1:05:32| and codes comes in, we know that we have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| Codes cannot just walk into a rental property unless a renter invites them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| That's the constraint we're under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| And so getting to that point where we can hope to get a stronger state law passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3945)|
| 1:05:53| to allow us to adopt an ordinance to get to that is no easy cakewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| And, frankly, our strategy was to deal with tax foreclosure reform first, concentrate on that, build a coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3960)|
| 1:06:10| work on networking with all of the people across the state, not just in the four major cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| but throughout the state who care about blighted property, municipalities, counties, cities and towns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| both governmental and nongovernmental organizations so that we could build that coalition to later take on larger tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3987)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Well, this is a great beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Madam Mayor, anything else that you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| No, I think I've got great staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Wouldn't you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Done a great job on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| I also want to recognize all the neighborhood leaders who have helped us over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| They've been a very big part of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| both our Neighborhood Advisory Council and other neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| So we really appreciate it because we couldn't have gotten this far without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| And we look forward to Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| I think things are going to go your way Tuesday night, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| So there's no other lights, and I was going to see if anyone wanted to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| speak to anything that we've discussed here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| You're more than welcome to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| You'll give your name and address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| My name is Brandon Beavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| I live at 2403 Davenport Road, and I guess I'm a good example of what can happen when there are blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| Friday night I was assaulted in my own backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| I live across from Spanish Trace Apartments, an apartment complex that's been a real problem in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| I was just standing out in my backyard when a guy came along, released his pit bull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| and started hunting the neighbor's cat in my backyard, and I asked him to leave my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| He responded by coming over and sucker punching me and then beating me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| Spanish Trace has been a real problem in our neighborhood for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| I see empty buildings with people coming in and out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| There's a gang of between eight to 12 people that occupy the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| and there's not a lot we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| So I hope you keep in mind that things like this, blighted buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| apartment complexes that have no apparent management and where criminal gangs apparently manage the apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| they do have real consequences for real people who are taxpaying citizens, who are peaceful people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4110)|
| 1:08:38| who, you know, just want to live peacefully with their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Well, you're welcome, and I appreciate you coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I hate the unfortunate situation, but there is something that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| And we've already taken the initiative to set a meeting with various departments within the city to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4129)|
| 1:08:57| to find solutions to problems, to problem properties as such, and the people that inhabit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| So, I mean, there are laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| You can't just beat somebody up in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| No front yard either, or side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Anyone else wish to address the council this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| I think it's a real tribute to the enforcement, what's being brought forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| because typically at a workshop we don't see the amount of folks that we have here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| and you can tell by the audience that people are excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| Councilman Del Voco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Yeah, I was going to ask one question, and I don't know if it's for Mr. Swanson or for Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| but where we have properties we want to get back into circulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| we're worried about equity of redemption and timeframes, drag it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| Can't we file a condemnation suit, take the property, pay into court our tax lien and $1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| and let them contest the amount if they want to, but you get titled as soon as you file the paper within five days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| under the quick-taking act, is there some possibility of simply getting the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| and moving on with your business, and if the guy wants to fight about what it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| let him worry about that and get an appraiser and try to get more money out of you somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Is it too costly to do, or do we do that sometimes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| We do it on occasion, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| You would cut off his equity of redemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| It's just down to fair market value, and is the lien bigger than his residual rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| There's no equity of redemption on one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| I guess we stand adjourned then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120315?start=4242)|
