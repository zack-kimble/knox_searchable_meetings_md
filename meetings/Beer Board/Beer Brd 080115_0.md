| 0:00:59| I have had a conversation, oh, I guess six weeks ago, with someone about the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=59)|
| 0:01:07| of this particular property and this particular, I guess you'd say restaurant, going in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=67)|
| 0:01:16| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I have heard nothing else from them, but I would like to make a motion, can I do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| that we postpone this until the February meeting and that, in the meantime, I'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=83)|
| 0:01:33| if that is alive at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=93)|

| 0:01:57| Chairman, we've got, oh, so much, I guess we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| Come right over, right over there, sir, right over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=121)|

| 0:02:10| I'll let him speak and then I will comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| Could you give us a name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| Blues and Jazz Bar on East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| I can't think about the address right at the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| I need your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| My name is Shepperton Willis, 315 North Castle Street, Apartment 12, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| No record, all evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| We just need a final business tax return from the current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| Mark, I'm trying to figure, what is your relationship to the, you're not the applicant, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| You're Kerry Jackson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| No, I'm Shepperton Willis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| He's listed as a manager on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| However, and it's up to the Beer Board, and it's the Beer Board's pleasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| we do have a document with us about some issues related to this particular beer permit, this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| I have been contacted by the prior beer permit owner, Ms. Sharon Underwood, Upshaw, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=200)|
| 0:03:30| and she states to me everything is consistent with this Jazz and Blues Club estimated timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| There's a letter from her to Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| I haven't read the letter, but I did speak to Ms. Upshaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| I have some concerns about the efficacy of what we're doing here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| and actually the status of the past beer permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| and I would ask that at least the Beer Board postpone this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| so we can do a little further investigation or have Ms. Upshaw maybe come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| and we can get to the bottom of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| She states that there have been some criminal proceedings filed with regards to some of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| and I think we would be remiss if we granted a license at this juncture while we have this quagmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Ms. Martin, did you have something you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| I was just going to say that Ms. Upshaw has a current beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| and we understand she doesn't intend to, she doesn't want to stop the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| and I believe she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| She is here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Yes, she is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Mr. Vice Mayor, how long of a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Well, we may not even need a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| The current permit owner is here, has a valid beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| I know she was back there, and if hers is still valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| she's not forfeiting hers so we can get her opinion from our attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| but I don't think we can grant another beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| You can only have one beer permit per location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| and if you have a current outstanding beer permit that has not been surrendered or turned in or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| and this person intends to use that beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| then I don't think you can grant another beer permit for that same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| Let me ask you something, Ms. Upshaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| As was just stated, you have a current beer permit, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Do you plan on continuing to operate in that establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I do plan on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| I have contacted the district attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| They have a warrant for the arrest of Mustafa Muhammad Ali,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| which is a friend to Mr. Willis, and he's running right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| Without getting into the particulars of the potential criminal proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| you currently are operating your business there, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| No, I do not have access into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| I can tell you how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| I've asked the police department for assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| I've went to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I've sent him a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I have no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| I've retained an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| My license was stolen off the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| That's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| And Mr. Ali changed the locks without permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and then him and this gentleman began to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| and they both came uptown here and applied for a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| According to our records and what I heard, you still have a current beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I'd make a motion to either allow the gentleman to withdraw it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| or a motion to deny the application for the beer permit that's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| I don't think we can legally grant a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| so either he needs to be allowed to withdraw it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| or I would make a motion that one that is before us today be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| because we can't grant another beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| I think you need to withdraw your first motion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Which was to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| I withdraw that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| I withdraw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Councilperson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Chairman, I was wondering if Shepperton, do you have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| Yes, but I don't know anything about no theft of a license or nothing of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| I don't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| This is news to me about the theft of a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| In fact, I've never heard of such a charge in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| I informed Mr. Willis on the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| He was there when the police called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| You know, I think we don't get to having the back and forth, he say, she say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| I think it's important enough that Ms. Martin and Ms. Day have told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| that there is a valid beer permit that Ms. Upshaw has and that is for this premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| and as such, going to our attorney, we cannot grant another beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| So as you all work through whatever criminal proceedings are going out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| I think we are not in a position to grant a beer permit and are not authorized to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Well, I don't know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| I don't know anything about any theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| I know the beer license was turned in, and the next day she went back and got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| I don't know anything about no theft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| All I know is that she's supposed to have been informed that the license would be removed from the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=474)|
| 0:08:01| Before you say anything else, let's not get into the particulars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| because just that one statement alone says you knew that the license was moved from the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| So let's stop that there, and I think what I hear from our lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| and what I hear from our experts here is that there's a valid beer permit for this premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| currently in effect and existing, and Ms. Upshaw owns that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| and that as such, we cannot issue another beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| I mean, and that's where we have to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| We don't need to get into adjudicating whether or not you're right, she's right, who's wrong, who did what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| We just are in the constraints of can we grant a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| and right now we cannot grant a beer permit under these facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| And if I'm in errors, please correct me, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| But, you know, I might as well just go out of business if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| because not being able to get a beer permit will put me out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| Are you all going to have to litigate that between the parties who are at issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| over the right to occupy the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| But we cannot adjudicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Are you selling beer right now, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| No, the place is closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| So we have a motion to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| No, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Do you understand what we just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| We don't have any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| I'd like to give the gentleman an opportunity to withdraw the petition as opposed to having it denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| If you're not willing to withdraw your application based on what you've just heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| then I'll be forced to make a motion that it be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| So you need to let me know what you'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| To withdraw it or do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| If you don't withdraw it, then we're going to vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| and on what you heard and what my motion is going to be to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| because we cannot grant you a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| Now, you can withdraw it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Do you want to have that adverse action out there that it's been denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| I don't wish to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| Make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| And so the record reflects based on the reasons stated before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Well, he could get a license, just not at this premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| And just not at this premises right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| And I hate you put up your money, and I don't know all the background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| but it's an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| So we have a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=634)|

| 0:12:35| If I may, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| As the beer board would remember, this issue came up at last beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| I asked that it be postponed so that we could look at the law pertaining to the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| I have since discovered and have told Mr. Cobb that this particular stretch of Martin Luther King has been exempted from that exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=759)|
| 0:13:08| It was removed from that exception in 98 or 99, so it no longer exists for that particular part of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| So, he would not fall within that exception, and therefore, he would be too close to a couple of churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| So, I've informed him of that, and he's not going to be here tonight and asked me to go ahead and ask that it be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=811)|

| 0:14:13| Yes, it was in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=853)|

| 0:14:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=860)|

| 0:14:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Ms. Martin, do you want to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I will be glad to point it out to you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| You have been provided tonight, it should say draft and it does not, but it is indeed a draft of the documents for our beer permit application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=876)|
| 0:14:49| This is a result of conversations that the revenue staff had amongst ourselves and conversations we had with the police department and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=889)|
| 0:15:01| I recommend you take this, look it over, and come back to me with questions, suggestions, requests, whatever you may have that you need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=901)|
| 0:15:11| Feel free to call us and we'll be glad to try to explain what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| In terms of any code changes that may be proposed, I don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| The law department will be providing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| I will call to your attention on the first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| You'll find a little below, halfway down, daycare in italics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| And then if you go to the page at the back of the documents, daycare is also in italics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=935)|
| 0:15:46| The only reason for that is that it's not actually, if I have this right, it's not actually in our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| So the question would be for you all, do you want to specify daycare or have it taken off the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| So that's something for you to think about and it would be a code change that would have to be prepared and submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=963)|
| 0:16:15| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Is there a formal definition for daycare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| I think the statutes have a definition, but I don't want to play attorney here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| We have a definition for school that includes some portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| School means any primary school, secondary school, nursery school, or kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| and shall not be interpreted to include any industrial, technical, or trade school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| any building or facility of the University of Tennessee, or any other institution of higher learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| That's the definition for school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| And so daycare is nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| It doesn't say daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| It says nursery school or kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| And those are, in my opinion, different connotations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| So I guess my question is how do we determine what constitutes a daycare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| Well, we could change the word daycare to something else that is defined if it meets your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| It certainly is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| What would be more advisable, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| to change the word daycare to something that's already identified in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| or for us to have daycare added to our definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| You can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I, frankly, would probably eliminate daycare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| and just utilize words that are actually in our code if it were me, but you could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| Could you provide us a copy of that definition that you just provided, read to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| If you would, I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I beg to differ with our fine counsel in that being a mother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| and having had children in nursery school, I think of a daycare as being separate from a nursery school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| And I personally would not want an establishment selling beer close to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| where my children are being cared for during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| So I would respectfully take the other opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| and want to add daycare, perhaps, to that indication in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| You know, kindergarten, nursery school, daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Now, if that means we have to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| I don't have a quarrel with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I wasn't dealing with substantive issues of what all you want to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| I was dealing with the issue of having language in the code that's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| And if you want it to include every manner of daycare, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| You just make the other change and define daycare as to what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Well, other members of the beer board may disagree, but that would be my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| I would tend to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Counsel Mbeile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Mr. Chairman, I was going to just bring up what Charles just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| You know, I think you have to come up with a definition of childcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| because they have popped up all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| And I'm not sure exactly how they're permitted in, you know, state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| or locally or what have you, but I could see a real argument there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| and I think that's going to be key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Counsel Mbeile, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| I'm sorry, there's no line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Counsel Mbeile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| I agree with Councilwoman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| and so then my question is who creates the new language for daycare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| Because that is actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Well, actually, if you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I think we'll have to change an ordinance or something to include whatever we put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| If you're going to go in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| then you're going to want to provide a specific definition of daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Well, I don't know who comes up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| I completely agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Counsel Mbeile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I also agree with Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| I was going to say there should be something in our zoning code on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| I would assume there's a definition in there, and that might be worth checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1207)|
| 0:20:17| Well, you know, really, all this business about daycare centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| it's kind of new in the last 20, 25 years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| in terms of permitting and liability and responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| and actually technically having legitimate daycare centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| So I just want to, you know, put two and two together here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| and we're just going to have to define daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| I was just going to say that I know that Allison Eberting had looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| and she may have had her fingers in the state law looking for definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| and I'm sure between Ms. Eberting and the advice of Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1254)|
| 0:21:03| we could come up with some language that's suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| I'll get a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| If you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080115?start=1278)|
