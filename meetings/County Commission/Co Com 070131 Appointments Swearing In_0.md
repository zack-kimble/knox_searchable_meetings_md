| 0:16:19| Four for Mr. Stooksbury, zero for Mr. Lawhorn, and one abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| So, Commissioner Tindall, you've now been appointed to the Knox County Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=986)|
| 0:16:46| I know there's no speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| I would like to thank my colleagues for the faith they have in me and my constituents, my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| if I could go on, but I'll stop now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Thanks again, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| I would ask that my good colleague be sworn in just as we just sworn in the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Well, I think we've got that set up for 2 o'clock because of some paperwork that they have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| in the clerk's office and some of these other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Does that satisfy you, Mr. Tindall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| Yeah, I was waiting on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I thought it was 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| But is it 2 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| We're going to try to do it at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Where at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| In here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| In here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| May I have clarification of the law director at this point regarding Mr. Tindall's status as a voting member of this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| According to the charter of Knox County, congratulations, Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Is that in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Your seat is now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| I don't, as a non-lawyer, of course, I don't agree with that, but I'm going to respect our director's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1064)|
| 0:17:51| I will remove myself from at least this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| I'll hang around, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| The Knox County Charter states this, if the commission member is elected, which you just were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| his or her seat on the commission shall immediately be vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| You've been elected to another office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Mr. Buda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| To continue on with that thought, now we only have 18 members of this body that can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| If we were to immediately go to fill Commissioner Tindall's seat, could that person deliberate with us right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1103)|
| 0:18:33| If the person is sworn in, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| If you're going to rely on the swearing in as being the official act, he's not been sworn in to his new office yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| Why can't he continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Because the charter says that his seat is immediately vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| So we've got another hole in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| The charter is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| And we can say that it's crystal clear on that point that Commissioner Tindall's seat is now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| Why not swear him in and then go to the second district and try to appoint somebody and swear them in at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| If you wish to swear Commissioner Tindall in now to take over the duties of the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| Commissioner Tindall will be presiding as clerk for the remainder of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| I'd say Mr. Padgett would be glad to yield that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| You know, does Mr. Tindall have a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| You have a choice, Billy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I think just for clarifications and just to keep making sure we don't continue down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| potentially lawsuits will be over this one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| You know, I think the votes are not going to be that close probably one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| And we've got the register of deeds and the trustee and then the third race will be in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1191)|
| 0:19:59| So, Mr. Chairman, do you know something I don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Well, if it comes down to it, if they're close, it's going to be nine and nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Somebody is going to have to change something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| But I think according to the law, we don't need to have potential lawsuits over this one appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| Well, I think we can proceed with 18 persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| That's what I think we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| Mr. Clerk, since we're on this subject, and I don't know, I was going to bring this up when we got to the commission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1223)|
| 0:20:33| The process, I haven't heard of a process in which we're going to go about filling these commission seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| But as I understand it in discussions with my lawyer, that once a commission seat has been filled by this appointment process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1238)|
| 0:20:48| the commissioner who is being replaced can no longer vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Is that how we're doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| No, that's not the way that I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| So, let's just, for example, say the seat A of the fourth district is the first commission seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| and John Doe is appointed to replace me, I can continue to vote on these other seats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| The Tennessee Supreme Court, I believe, made it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| In Jordan versus Knox County, they said that the persons who are term limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| who have been ineligible to be in office and are, in effect, holdovers since September 1, may continue in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1288)|
| 0:21:36| continue to operate their acts are valid until their successors are named in accordance with law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| That also means qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Qualified in this instance means sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| And so, you know, to further clarify that for you, Commissioner, if a person is elected to a commission post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1310)|
| 0:22:00| and they wish to step out into the hall and be sworn, they can come in and take their seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| Mr. Law Director, I direct your attention to Section 2.08 of our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| where it says in the event of a vacancy in the office of a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| the remaining members of the commission, let me stress the word remaining members of the commission, shall fill said vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| There's no reference there to holdovers or it says the remaining members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| So if a person, if either a vacancy exists and we are filling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| and the person whose seat is being vacated cannot vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| or we have this sort of odd Zen-like world where they're here for the purpose of a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| but they're not here for the purpose of vacancy, but they're here for the purpose of voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| We can't have that legally both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| I would agree with Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| I think we are opening ourselves to many challenges, not just one, should, using the example of my seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| I continue to vote for other spots in this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| I don't see anywhere in reference to the state law or charter law that allows, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| using me as an example, to continue voting on other seats after my position has been vacated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| And I would strongly suggest that we are just allowing those who may not make the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| who have expressed interest in this race, to challenge other votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Simply saying that Commissioner Schmidt was already replaced when the appointment for the ninth district came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| and his vote was an illegal vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| I just want to go on record as, with all due respect to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| who has done magnificent work over these last few weeks, that this is simply a disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| And I would challenge that opinion and further suggest to our fellow commissioners we are opening ourselves to more legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1427)|
| 0:23:55| situations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I understand your argument, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| And you still have to refer back to the Supreme Court's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| The Supreme Court didn't say commissioners can stay on until all appointments, it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| until their successors are named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| And when an appointment is named to my seat, that's what the Supreme Court asks to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| In accordance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| And the law is very --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| The law is our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| The law doesn't say we can delay and continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| What can you cite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Okay, Commissioner Schmidt, we understand, but we've got to depend on the law director of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| His is an opinion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| But he's going to be the one representing this county in case there are challenges to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Commissioner Gries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I challenge the ruling of the chair and ask for a roll call vote on this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| Second, if you need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Okay, start in the first position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Mr. Chairman, I need you to recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| I'm going to offer a substitute motion that this commission agree to agree with the position of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1485)|
| 0:24:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=1495)|

| 0:33:34| asked me this morning to withdraw due to the fact that he did not want to put me in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| of where I might have violated the Sunshine Act, according to the article in this morning's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=2020)|

| 0:33:48| So I just want to say on behalf of Mr. Fisher, many of you who I called, and for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| just simply called to let you know who he was, why I supported him, and not actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| get a confirmation of your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=2040)|

| 0:34:49| Mr. Schmidt, is there any reason why I shouldn't do that, or has he asked to be totally withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=2089)|

| 1:01:47| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move that this item be moved to the end of the agenda, and let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| proceed with the next nomination. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3711)|

| 1:02:03| Opposed, no. No. Okay, we'll do a roll call vote, starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| in the First District. What are we voting for, Scott? Voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| on putting the Commissioner of the Fourth District as seat B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| off until the end of our agenda. That would be following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| Would you reopen the bid or just reopen the nomination or just between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| Lee Trammell and Scott Davis? Just leave it where it is, and after Commissioner Jordan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| replacement is named, we'd come back to seat 4A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| 4B, I'm sorry. That's not at the end. Who's the last one? Well, it would be in the Ninth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| No, it wouldn't be. If we start in the Fourth, what does it do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| Circle around to the Second? No, we go back to the First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| We have to go back to the First to stay within our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| We moved item 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Commission seat 4A and B at the request of the Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| Mr. Chairman, I have a question about our procedures. Don't our commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| call for us voting and dropping Lois' name until we have a winner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| I don't see anywhere in there where it allows an interruption. I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Mr. Law Director, do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| respond? What you're doing, you're amending the agenda basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| right now, so it's going to take a two-thirds vote. I'd argue, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Law Director, I'm not amending the agenda in any sense other than just suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| if we're at an impasse, we move it to the back and let's handle these others and come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| Mr. Law Director, is it a majority vote or two-thirds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| I believe it's a two-thirds vote. I believe what you're doing is amending the agenda and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| placing this item in another place. The agenda was set by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| notice of the Chair and by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| publication in the new Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| and so any variation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| from that would be an amendment and requires a two-thirds vote of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Okay, so are you ready to vote? I guess we'll do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Mr. Clerk, starting in the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| What are we voting for? I guess a yes vote would be to put this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| off until the end of our agenda. Is that on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| seat B? A's been handled, hasn't it? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3855)|

| 1:05:11| Somebody send out and get lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| It's not a two-thirds vote. It's not even a majority. It's nine ayes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=3915)|

| 1:43:54| Davis and Lee Tramble. Start in the 9th District, if you don't care, Mr. Clark. Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6234)|
| 1:44:08| Mr. Chairman, a procedural point. Yes, sir. I noticed that someone new seated at the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| table. I was supposed to introduce the new Commissioner from the 2nd District, Mr. Chuck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| Bolus. He's been duly sworn. Mr. Chairman, you stated earlier in the meeting that you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| be swearing all the Commissioners at the very end of the proceeding, and this sort of sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| and selective swearing in of one, I think, really stinks up a process that is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| beginning to smell up the room. Hey, we can ask the Law Director if the process is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6272)|
| 1:44:38| Mr. Law Director. This has always been a possibility that this would occur, and we have discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6278)|
| 1:44:46| I believe, on several occasions. This Commissioner is filling a term-limited Commissioner's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| He has taken the oath of office. Whether it's on our agenda or not, he has taken an oath of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| office, as I understand it. His oath has been filed with the Clerk's Office, and in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| he may take his seat. You know, Mr. Commissioner Speed, you got sworn in early, too, in the last election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| So, I mean, it's your duty. Can I speak? Do you read my mind? No, I was just making sure. I was going to agree with the Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| Director that this is a legal move. Let him speak. Thank you. Are you sure, John? This is a legal move, but the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6321)|
| 1:45:33| this move is simply to put in a candidate from a certain faction on this Commission, and I think the process here speaks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6333)|
| 1:45:43| itself. It stings to high heaven. No disrespect to Mr. Bolus, who I do not know, but this is obviously a move that is, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6343)|
| 1:45:51| very least, duplicious and underhanded, and it is disrespectful to Commissioner Gutta. It is disrespectful to myself, and it is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| insult to the people of the 4th District, should this vote turn out the way I think it is. Thank you. Okay, Commissioner Gutta, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| don't know if we're really supposed to... Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have been disrespected before, and I'm sure this won't be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| last time I'll get past it, but I want you to notice that we've saved the last until now. I didn't say we saved the best till| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6374)|
| 1:46:25| last. I said we saved the last till now, but I do want to ask the Law Director a question. In addition to the Commission, since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6385)|
| 1:46:37| makeup of Commission has changed, there may be some that would question whether or not we have to start over from the beginning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6397)|
| 1:46:45| take nominations from the floor. I would like to have you respond to that, to those that might think that way. Starting all over, in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6405)|
| 1:46:52| words. For this vote, I think you make a good point. I think you make a real good point. This Commissioner has not been involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6412)|
| 1:47:02| vote, has just been sworn, and so with that said, I would agree with Commissioner Gutta that we ought to start over in the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6422)|
| 1:47:14| District with the nomination process. I don't think you need a motion for that effect, Mr. Chairman. You've heard a ruling from the Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6434)|
| 1:47:22| Department that we should start from the beginning again. I think this body respects the opinion of the Law Director, and we respect the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6442)|
| 1:47:30| Commissioner Lambert? I just have a question for the Law Director. For any of the other folks who have already been appointed, they have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6450)|
| 1:47:39| option of going ahead and being sworn in too, don't they? They have always had that option, yes sir. Well, in the interest of fairness, I so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6459)|
| 1:47:47| move that we take a recess for 10 minutes, and any of the newly appointees who choose to go ahead and take their oath, we allow them to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| their oath and take their seat. That would only be fair, don't you think? I think if anyone wants to take their seat, have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6475)|
| 1:48:08| I'll make a motion then that we recess until these officers be sworn in, and then we reconvene. Do we have a second question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6488)|
| 1:48:19| They have to request to be sworn in. Question. They were not asked to say, what if you can't reach some of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| Those that are here, let them get sworn in. If they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| I think Mr. Cate was asked early on, and he didn't want to get sworn in. I don't know if anybody else wants to get sworn in. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6512)|
| 1:48:39| Jordan, I don't think she said Commissioner Josh Jordan wants to be sworn in. If we want to start over, we need to finish the process, because we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| got a two o'clock swearing in. We've got to get this government back to going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| That's it. I think that's your opinion, Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| I'm not sure that you've answered my question. Do we at least need to make a phone call to the ones that maybe are not present that would want to be sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6535)|
| 1:49:05| Mr. Law Director, do you want to answer that? That's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| We've got a swearing in set for two o'clock, and I think most people understand that. But they've always had the option, and we realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| someone could take an oath of office, and I think Mr. Boas did so because the 2nd District wasn't being represented all the way. That was the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| member missing on this body. We had a 19-member body. It went down to 18. So I don't know if we want to just recess to do the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6563)|
| 1:49:31| because the 2nd District wasn't represented. Mr. Chairman, if I made a motion to have a recess to allow people to be sworn in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6571)|
| 1:49:39| I'll withdraw that motion. I'm ready to go on and vote. Let's go. But I would also say if there are those here that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6579)|
| 1:49:47| appointed that would like to be sworn in, that they stand up now and be recognized and get sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6587)|
| 1:49:53| Does anybody here that's been appointed to the County Commission wish to take their seat right now at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| Mr. Chairman, may I take a point of personal privilege to your statement that the 2nd District was not being represented? I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6599)|
| 1:50:06| No, sir. I'm saying it's not represented with two members. You've got one member. Everybody else has got two members voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6606)|
| 1:50:13| That's fine. Your clarification is just all that I needed, because I'm representing the 2nd District and a lot of people out there who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6613)|
| 1:50:20| dislike this process very much. You're representing the 2nd District, but you're representing it without your counterpart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6620)|
| 1:50:26| Mr. Chairman, did not the law director say when we first started this process that anybody that chose to go out in the hallway out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6626)|
| 1:50:35| and get sworn in would have the right to come in and take this seat immediately? That is correct. Apparently, Mr. Bolus is the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| that wanted to do that. The others aren't here, apparently, or they didn't follow through with that. I see nothing wrong with Mr. Bolus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| sitting in this seat, because he took the direction from the law director, and everybody had that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| I say we start just over...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| We've got rules. We have to follow them. We may not like them, but it's like the law. These things we have to do, and we have to bite the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| bullet sometimes. You can say it stinks or does what, but everybody else had the same opportunity as Mr. Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| I think we need to get back to the nomination process. We'll start over in the 4th District and take nominations all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6667)|

| 1:53:08| ever did before. I served on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6788)|

| 1:53:16| body, out of respect to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| out of respect to the office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6798)|

| 1:53:40| my name and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| for the county having to endure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| such a travesty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| in my mind. I hope and pray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| that we as a body can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| together. We've had bickering in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| for the last 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| which is desperately unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| We have an opportunity right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| to change that and to move forward in a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| way. And I hope and pray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| takes this upon yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| to help us move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| Knoxville forward in a positive direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| and stop the fighting and bickering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| and the backroom deals that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| for years and years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| And I pray that each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| takes that to heart and moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| forward. Okay? We have a beautiful place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| It's a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| I hate to see our government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| put into turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| And out of respect for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| out of respect for this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| I respectfully withdraw my name. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=6876)|

| 2:01:44| in many ways I think it is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| difficult to win an appointment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7306)|

| 2:02:16| a legislative body to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7336)|

| 2:02:20| situation, difficult challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7340)|

| 2:02:42| opportunity along with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| and those who are currently in office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| to turn that around, to make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7366)|

| 2:05:05| not going to let them be overlooked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7505)|

| 2:05:15| Veterans Administration Nursing Home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7515)|

| 2:06:03| charge. Those are all positive type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| things. Today though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7565)|

| 2:06:21| move forward and today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7581)|

| 2:06:31| can either fight with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| we can have lots of political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| bickering, lots of grandstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| and as a result our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| will suffer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| we can go forward on a more progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| path where we forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7603)|

| 2:06:51| of all of our citizens. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| path I plan on taking and that's the path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070131appointmentsswearingin?start=7613)|
