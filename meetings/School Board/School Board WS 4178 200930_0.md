| 0:00:32| moment of silence and the pledge led by Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=32)|
| 0:00:38| Moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=38)|
| 0:00:56| Please face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=58)|
| 0:01:03| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| We have a few announcements. The board met in executive session this afternoon at 4.30pm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| with the law department representatives. Mr. Dupler, would you mind sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| just general information regarding what those sessions entail for the public's benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Absolutely. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| The board meets every so often, usually quarterly, with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| to discuss pending and or anticipated litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| That's a time that has been set aside in state law through case law that the board can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| The board members do not deliberate during that time and it is only a time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| attorneys such as myself or my colleagues from the law office to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| describe the litigation to board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| And that's all that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| All right. Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| And I'd like to thank the board members, KCF staff and other stakeholders who attended our two-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=134)|
| 0:02:20| annual workshop last Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| The workshop was very productive and we have a list of action items that we'll be working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| over the next several months, but I did want to specifically follow up on our discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| the strategic plan and keeping focus on our vision and mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| And our vision is to grow lifelong learners who contribute their talents, strengths and skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| This statement outlines where we want to be and our mission and how we can get there is to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| excellent and accessible learning opportunities that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| And I just want to encourage fellow board members, Superintendent Thomas and staff, our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| families and all community members to keep our vision and mission at the forefront of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| and plans as we make them and when thinking about our schools and community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| So we're going to hear the vision and mission statement a lot going forward over the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| As Superintendent Thomas has stated many times, we are doing great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| especially in comparison to other Tennessee and out-of-state districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| but we know that we can certainly do better and I hope that we can all pledge to make every effort to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| So thanks again for those very productive meetings that we had last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| Our October meetings consist of a regular voting session on October 7th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| and a quarterly work session on October 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Both meetings will be held in this room at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Board members, I did want to let you know that our Coalition of Large School Systems class representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| will be joining us at our October 28th work session to provide the annual legislative update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| And those are all the announcements. Do we have any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Any discussion? All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| Okay, and Superintendent Thomas, we can have your report now, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board, a few updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| I would like to begin once more by thanking our administrators, teachers, students, families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| and school employees for all their hard work to resume instruction this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Can you believe six and a half weeks as of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| So wonderful, it's been a great opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| We expected it to be a challenge and it has been, but it's been a great success overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| and that could not have happened without the tremendous efforts by our school communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| both online and in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| I know that families are anxious for guidance about spring semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| and I'm happy to announce that Knox County Schools will continue to offer two learning options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| in the semester that begins on January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Students can choose in-person, on-campus instruction with additional safety measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| to prevent the spread of COVID-19, or they can enroll in our virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| If families are happy with their current choice, they do not, and I repeat, do not need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| So let me say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| If parents are happy, families are happy with their current choice, you will not need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| However, families that want to switch their learning model from virtual to in-person instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| or from in-person to virtual must do so between October 26th and November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| I'll repeat those dates again, from October 26th through November 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| So please be thinking right now and not wait until November 3rd to make a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=358)|
| 0:06:06| So give that a lot of attention over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| And we'll have more details about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| It will be an online form for you, and we'll share more details about that process very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=374)|
| 0:06:20| So we'll be communicating that quite a bit over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| We have taken a number of significant steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| and to protect the health and safety of our students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| I want to emphasize that the most effective learning happens in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| when a teacher is in the classroom with his or her students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| I'm asking our families to please keep this in mind over the next few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| as they think about what option will work best for their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| So again, the best model is the in-person model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| I know parents want to also have the option of virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| but the very best and most effective learning takes place with the teacher and the students in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| While our commitment is to continue with in-person learning in a safe and healthy manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| there's always a possibility that a decision is made to move to RED in a school or grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| So remind parents and families again, please be sure that you make appropriate plans for your child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| in the event that this should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| On a related note, as our district deployed Chromebooks to all students in grades K through 12 this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| issues of digital citizenship and student safety have taken on a more important role than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| Board members and KCS families have had questions about how we are protecting our students in this new world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| We want parents to know that content filtering software is installed on all student Chromebooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| whether they're working in the school environment or outside of the school environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| While families cannot install software on the district devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| we want to support parents and guardians in helping our students be safe and responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| We will be sending out some information in my weekly message, hopefully this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| to help families understand the risks and the measures they can take to address these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| I also want to remind everyone that families who need assistance with Internet service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| can find a list of providers with standard and low-cost options on our website, www.knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=494)|
| 0:08:23| That flyer is available by clicking on the button marked Chromebooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Also, let me give you two phone numbers if you need Internet assistance, 594-4484,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| and for the virtual learning program, 594-8410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| Also, you can accomplish that by phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| And finally, I'd like to make a respectful request to our students and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| As I said in a recent message to our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| I'm always very grateful when parents and guardians work with educators to support student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| However, I just want to remind our families that teachers are carrying a heavy load right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| and may not respond immediately to email messages, particularly when they're sent after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Please remember that our teachers are family members, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| and they, as all of us, are experiencing the stressful effects of this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| While our district expects teachers to be responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| we also want to pursue a healthy and sustainable lifestyle for our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| and sometimes that will mean waiting until the next day to respond to messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| And I want to thank our parents and families for their understanding and for their support of our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| And Madam Chair, members of the Board, this concludes my report for this evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| And I have a message here. I want to make sure that the choice deadline dates are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| So the opening date is October 26th, and the last day to make that choice would be November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| So to make sure we have that correct date, the 6th, November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| So that would be two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Is that a Friday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Yes, that's a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Yeah, so anyway, so November 6th would be the last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| So to reiterate, don't wait until November 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| The window opens on October 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Okay, and now I would like to call on Ms. Renee Kelly, and she is going to introduce our Teacher Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=615)|
| 0:10:23| Chief of Staff Renee Kelly, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=623)|

| 0:10:28| Come on down. I feel like a talk show host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Madam Chair and members of the board, I'd like to first share with you the purpose of the TAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| and then I will be introducing TAC members that are present with us this evening that will be serving on the Teacher Advisory Council for school year 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=636)|
| 0:10:47| The purpose of the TAC is to provide an important voice for educators in the district's decision making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| and to provide the superintendent with teachers' insights, suggestions, and perspectives on critical educational issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=654)|
| 0:11:02| The TAC will enable better educational and administrative decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| and ultimately, the reason we're all here, will lead to greater student learning and success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| In an effort to support social distancing this evening, I will introduce the members that are present tonight in two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=673)|

| 0:13:34| So those are our TAC representatives for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Thank you for allowing me to celebrate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Their voices are very much appreciated for all of those other teachers that they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| So thank you to all those members who are spending time voicing concerns and opinions on behalf of other teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=827)|
| 0:13:56| Okay. We'll go through our agenda for our October 7th regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| But I also wanted to remind you that Item 10B has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| AT&T alerted staff that the National Perching Cooperative Contract referred to in that item is actually expiring today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| So we will not be considering the use of that contract at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Can I ask a question about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Do we have another source of hotspots since we're obviously not doing them through AT&T?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| We have two other sources of hotspots, and this was just to give us some further redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Okay. We will move to items and contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Do we have any questions on 1, 2, or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| Okay. 4, 5, or 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| 7 or 8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| 9 or 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| Okay. And then moving into board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| We've reviewed these at our policy review meeting a couple weeks ago, so we have discussed these thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=915)|
| 0:15:23| But are there questions on policy I-341?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=923)|
| 0:15:34| Policy I-351?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| Policy I-373?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| J-130?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| J-150?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| J-151?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| J-194?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| J-280?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| J-400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| J-580?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Okay. And then we'll move to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Any questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| Questions on E or F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| Okay. Moving to contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Any questions on A or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| This seems to me to be an example of what we've been seeing more and more recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| and that is the contract that we approve, and then later it comes up again for us to approve the money for that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| The fiscal note says that there's no cost at this time and no impact on general purpose funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| Yet the description of the type of funding source says if contracts are used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| the funding sources could be Title I, Title II, Title IV, and general purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| So eventually, if we use this contract, then there obviously is an impact on general purpose funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1022)|
| 0:17:11| I'm not sure why we would approve a contract that we're not considering using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| So having that possible funding source but not any kind of potential cost doesn't seem to be very fiscally responsible of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1036)|
| 0:17:28| and I would like to see us not consider items that don't have full information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| So if we could either remove that until we have the information or get the information in time for next week, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1055)|
| 0:17:48| My real ask would be that we not put things like this on the agenda when we don't have full information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Shannon Jackson, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| So I believe – are we – Ms. Owen, are you talking about item C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| I'm addressing the right question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| So when we are talking about our advanced academic programs, this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| This is Cambridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| So when we were looking at launching Cambridge, in order for a school to consider it, we have to have a contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| We actually have two schools that do want to engage with Cambridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| and we will be able to put some Title II-A dollars and some Title IV dollars to be able to, with the carryover funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| to be able to let them do some training and be ready to open as a Cambridge school in next fall, so fall 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| So that's where the – that's the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| The question is, what would be the potential cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| So we would be looking at spending about $30,000 in Title IV for them to do training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| and have some materials to be able to open the Cambridge program at Carter High School and South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| Is that per program, per school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| That's total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| And that's just Title IV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| What about the – are there other funds that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| We don't have other funds that we need to spend for opening that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Cambridge will allow us to do a class at a time, so as teachers are ready to do the training and ready to open with their class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| they would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| There would be other potential costs along the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| There wouldn't be other training costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| It's just the $30,000 straight flat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Ms. Jackson, if other schools wanted to participate, then perhaps that's where general funding could come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| That's correct, which is why we put in the fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| We were trying to be as transparent as we knew how to be, that right now these are the two schools that are interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and so this is how we're budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| But as other schools are interested, we would be willing to consider those funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| and then we would be bringing that back to you before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Is it like AP that as you do a course, I mean, it's kind of course by course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| a teacher would just – if they wanted to add, say, the English to the Cambridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| the teacher at that point would get trained in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| So there is going to be training costs along the way, but it can be chosen as needed or as funding as available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| So is it fair to say that this contract allows us to work with Cambridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| and then the costs are determined as we engage in that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| In terms of the number of the schools or classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Ms. Owen, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| If other schools chose to do it, the cost would be if there was one training for multiple schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| it's that $30,000 number, or would that be per school that came in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| It's per teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| So we pay per teacher to participate in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| If we can get enough teachers, then we can bring a trainer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| We've tried to partner with Metro Nashville because they also have Cambridge programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| and have some trainers, so if we can reduce our costs by doing some collaboration there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| But it's not $30,000 per teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| The way it's set up to make somebody pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Oh, no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| And the price differs depending on whether or not it is a virtual training or an in-person training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| Right now we're doing everything virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| But the $30,000 will cover all of the training plus any materials they may need to open in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| For those first two schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| For those first two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| And we'll move to regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Any questions on A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Questions on B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Ms. Spab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| I guess I just, I mean, can I just get a little bit of explanation about what the special question committee is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Superintendent Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Dr. Russell is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Rodney Russell is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| And I don't know, too, Gary might, depending on what the questions are, might be able to help from a legal perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thanks, Rodney, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Madam Chair, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| The special question committee is something that is built into the Professional Educators Collaborative Conferencing Act of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1340)|
| 0:22:29| So we just, you all just approved an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| And the process that starts the new collaborative team to begin taking on an agenda is the special questions committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1353)|
| 0:22:44| So the special questions committee is charged with managing the logistics and just the secret ballot and the vote that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1364)|
| 0:22:53| They will also certify the election, certify the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| And we have in the past, you as a board, have appointed three or had three of you on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1378)|
| 0:23:08| and then there will be three from the Professional Educators Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| And typically it takes about two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| We have one to set up the election and make the decision on how it's going to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| and then a second meeting where you have to come back and certify the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you, Mr. Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Moving to item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| And item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Superintendent Thomas, can you just clarify what it is that you're proposing to give back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| The way I understand it is that we're actually giving something back that was taken away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| but this is not an admission to the base salary for our contractor, 255 employees, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| The folks that worked the 255 contracts gave up five days for this current year to help with their anticipated budget shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| So this actually restores the five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| It puts these individuals back in the same place that they were in in the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| It's not a salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| And I can assure the Board, too, that folks have probably worked many times over the five days that they were going to take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| The five days, the work still has to be done no matter when it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| So, again, it's just restoring these folks to where they were in the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Superintendent Thomas, would you want to talk about the health insurance, what that means for employees also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| I'd be glad to talk about the health insurance, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| And part of our memorandum of understanding is that we pay a percentage on the health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| and what the Board has done over the past few years is maintain the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| And by doing that, we are actually following what the MOU calls for, prescribed that we would continue to pay the same percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1507)|
| 0:25:17| There is an increase for the employee as well as an increase for the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Initially, when we were talking about this, the employee was going to have the full cost of the increase, which is 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| And we were thinking back during early budget conversations, the word was a 7% increase, which obviously would have been a heavy hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1531)|
| 0:25:39| But it ended up being a 2% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| So just to give you an example, I think on the most expensive plan, if the Board did not pay their share of the increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1542)|
| 0:25:52| the premium on our most expensive plan would have gone up $33 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| But with the Board paying their share, then that increase is $12.71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| So there's quite a bit of difference between the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And for an employee, an individual, the increase would have been $13 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| But with the Board paying their share, the increase is $3.72 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| Just to give you two kind of extreme examples there with the premium increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| So this is something we talked about in the budget approval process, that if the revenues were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| the projections were going to be better than what we thought, that we would like to come back and revisit this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| and do this for our employees as well as the furlough day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| So it was a commitment that I made to our employees to bring back to the Board the restoration of both of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1597)|
| 0:26:46| And the insurance, I think, is about $170,000 for the Board's share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| And then on the 255 days, roughly about $700,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| But again, just for public consumption, this is not a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| It's just giving folks back what they already had that we took away from them in the budget process earlier in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1622)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Let me say one other thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| We talked a little bit about this at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| And what I'd like to do is continue to look at the revenues over the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| We have one data point at this point in time in terms of the new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| But when we get another data point or two to look at it and talk with our PECA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1648)|
| 0:27:36| with our negotiation teams, our collaborative conferencing teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| if we could come back and do something like a bonus for all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| if revenues were to be there to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| then we'd like to consider that just so that we could try to do something for all of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Because, again, on our strategic plan, compensation is one of our goals, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| that we, from the positive culture standpoint, that we compensate our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| And we were unable to give a salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| We gave step increases to eligible employees this year, but we did not give a salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| So if there's a possibility of doing something like a bonus, talk to our teams about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| and then bring that back to the board sometime within the next couple of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| again, if revenues continue to trend upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Mr. Thomas, just for the public's information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| the reason we were able to do these things is because the revenues were much higher than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I want to ask you about that last item, the five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| And I don't disagree with you as far as how hard they worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| I know that they did work really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| But what if the reason that you did that, I think, was, you know, if we thought we were going to need it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1753)|
| 0:29:40| and then we talked just a little bit about waiting until the end of the year to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1780)|
| 0:29:48| or later and see what the revenues were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1788)|
| 0:29:56| If you have a, and if you do, tell me what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| If we go ahead and spend this money and we should need it, what's the backup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1803)|
| 0:30:14| Well, if you recall, too, we anticipated spending into fund balance, I think, to the extent of about $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| And projections right now is we're not going to be spending into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| So, you know, that money, and we feel like through turnover, employee turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| that we will have the salary, the money in the salary accounts to cover the $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| So I think we're, and Ron can talk more specifically about it probably than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| but those were the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| And it looks like that actually at the close of last year we're going to put money into fund balance, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| to the extent of about $4.9 million instead of spending into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| So we feel like from the salary account standpoint that we have money to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| And, you know, nobody can predict the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| But, you know, made a commitment to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| If it was there, I would come back to the Board with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| You know, if we, hopefully this situation is not going to be as dire next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| but, you know, if it's something we had to do, you know, we had to do again in order to balance the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| then, you know, I'd come back to the Board and say, hey, here's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| But I just don't, you know, in fairness to the employees and to keep my commitment to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1890)|
| 0:31:37| when I said, hey, if the revenue is there, you know, we'll go back to the Board to ask for this to be restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| And, Ron, let me let you, I know you talked a little bit about the projections, you know, for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| but even for this year, you can talk about fund balance a little bit and salary accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| So when we had originally talked about potentially revisiting this later on in the year, when we said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| I don't think anyone, no economist in the country that I had any information that I had read from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| or anyone we consulted with, UT, the state, or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| even imagined that the economy would be as good as what it turned out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| And, yeah, anything can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Mr. Thomas is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| I can tell you that for July sales tax, this July was $1.6 million than last July before COVID even hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1947)|
| 0:32:38| This July was the greatest rate of consumer spending in the history of Knox County for that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| So it's just far better than what we could have imagined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Anything can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| But we also have $25 million in cash reserves, so we have a pretty healthy fund balance at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Now, again, $15 million of that is reserved for emergency spending, which is, you know, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| We never want to go into that 3 percent, which is $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| But we have $9 million, projected $9 million over and above that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| in addition to the sales tax received over the spring months, $15 million more than what we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=1990)|
| 0:33:20| And then we also budgeted extremely conservatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| We budgeted $10 million less in the current fiscal year in sales tax revenue than what we actually collected for this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| So I think a combination of those items, we feel pretty good about moving forward with this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2012)|
| 0:33:43| My concern is that, and I think both of you all have done a good job of explaining it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2023)|
| 0:33:55| but explaining it here and when it gets out to the public and if those that care, if they realize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2035)|
| 0:34:06| I know you were very careful to say it was not a raise or anything, and you did say that we were going to restore it sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2046)|
| 0:34:22| And I hope the economy, you know, continues to get better, but nobody knows what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2062)|
| 0:34:33| As you said, I just thought about that it might be better if we waited until later, a little bit later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2073)|
| 0:34:46| I think that's what you had originally in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| I mean, we haven't talked specifically about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| But when you said I will restore it if the money is available, you were thinking not in too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2094)|
| 0:35:05| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| And, right, I wasn't expecting the kind of results that I guess we've gotten thus far either, you know, at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2107)|
| 0:35:16| I didn't see this coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I don't think anybody did, as Ron said, because we were projecting to spend into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| But as Ron said, you know, things are actually better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| And I understand that may not be the trend all year long, but, you know, I just felt like, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| I've made a commitment to our folks to bring it back to the Board and do that now because we do project the revenues to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2132)|
| 0:35:41| I think it's more meaningful, you know, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| It obviously would be meaningful in April, but I know we'll be right in the middle of budget conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| and discussions in April, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| And to do just, in my mind, made more sense to, you know, to come back to the Board at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2151)|
| 0:35:59| and do it sooner rather than later because, you know, again, these folks have made a sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| I know there are people, the pandemic has hit folks, and some folks, you know, have lost jobs, don't have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| But, you know, our folks, our employees have worked extremely hard to make all this happen, the in-person learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2171)|
| 0:36:21| the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| I know our teachers have worked extremely hard, too, in fatigue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| That's why, you know, I'd like to come back to the Board if we can to do something like a bonus for our teachers and our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| Everybody has worked extremely hard to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| And, you know, I just think that they deserve to, first of all, they don't deserve to be making less than they made last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2199)|
| 0:36:48| And that's why I think it's important to go ahead and do it at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| And certainly whatever the Board approves, you know, we'll comply with what the Board approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| So if you want to, if that's your wishes, you know, to delay it, we'll delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| But I know, you know, folks would like to have it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| It goes back to July, you know, the paychecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| It hit paychecks starting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| So by December there will be six months' worth of, you know, worth of sacrifice that folks have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| And I just would appreciate your consideration to restore it and then to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| to let us go ahead and do it now for the month of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Mr. McPherson, this question is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| When we made the budget, we, I mean, obviously nobody knew what was going to happen with the economy when you're making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| But the projections for the whole year we projected to be down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| So July happened to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| So we don't even have to do great to be better than probably the projections were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| So, I mean, we don't have to have like blockbuster months to actually do well and beat our budget numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| Very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| And also I will add not only did we budget conservatively in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| we budgeted conservatively expenditures because we budgeted $4 million less in expenditures in anticipation of COVID expenditures hitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2289)|
| 0:38:19| So even the fact that we have COVID expenditures that are also hitting that are unbudgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| we've covered a lot of that through just in our budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| Do you have a follow-up to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Just out of curiosity, the people that you talked to and all the things you read, this was so above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2314)|
| 0:38:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Is there any kind of consensus as to why it was like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| No, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I would not necessarily characterize it as a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| There's been a lot of people that are trying to figure this thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| In fact, sales tax, it never really took a hit from the very beginning, even in April and May and June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2343)|
| 0:39:12| And what really, and I'll get to your question here in a second, what makes this very difficult is it's not in real time, this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| So we receive the information because of the nature of sales tax, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| The state portion and the local option portion, it changes hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| And so it's two months later we really get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| And so people opine, for instance, that, again, there's a lot of online sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2373)|
| 0:39:44| Also, there's a notion that maybe part of this is attributed to the fact of the unemployment from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| that maybe people, even if they lost jobs, they really didn't experience any kind of loss of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| In fact, some people were making more, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| So there's some opinion there that maybe that contributed to it, and likely it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| But I think the fact that it's even greater, it's not only better than expected, it's better than last year at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2411)|
| 0:40:19| And we've talked about this before, I couldn't leave my neighborhood without seeing a Lowe's truck or a Home Depot truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| I even had one in my own driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| So everybody was in the Lowe's or the Home Depot mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Because some people were, now you're working from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| So now I'm online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| So I would not say there's a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| There's a lot of, I think, surprise, and a lot of people are still trying to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| Really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| All those things that you said make perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| And with people at home having time on their hands, they have a tendency to drift toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2456)|
| 0:41:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| And, Mr. Thomas, did you want to add something, and then we'll go to Mr. Watson's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| I think it's important to look at it this way, too, if you don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| People are going to, they will be working five additional days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| They're just getting paid for it instead of working the days they're not getting paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| So I don't know if that helps with the explanation or not, but I think that's important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| It's not we're giving anybody anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| They're working for this, for these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Now they're going to pay them for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Mr. McPherson, I don't want to continue to belabor this, but I think it's important for the public to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| I've had some people ask me questions about, you know, our teachers are working really hard, too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| I think it's important, again, just to reiterate, what we're saying is we're taking money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| We've taken money out of people's wallets that we're willing to put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| We're not, like, giving money and adding money to people's wallets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| I think that's important to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| And then the other thing is, correct me if my math is wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| if we took that $700,000 and gave every teacher the same raise, it would be about one-quarter percent of a raise, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| So we all know they've been working just as hard as our 255-day contract employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| And I'm looking forward to the opportunity where you all get to come back to us sometime here in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| where we're able to do something for them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| That's our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| And I'll just say, if I'm not mistaken, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| 255-day employees have been in the same position of having a salary reduction at some point in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| I don't know exactly when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| There's been two instances, maybe over the last 20 years, where there's been a day taken away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| or I think five days maybe at one point even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| And I'm not sure that it's always been added back, even if it had been indicated that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| So the fact that the superintendent made that statement, that he would add it back if at all possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| and we have the resources, to me, I want to support the superintendent's stance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| because I feel like that's the commitment that he made, and so I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I believe in both of those instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| I think one predated me, but I believe in both of those instances it went the full year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| and it was not reinstated until the following budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| So Bob would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| He could remember that a lot better than I could, but, yeah, I think it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| And, again, you start competing for budgetary initiatives, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| And so if we think we have the funding stream, it's, I think, better to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Mr. Watson, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| If we have no other questions, we will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Yes, I'd like to call Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2632)|
| 0:44:11| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| Good evening, Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Members of the board, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| I want to call your attention to policies J400 and 580.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| J400, abuse and neglect, appears to be motivated by changes in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| The policy revision adds requirements for each school to have a child abuse coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| and an alternate child abuse coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| It seems like a really good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Most staff are trained at some level about child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Dealing with abused children requires an expertise we can't expect from general training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Unfortunately, this revision to the policy falls short of what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| The first improvement would be to add requirements that the district maintained on its website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| a complete list of child abuse coordinators and alternates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| With contact information, parents, teachers, and students need to know where to get prompt help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| Also, the policy fails to include the requirements for child abuse coordinator training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| and instructions on how coordinators and staff are to interact with children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| and third parties about abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| This is actually in the law, but it didn't choose to include it into the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Few of us know how properly to handle cases of child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| The state law that motivates this revision spells out specific guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| that the staff and parents should have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| The right place for that guidance is in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| I'd encourage you to withdraw J400 and prepare a complete update that better serves schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Now, J580, student suicide prevention, has different problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| Fortunately, nearly all of us are completely unprepared to deal with suicide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| because we've never experienced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| It's an area where we all need expert help immediately when we learn about a child in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| The policy requires each principal to designate a school suicide prevention coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| However, there's nothing in the policy that says what the coordinator's responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| A search of the KCS website found the phrase only in the policy, only in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| If these coordinators actually exist, parents, students, and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| should immediately be able to identify and contact the school's suicide prevention coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| The policy should be revised to make clear the qualifications and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| of the suicide prevention coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| and require that student support services post on its website the names and contact information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| for every school's suicide prevention coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| Schools should do the same thing for theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| The section on intervention casts more doubt on the existence of suicide prevention coordinators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| The policy says that if a student is thought to be a suicide risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| quote, suicide threat assessment will be completed by a school counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| a school psychologist, or a school social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| Where is the suicide prevention coordinator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| Just as concerning is that nothing in the policy defines what a suicide threat assessment is or how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| A search of the KCS website provided no other use for the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| While it may sound good to talk about suicide threat assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| how is the crisis team supposed to do one without guidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| The policy needs to be revised to define clearly what and how to respond to a student in crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| In the postvention section, the policy says immediately following a student's suicide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| the school or district crisis team shall meet and develop a postvention plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| The crisis team sounds like just the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| But what is it and what expertise do its members bring to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Why isn't the suicide prevention coordinator on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200930?start=2857)|
