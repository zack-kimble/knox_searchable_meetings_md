| 0:06:42| multidisciplinary team that's represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=402)|

| 0:06:54| Do we know if it's coming up? Chairman Beeler, I was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| aware that we needed to have this presentation up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| I have sent it over to Mark Barber, but I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| if he can get it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Mark, how's it going over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| Yep, yeah. Okay, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| go ahead and walk through it. Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| As I mentioned, I've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| work in Knox County for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| gosh, almost 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| now. Better part of 10 or 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| And so when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| we kicked off this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| staff was kind enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| give us, some of the folks on our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| are not as familiar as I am with the county, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| were kind enough to give us a tour of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| county. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| it's really remarkable to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| the amount of growth that's happened since I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| first started working here about 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| or 15 years ago. A lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| of new developments have come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| and each one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| explicitly or not, was the result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| some type of decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| that was made. So the developments just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| happen. Some type of decision would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| So, you know, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| next 10 years, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| will be many more decisions that have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| There will be many more developments that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| And, you know, decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| about infrastructure. How are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| going to make those decisions? What type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| of information will you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| guys need at your disposal to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| to make wise and prudent decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| That's exactly what this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| is designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| It's intended to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| you the information that you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| to chart the long-term future for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| so that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| decisions that are in the best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| So does that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| will there be enough infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| there? Is it going to achieve fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| balance? Is it in line with our vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| for the county? Those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| all the types of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| that the comprehensive planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| will answer. So it's going to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| as a blueprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| So this will lay out, you know, how we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| like to see the county develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| over the next, you know, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| decades. There we go. Thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| much for bringing it up. We're on the second slide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| it's a playbook. So when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| get to those very specific decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| it's going to give us the types of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| that we can make informed, data-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| decisions. But it's also a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| for communication so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| when we make the types of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| that we do, it's very clear and transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| to our residents and constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| why we made those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| And so that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| these decisions are going to be made whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| we choose to make them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| And this gives, the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| gives us a cohesive vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| to make those types of informed decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| why now? Why are we having a comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| plan now? Well, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| we've seen a significant amount of growth in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| and that demand or growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| will continue into the future. You can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| and go to the next slide now. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| we have a unique opportunity to help shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| and guide that future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| And so, that's what the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| as part of that, to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| how we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| sure that we retain our local character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| There are three main ingredients to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| There's a land use component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| and a transportation component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| And the reason why that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| developing plans for these simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| is I'm sure you all are aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| when we make transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| decisions, the land use is absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| going to follow. It's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| coincidence that a lot of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| major developments follow major corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| because that's just typically how growth happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| And vice versa. So when we make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| when we build new developments, they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| to have demands on our transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| So therefore, it only makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| sense to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| long-term decisions about land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| in combination with each other, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| understand how they influence each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| As a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| element, we had a unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| to also include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| parks and recreation too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| So our parks partners have joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| understand how growth and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| will influence demand for parks and recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| over the long term as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| So not only will this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| you know, make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| and plans for land use and transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| but also for the long-term future of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| You can go ahead and go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| Yep, that's good. You can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| to the next slide here. This is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Yep. So there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| a number of different, I think, elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| of the plan that we want to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| as part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| You know, for one, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| when we make wise and prudent land use and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| transportation decisions, it's going to result in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| positive economic development in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| that we want it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| You know, we want to make sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| type of development that we propose in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| is responsive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| the needs of the environment and that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| making, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| sustainable decisions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| We want to make sure that we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| affordable options for people in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| we want to make sure that we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| workforce opportunities as well. So all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| different elements come into play as part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| So there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| are a number of different ways that this is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| to unfold over the next several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| years. As I mentioned, this is a very...you can go to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| slide. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| really important and broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| and encompassing plan. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| our schedule will play out over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| couple of years. As I mentioned, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| at the very front end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So we're sort of in the plan preparation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| We have not yet started a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| with the community. We'll talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| more about that in a minute. But that's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| coming up next is that we're sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| in a fact-finding phase right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| And then we'll get ready to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| in one of three rounds of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| And then we'll start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| contemplate what our future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| might look like over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| year or so. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| in 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| probably about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| this time in 2023 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| when we'll adopt the plan. So there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| plenty of opportunities for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| to interact with you all and with other stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| So where are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| at right now? As I mentioned, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| can go to the next slide. We just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| yeah, here's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| important part. So as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| I mentioned, we'll have a number of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| conversations over the course of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| plan development. And we have a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| of different parties involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| this. So we've got technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| committees that are laid out. And as part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| we have subcommittees that will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| important topics like schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| and utilities and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| You all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| county staff, they're an important part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| of the process. We're developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| an advisory committee to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| guide the process that will be citizen-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| You all may have seen the emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| that were sent out recently about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| We're looking to seat between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| 20 and 25 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| on that advisory committee. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| the good news is we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| recruiting earlier this week and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| gotten to date 44| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| applications. So the demand has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| been overwhelming, which is extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| positive. We're going to closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| review the applications and make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| that we achieve a committee that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| diverse and distributed so that all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| your districts are represented and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| we have a representative cross-section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| of the county on that advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| So where we are right now in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| you can go to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| as I mentioned, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| our kick-off tour last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We're in the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| figuring out where we are as a county right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| state of the county, a fact-finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| phase. That's in process right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| now. And then we're getting ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| to start the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| The parks component is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| actually a little bit ahead of us. They've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| started their public engagement part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| They distributed an online survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| last month that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| already generated 2,000 responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| which is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| exciting that we're getting that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| of participation. But that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| sort of where we are right now in the process. We're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| in the preparation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| But very quickly, we're going to shift gears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| and we're going to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| our first round of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| engagement. And as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| if you want to go to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| we are building the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| process around three rounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| of public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| So it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| a single meeting. It's a series of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| around the county. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| engagement online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| on the website. It's a number of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| discussions with individual stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| All those types of things will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| held within each of three rounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| that are designed to occur at key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| milestones in the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Round number one is coming up in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| So we're getting ready to kick that off. So I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| you'll be hearing a lot more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| very soon. And then if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| go to the next slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| yeah, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| will give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| a little more detail on where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| in the process. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| as I mentioned, we're in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| we're sort of in a listening and learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| phase right now. We're briefing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| the different bodies that are involved. Certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| you all. Last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| week, we briefed Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| and the Planning Commission. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| a briefing of the city is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| on tap. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| coming up next month, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| start to get into our stakeholder interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| We'll convene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| the advisory committee that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| just talked about and the technical committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| of staff. And we'll begin those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| conversations as well. So you'll be hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| a lot more about this in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| So that's sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| just a quick overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| of the project, where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| right now and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| We're certainly this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| probably the largest planning effort that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| the county has ever undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| And so we're really excited to partner with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| you all on it. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| happy to share a little more information with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| all today. With that, I'm going to stop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| see if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| Commissioner Schmidt. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| you, Mr. Chairman. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| sir. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| You guys did our ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| or ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| transition plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| and it was based upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| codes and deficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| easy identifiable codes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| deficiencies. From where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| and how do you make your assumptions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| housing trends, transportation modes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| and the type of recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| facilities that will be needed that far into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| future? That's a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| question. So the ADA transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| plan, as you mentioned, is very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| So it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| it's very objective that we can quickly identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| those and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| yep. So this you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| right. Planning so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| in the future is a little more subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| And so one of the ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| we help inform that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| is through what's called scenario planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| And so we're going to look at it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| a handful of different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| for the future in terms of, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| know, here are different ways that our county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| future can play out. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| part of that, we can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| how different I think you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| different modes of transportation. So as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| part of that process, we can get a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| of how different modes of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| will be accommodated. So, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| if we develop in a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| how many residents could walk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| a park or could walk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| you know, activities or shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| or to employment opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| or, you know, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| feasible would biking be based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| on the way the development is put together? And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| we can use that information to help make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| about where we want to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| our transportation investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| and decide where land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| you know, makes the most sense to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| But that is through, so we'll consider a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| of different scenarios and then make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| on how those scenarios play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Okay. And this might be a tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| question, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| how do you keep from simply making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| a citizen's wish list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| and put together a plan that's focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| and obtainable with goals that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| actually be reached?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| And so that is another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| great question, and that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| specific ask of your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| when they put together this procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| is that this is a plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| needs to be grounded in data and analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And one of the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| that we're doing that is through what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| fiscal analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| And so that essentially ensures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| that the type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| and infrastructure that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| at for the future will generate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| the type of revenue to offset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| the cost of that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| And so as part of this, that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| data points as part of the scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| is that we'll, you know, under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| different development patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| we want to make sure that the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| can, you know, can offset the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1186)|

| 0:19:52| And so that's what the fiscal impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| will achieve. Okay. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| what other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1196)|

| 0:20:38| few examples of some of the county plans that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| done. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| for anyone who hasn't taken a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1242)|

| 0:20:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair. This sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| all intriguing and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| We had a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| last week with our legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| group in Nashville, and we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| about transportation, how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| interconnect. Now, will you be taking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| consideration how we're going to connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| with other cities and towns from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| Knoxville from here and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| we can get our traffic there, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| kind of going through Knoxville out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| out of the main cities out here without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| so much traffic jam. You mean traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| doesn't start and end within the county line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Yeah, I've been on I-40 West. I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| the traffic that's going out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Oak Ridge. And yeah, we can't ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| the fact that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| doesn't exist in a vacuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| and there's a lot of different demand that goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| on between other communities. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| mentioned Oak Ridge, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and Anderson County. So yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| that's a great point, and we need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| And right here, without not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| having the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| area to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| large masses of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| you know, like big plants, like what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| they've just done in Memphis in the Ford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| will you be taking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| consideration how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| take those other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| around us that have developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| land for manufacturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| and that sort of thing, and how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| help our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| to piggyback on those lands outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| of the county line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| So I think your question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| you know, looking at, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| you mentioned the Blue Oval project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| out in Memphis, that there may be other opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| that may not be in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| specifically, but might be just outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| that could influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| We hadn't specifically thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| about that, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| is a great point that I think that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| definitely take into consideration when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| develop a plan. So yes, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| take that into consideration. So looking at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| of the other larger economic development opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| in Loudoun or Anderson or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Blount and how that might impact Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Commissioner Bussler. Any other questions from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1386)|

| 0:23:10| for that presentation. I think all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| of us would agree this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| may be the most important thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| this commission or all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| involved will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1400)|

| 0:24:08| As you all know, I recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| created a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Mental Health Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1452)|

| 0:24:16| the viability of a mental health court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Estimates are that up to 35%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| of our average daily jail population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| is mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| That means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| 75% of our jail population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1470)|

| 0:24:34| This is not only clogging up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| our system, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| expensive, it's ineffective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| and it is a poor use of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| safety resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| So I believe it is imperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| that we provide alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| pathways for these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| besides the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| traditional criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| So I'd like to thank Commission for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| I thank the committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| for their work, and I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| especially like to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Criminal Court Clerk Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| This is his brainchild, and he's taken the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| So at this point, if it's okay, I'd like to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| the floor over to Clerk Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1512)|

| 0:25:20| I'm going to ask my assistant, Elizabeth Golem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| to give you some information, and while she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| doing that, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| tell you how this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Tell you how this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Back in 2019, I had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| of going to Brooklyn because Brooklyn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| had the very first mental health court in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| United States. I thought, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| see what they're doing, and let's see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| we might be able to take a look at their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| successes and their failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| Had a chance to meet with the judge, had a chance to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| their case managers, their attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| and actually had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| sit in court while they were doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Their success rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| after 15 years is 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Seven out of every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1556)|

| 0:26:04| there are nine counties that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| have a mental health court. Nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| there are 450 communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| that have a mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| In your packets, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| to find some materials that will help you better understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| the mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| courts, how it will operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| and just some basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| information for you as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| begin this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Basically, in Brooklyn, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| and in other communities that we've talked with, how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| works is, an individual would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| recommended for the mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| At that point, case managers would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| interview this individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| and then it would be up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| the case manager to present it to the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| and at that point, the judge, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| attorney general, and the public defender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| and other members of the legal community would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| yes, this person is eligible for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| Not everyone would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| As you might imagine, there are some mental illnesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| where this would not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| In most communities, they start out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| with misdemeanors, and then they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| their way up to some felonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Again, the purpose of this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| is to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| an exploratory to see how it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| work in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| The goal, of course, is to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| the number of people that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| go back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| the justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| As the mayor mentioned, 35%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| of the people in the jails right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| have mental health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| This is not the first time this has been recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| by the way, in Knox County. In 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| a report from justice planners on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| jail population in Knox County recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| the establishment of a mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| court. In the executive summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| of a report on the Behavioral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Health and Urgent Care Center, or BHUC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| a mental health court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| was also recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Our goal is to do our due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| talk with a number of people, visit other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| and come back to you as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| with a framework for a possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| mental health court here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1672)|

| 0:28:00| Helen Ross McNabb, President,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Mona Blanton-Kitz, our members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| of the committee, as well as myself. I will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| there's a lot of enthusiasm from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| these people to get the ball rolling on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| because we see tremendous potential for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| This is not a short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| program. This is not something where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| would go in and spend 30, 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| or 90 days. This is a year-long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| program where these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| individuals will hopefully get housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| they will also receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| some employment, and also making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| sure that their medicines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| being administered on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Be watching your emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| because we'll be sending you a link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| to a video from Miami-Dade County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| where they have had tremendous success with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| mental health court. It's a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| it's about an hour long, but you'll find it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| very, very valuable, the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| that you will receive and the successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| that they have received in Miami-Dade County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Hopefully we'll be able to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| same type of success here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| So again, thanks to Mayor Jacobs for taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| the lead on putting this committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| We're on a fast track. We want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| interview a lot of people here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| locally. We want to visit other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| where it's working, but also we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1744)|

| 0:29:08| follow into the same path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Mr. Chairman, again, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| allowing us to be here. I'm not sure that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| to ask you for any type of motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| at this point. We will be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| and at that point I'm sure we'll be asking you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| to take a look at the recommendations that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| have and we can go from there. But I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| happy to answer any questions, knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| that I may not be able to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| them, but hopefully after we've gone through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| exploratory process, we will have more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| for you and can better answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| Are there any questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Mr. Hammond, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| when we were doing the B-HUC here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Miami-Dade County was a county that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| were kind of modeling the B-HUC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Miami-Dade County also had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| a mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| How much of the success to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| B-HUC in Miami-Dade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| County do they contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| to the fact that they also have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| mental health court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| You know, I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| That's one of the things that we're going to be finding out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| because that's one of the places that we want to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| is to go and sit down with them because of the success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| One of the things that I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| and again, I've just heard this, is that they've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| such success, they've been able to close down a pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| in their jail and turn it into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| mental health facility, because they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| people that are not returning and going back into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| So, I'll be happy to answer those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| questions and have that for you when we return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| I was just wondering, what's your timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| on expecting your return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Donna, so your exploratory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| and stuff like that, how long do you think it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| until we get to see it? We're hopeful of within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| four to six months we can be back with something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| because we're not trying to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Other people have done it, they're very successful at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| It's just a matter now of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| taking their successes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| seeing what we can do here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| I will also tell you that General Allen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| is so excited about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| she has asked all, all of her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| staff to get involved. So, I think we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| to have a lot of people that are going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Mr. Lutton is the same way. They're very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| They're going to be putting a lot of resources toward this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| So, I think we'll be able to come back to you sooner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| than later. That's great news. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=1874)|

| 0:40:12| is to benefit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| county with regards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2414)|

| 0:40:20| in my previous positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2420)|

| 0:40:40| policy that explains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| basically what the naming rights policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| will do for the county, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| also there's another section that talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| the actual agreement. In the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2448)|

| 0:40:52| states what the donor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| will donate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2454)|

| 0:41:00| It's a pretty cut and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| dry policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| You'll see it used throughout several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2464)|

| 0:41:22| policy that's been around and been in use for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| quite some time, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| it'll do wonders for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| County and some of the things that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2488)|

| 0:45:38| KPD officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| pulled over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Robert Bailey Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| allegedly for a broken taillight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2748)|

| 0:46:00| that Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| On January 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| at a Knoxville police communication event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| a City Council candidate was arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| by Knox County Sheriff's deputies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| in the very lobby of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| On a Friday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| at a KPD public relations event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| a City Council candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| was arrested by KSCO deputies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| They piled on top of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| and twisted his legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| They refused to answer simple questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| he asked about the reason for his arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| and disappeared him into the custody of the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| where another black man had died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| in police custody the previous night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| This arrest is a blatant violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| of civic trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| David Hayes filed a financial disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| with this correct address in July of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| He stood right here in this very spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| on countless occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| It's not good for freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| for folks to be arrested for speaking their minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And that's what this looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| The other explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| is that for eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| our Sheriff's Department could not find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| a well-known public figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| with a correct address on his financial disclosure statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| And that's not a good look either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Is this what we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Knox County to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| A place where secret warrants are just waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| for folks who speak their mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| If Vice Chairman Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| had an old warrant from an act of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| disobedience from his college days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| would it be okay for the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| to come in here and arrest him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| We need transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| and accountability immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| And the DA has stepped in to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| And I realize that there's not much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| that you guys can do about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| But I encourage you to be bold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| To raise your voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| in support of freedom of speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| and government accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| I would also encourage you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| consider creating a civil oversight board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| similar to the City of Knoxville's Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| or Davidson County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2866)|

| 0:47:50| At the last Knoxville City Council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| the city hired the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Police Executive Research Forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2874)|

| 0:47:58| And PERF publishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| 30 guiding principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| on the use of force that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| are very relevant to what has occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| recently in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| So the first guideline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| the sanctity of human life should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| at the heart of everything an agency does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2892)|

| 0:48:24| in providing information following use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2904)|

| 0:48:30| with effective communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Our Sheriff's Department could learn a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| from these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| I humbly ask that you use your power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| to find the whole truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| in the case of the death of Robert Bailey Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| and in the arrest of David Hayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| and that you share that with your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2924)|

| 0:49:00| So that concludes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2940)|

| 0:49:08| of what responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| a district commissioner has during a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2952)|

| 0:49:18| What brought this to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| to me was a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| disaster like what happened in Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| a few weeks back where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| tornado went through and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| destroyed a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| I know in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| which I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| there's a lot of back roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| and other roads that would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| if something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| happened here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| would take forever to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| into all these different places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| where you know people reside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| that probably do not have the communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| things that we have, cell phones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| and things like that to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| them out to see if they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| What we do have is we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| four responses like for floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| and some other things but a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| disaster like what happened in Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| what would our response be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| What would our responsibility be to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| people in that district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| The major roads would be covered first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| but the people that are back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| in some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| roads and things that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| in my district I know right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| find out when I was running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| for office took a map and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| started going to all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| and found people who voted in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| back roads and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| and I was amazed at some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| houses that I saw back in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| and I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| is there something that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| or would request to do as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| commissioner to go look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| these people to not be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| way but how we could be trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| in a situation like that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| go help these people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| would probably take weeks to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| and find over that wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| of area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| I just thought it was something we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| probably needed to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| and probably decide what we needed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| and have some official come in here and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| well here's what you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| because when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| that situation going one of the first things you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| got to do is get to the people but then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| have downed power lines, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| have other things that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| can be hazardous as you're going out in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| that you'll be looking for and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| I served on a disaster relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| team for my church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| and believe it or not they let me handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| chainsaw but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| it was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| it was very interesting in taking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| training and it's like about a 10 week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| course that you take to how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| do disasters and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| find out about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| buildings and how safe they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| I don't know if we had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| sort of communication that we could communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| to one source where we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| very serious need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| at that time, not wait a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| week or so but how we could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| back to them and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| the wide area, I'm not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| smaller disasters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| disasters are disasters but if you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| something like that here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Camp, how would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| react and what would be our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| and that's the only thing I wanted to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| about on that part and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| later on if we needed to take a discussion or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| learning how we deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| with disasters and how we clean up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| and how we decide which houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| we mark and make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| they're safe, there's nobody in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| houses, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| way back in the country and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Mr. Beeler I know you have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| and I know Carson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| has some way out in his area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| and why I say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| is strange thing, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| this deal that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| weekends, Sunday afternoon drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| I take my wife down all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| back roads and find out some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| people that live in there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| she's getting tired and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| to be retiring in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| so but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| you just know people need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| help and how do we get to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and that was what I wanted to bring that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| now can I make one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| I want to talk about decorum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| when commissioners are out in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| Chairman Beeler you don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| close you were to being a mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| ago when we were dedicating two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| fire trucks and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| mayor was standing in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| of a fire truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| and for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| reason he pressed, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| David pressed a horn and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| it's funny to turn around and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| because I was standing to the side and turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| and look at a mayor going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| he went up about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| 36 inches straight up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3224)|

| 1:03:08| downtown or something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| but you're talking way out in the country where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| you need some information where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| you might be able to save a life or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| if we get that quick response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| that may be under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| debris and things of that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| but we need to know how to get there safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| we need to know how to respond back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| to you where to respond back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| and not overwhelm you on 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| I would say that even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| if it's a life threatening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| or even potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| life threatening or we're not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| 911 putting that information into 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| is the best way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| get it into the system and find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| the response agencies that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| jurisdiction we also see that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| that's one of the very first things we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| in the emergency operations center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| so that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| carefully crafted pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| that's frankly very efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| 911 folks do a great job of that that's the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| way to give us the information is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| what you're asking? Yeah and the other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| here too I'll give you this example too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| there are some roads that I get on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| that has one sign that says this is the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| if the sign wasn't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| I would not know that that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| but I know there's people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| in there so I could go down through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| and if I call you and say this is where you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| go to if you're sending a response person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| they could miss that road two or three different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| times before they make the right turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| and I'm saying what do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| to do to make sure that we get it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| and not waste the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| emergency's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| and I'm getting on to stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| right here that will probably never happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| but we should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| responsible because the people in Kentucky never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| were ready for what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| happened in that one town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| that's all I was bringing up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| and I just want to know that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| said well here's what you need to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| here's how you need to stay safe out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| and here's if it does happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| and you're in that outlying area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| outlying area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| help us get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| if there is a life threatening situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| and how can we tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| and that's some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| some of your GPS will not get you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| where you need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| so anyway that's all I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| and maybe a response for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| since we know our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| that we can get to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| this communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Commissioner Daly your light's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Colin good to see you again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| the absolutely best committee that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Noss County's got is called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3938)|

| 1:05:44| started this a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| I hear some of this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| because I'm there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I hear what's going on behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| that we don't know what's going on behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| we're getting upgrades in our E911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| system where if one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| fails we've got backup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| it's amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| when I first started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| we first started this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| one department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| or one service was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| envy of the other service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| now they're meshing together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| they're coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| as one and I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| if we did and God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| I hope we never have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| that type of disaster here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| but with our fire departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| and working with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| working with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| I think we were in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| fairly good spot at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| it's a huge picture Commissioner Buster's correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| you know I got people up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Seven Islands that when a tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4000)|

| 1:06:44| in an ice storm it may be weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| before they can get power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| or get out of there so I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| what the Commissioner's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| but we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| getting there slowly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| and I can see that going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| at the committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4020)|

| 1:07:10| you don't have to be a member of that just check on your neighbor anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4030)|

| 1:07:14| this because it's just because but I've been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| for 60 years I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4036)|

| 1:07:24| we know each other and that's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| of what we've got to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| I know Commissioner Buster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| gets them all done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| the storm comes and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| get a phone call they'll say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Commissioner Tree's down here or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220118?start=4056)|
