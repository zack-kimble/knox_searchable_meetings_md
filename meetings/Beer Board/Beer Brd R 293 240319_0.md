| 0:13:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| We'll move on to the addendum items now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| Our first one is 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Cheesemosa, cocktails, and comida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Emmanuel Limon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Chair, they have actually picked up their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Oh, that is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| You did mark that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| We'll move on then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| That was just to test my pronunciation skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| 7B, dash and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Tamalyn Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Anyone from dash and go here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| Tamalyn Harper, 2128 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Sergeant Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Okay, because these are addendum items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| So, Mr. Burr, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| We're outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| We're just waiting on the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Ms. Harper, what's the status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| What are the updates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| So, the updates is it took me a while to get someone to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| to draw up the plans for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| They ended up being a huge bill that I wasn't expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| So, it took a while to find someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| We found someone last week that can kind of help us out and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| the plans drawn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| So, we submitted the information to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| It took me, it was going to take us somewhere between 10 and 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| days for him to get the information back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| So, I am working on it, trying to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| It's just, like I say, it was an unexpected expense, huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| So, someone was supposed to call me from the last time I was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| to help me, but I could never get in touch with anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| but this is where I am on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| So, I'm still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| I'm trying to remember because, sorry, I can't remember if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| spoke to you or if somebody else spoke to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| maybe Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Do you remember who spoke to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| I think it was you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| You think it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| So, right now, you've turned in plans to the building department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| or you're waiting on the person who drew the plans to get them to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| So, what happened was they, once I went up to the permit office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| for the plans, they told me to write the plans up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| I got someone to do that, and then they ended up telling me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| it was the wrong thing that I had as far as the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| and they couldn't accept those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| So, once it began with the building being an overall overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| or outlook of the entire building instead of the part that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| store is occupying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| So, partially, the store is only occupying a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| Well, now they want a whole outlook of the entire building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| So, like I said, this became an expense I didn't expect to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| for the store to carry beer, but this is where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I've been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Like I said, it took a little minute to get this going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| but we did find someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| The rest of the beer board, the history of this is they were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| pending final documentation July 25th, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| We gave an extension on November 28th, 2023, and so here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| And I don't know if anybody wants to ask some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| or make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| My light's not working, so that's convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| What I was going to ask is how much time do you feel that you'll need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| to get everything completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Typically, we'll do a 90-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| and you can always turn everything in early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| so you don't have to wait the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| So, if you get it done sooner, but do you feel like you've got 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| would get you where you need to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Now that, like I say, the cost is not so much of an issue anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| once I found out the information that it took to get someone to draw up the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| and architect, that was, like I say, a huge expense I never expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| With a lot of things that was going on with the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| it's maintenance, just routine normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Like I say, this was just an unexpected cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| So now that we have someone, yes, I think it will be done before the 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| but the 90 days would be great just to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Well, I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| and I also just wanted to point out, just like the Chair mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| you had been approved pending file documentation in July of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| So if we get too close to that July date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| a typical policy for Beer Board would have you go through the background check again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| and so just if you get close to that July date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| just remember that when you come back you're probably going to get asked if you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Council Member Roberto, could I get you to revise your motion to June instead of 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Yeah, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I have a problem with saying the number of days instead of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| so I'm going to say June to make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| So I'll give you until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Will that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Okay, I've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Ms. Harper, I'm asking someone from the building department to give you a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Our next agenda item is 7C, Fast Hand Tavern, Kevin Hibbs, Amber Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1128)|
| 0:18:58| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Kevin Hibbs, 3800 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Mr. Hibbs, would you like to give us an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| We have an issue with an investor that kind of put us at a holding pattern for a couple months there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| We just got that figured out, so we should be making some major steps very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| So the history is you were approved September 20, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| and then we had you visit us again for an extension January 24, 2023, May 16, 2023, August, September, and January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1167)|
| 0:19:42| So were you in a hold during a lot of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Not for the whole time, but we ran into some unexpected plumbing issues that came up to a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| Mr. Byrd, what are we outstanding on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Just the certificate of occupancy for the inspections approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| FIRE is approved already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| The last meeting we had, you guys were noticed to be here, and you weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| That is troublesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| I missed that email, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| That was unintentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| And you ended up in good shape because that was the same day we had the snow, so I said it's possible that you couldn't leave your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1223)|
| 0:20:32| so I'll give you an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| I would have walked if I had to, but I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So one of the things that I'm concerned with here, too, is the history that the Chair just went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| This has been going on for a long time, and I understand that, you know, you can run into unexpected things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| That happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| It has been, I think, more than a year since you've done a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| Yeah, and I'm willing to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| I'll go through that whole process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| So I'm willing to give you an extension if you'll go through the background check again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| Do you feel like you could get this done by June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| I would like to think so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| And, of course, if I give you until June, then you can always come in early, and when you're done, get it all turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Come in tomorrow, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| We'd love to see you, but I'm sure you've got better things to do with your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| So, yeah, we'll go ahead and extend until June since they're going to do their background check again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| Sergeant Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| You'll also need to take the CAST class again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| So to Councilman Roberto's point, when you come and take that class, you can do the background the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Councilman Roberto, did I hear a formal motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| I move to give them until June, so extend to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| And now I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I feel like I've turned away from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1317)|

| 0:22:30| I'm waiting on my driveway permit from the TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| They were going through a transition period, so it got delayed, and now they are starting to respond again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1354)|
| 0:22:41| So my engineer has been submitting them the plans to fix our driveway, and once they approve it, we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1361)|
| 0:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1369)|

| 0:23:00| We just need the certificate of occupancy and then approval from the Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1385)|

| 0:23:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1392)|

| 0:23:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Mr. Ramji, you've made a lot of progress, and so you only lack a little bit of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Do you think you can have it done in 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1421)|

| 0:24:07| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1447)|

| 0:25:41| so I expected that she would be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1541)|

| 0:26:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| So your beer permit was first approved May 16, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| and then we had a couple of extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| So can you give us an update of where things are for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1592)|

| 0:26:39| submit it to the office, to the city office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| and so we're just waiting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| So you don't have approved plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| You've got to turn drawings in to get approved plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| We've gone through, like, the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| and we've submitted papers and drawings and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| So they reviewed it, and they gave us comments and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| but they've told us that we need to get an architect to do us another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| So you're resubmitting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| So you do not have a permit for the work that needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Not yet, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| I'm just trying to figure out where you were in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| So, Mr. Byrd, your notes are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| We would just need the certificate of occupancy, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and then the health department approval would typically follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| What all build out do you need to do once you get your permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| What building modifications do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| It's really simple stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| They are asking for a, like, a gated, wooded gated around the trash bin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Some plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| It's really simple stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| So after we get approved for us to start working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| it shouldn't be about two to three weeks to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| So not a full build out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Yeah, it's not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Sergeant Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| He is still good on my end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| The cast has not expired yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| How much longer does he have on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I should have wrote that down, but he had until the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| I forget what specific date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Yeah, it looks like you've been really busy in getting things in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| and just need a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Would it help you to say maybe June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| I'll extend the permit to June, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| You have an extension until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Hopefully you can wrap up by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| And not come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Next on the agenda is 7-I, Tobacco Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Gunvantre Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| Is there anyone here from Tobacco Shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| 700 Merchants Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1743)|
| 0:29:11| I did see Mr. Patel last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| You did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| But I can't pick him out of the crowd here today, so I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| This is the best attended beer board I've ever seen in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| It's hard to see people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| I'll come back and do one more roll call through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| So let's move on to 7-J, Yeehaw Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Jesse Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Charles Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I'm not sure who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Andrew Hale from the Cranberry Racing Law Firm on behalf of Yeehaw Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Oh, and Mr. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Just popped up out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Would you gentlemen like to give us an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Real quickly, just for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| The beer permit was originally approved June 27, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| We've had a few extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| So where are we at now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| So we've been working very closely with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| We believe we've identified the correct solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| I've filed for a parking variance with the BZA last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| It should be on the April agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| And so I would think that if that goes as planned, that should be resolved by next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1833)|
| 0:30:42| However, if we deem it prudent, we would request an extension of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| If 90 days is deemed appropriate by the beer board, then that would be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| However, it should be resolved next week is our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Or next month, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Can you refresh my memory exactly what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Because I was at Yeehaw last night, so I know you're functioning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| What are we adding or changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| So there is two spaces on the other side of Irwin Street, 130 and 134 Bearden Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| that there will be retail sales out of those premises, as well as the storing of inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1876)|
| 0:31:24| Originally, it was going to be used as just inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| That is not permitted under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| So therefore, it will be used as a retail space, which is permitted under the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| However, there are parking requirements under the CG2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1899)|
| 0:31:45| And based on the configuration of this property, there is no parking available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| We originally thought what could happen is we could enter into a shared parking agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| with the Yeehaw space off-Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| However, accessible parking is not able to be shared under a shared parking agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| So what we identified with zoning is to request a parking variance from the parking requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1930)|
| 0:32:19| under the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| So this is expanding the footprint from, like, Yeehaw that's open right now has a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| These are separate addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| And expanding the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I know we've heard about this one a couple of times, but it's a refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1958)|

| 0:32:40| Does anybody have any questions, want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1962)|

| 0:32:56| But if things don't work out the way you hope next week, it will give you a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| I think we should move it to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Is that three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=1988)|

| 0:33:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2003)|

| 0:34:12| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| One of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2053)|

| 0:34:21| Take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Well, I'm trying to find my notes, but Mr. Kumar, Robbie, one of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| owners, has a current outstanding charge for sale of alcohol to a minor that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| not been disposed of yet in Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| I think he already did all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| He took the classes, and I think he paid all the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Currently in our gym system, he's got a court date scheduled for the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| I think it's April 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I defer to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| This pertains to Robbie Kumar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| There are a number of Kumars here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| Well, on the application, sir, he failed to disclose that he had any charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| currently pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| That's a basis for denial of granting a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| If he is convicted of a beer permit, Section 4-37 of the code, he would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| ineligible, and he would lose a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| As you all have applied, it can be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| He came on the board later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| He was the original owner at first, but then now he's putting money in as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| need more owners, so I didn't know what was going on with that, but we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| discuss, and I can do whatever you guys ask me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| He's listed, I believe, as a 15% owner, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Like I said, 4-37, if he's convicted, he's not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| His failure to disclose, he signed under oath that everything was truthful and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2170)|
| 0:36:18| factually correct, and that's a flaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| So, Mr. Kumar, I'm going to reiterate what I think Mr. Farrar said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| The way that the application has been made, that our only option is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| So, I believe, Mr. Frost, correct me if my understanding is correct, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| need to withdraw this, it was one of their options to withdraw this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| and reapply with a different ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Yes, that's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| They can withdraw the application and then come back anew with a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| So, he can't be on the board, he can't be as an owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Well, he failed to disclose charges currently pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| That is a basis to deny the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Even if he had disclosed the sale to an underage person, if he was convicted of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| it, he was ineligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Sorry, Chair, I don't think any of the lights are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Is it me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| It's not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Would I have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Mr. Frost, is it possible to withdraw the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| What impact does that have on reapplying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| They'll just start anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| So, I'm not comfortable at all approving this because of the failure to disclose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| but then the not disclosing it, a known issue, and signing off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| So, my recommendation would be that you withdraw and you come back with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| different application, but that's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| So, if that's what you'd like to do and withdraw, then I think now is the time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Otherwise, we'll move forward with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| I mean, I think that would be the best option we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| So, what I'm getting from you is that you want to withdraw the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| And then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Does anybody else want to wave their hands to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| Because I can't see a light, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| I just wanted to clarify if the 15% owner is not found guilty in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| He then can be a part of the next application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| We just need to make sure everyone is accurately depicting, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| accurately answering the questions in that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Was that clear to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| But I wasn't even sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| And he properly fills out his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| As long as the 15% owner is not found guilty in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| he can be a part of the next application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| as long as he fills it out truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| And his court date is on April 25th, you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2370)|

| 0:39:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| April 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2376)|

| 0:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| So if you wanted to reapply prior to the April 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| then you would have to reconstitute your ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2384)|

| 0:39:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| So for now we can just withdraw, I think, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| And then apply based on whatever the decision they make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2401)|

| 0:40:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| But if we want to wait until April 25th, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240319?start=2408)|
