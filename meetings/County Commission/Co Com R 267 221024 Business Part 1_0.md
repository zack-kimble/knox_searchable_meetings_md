| 0:01:27| weighed on my heart. Any chance I have to talk about my granddaughter, Savannah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| Rose, I'm gonna do it. We took her to Gatlinburg for the weekend. Savannah is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| three and a half and she knows no stranger. Her first question to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=97)|

| 0:02:20| the betterment and their protection. I think it's always best to remember, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=140)|

| 0:26:09| but rather the low expectations by the general public that is their greatest barrier to fulfillment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| And whereas both the Tennessee Council of the Blind and the National Federation of the Blind of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1575)|

| 0:28:01| why do the blind need to advance more awareness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| Don't we see blind people on TV?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1688)|

| 0:29:27| I would like to see blindness included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1767)|

| 0:29:37| in not just Knox County, but all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1777)|

| 0:29:59| and I taught them how to walk side-to-guide with someone in handcuffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| cuffed in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1805)|

| 0:30:34| They let someone walk on their gun side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| And I was telling the security guard earlier when I came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| he winded me and took my stuff away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And I came through here a few years ago, and the guy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| oh, you can go on through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| You can go on through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| And then I said, look, you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| He said, but you look trustworthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| That tells me that we just do not have enough awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| As long as people will speak to someone with a blind person or any disabled person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| instead of them, that's a lack of courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| And also, that's a lack of just don't know thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| Now, I had someone, I asked them, can I follow you to the pump machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| They said, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| I said, okay, let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| And they reached down and picked up the end of my cane and started pulling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| That tells me we have a lack of awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| And that's something that I fully intend to change in the coming months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| and the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Public works people, I'm glad you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| because I'm going to be in touch with y'all too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| At one of our buildings in Knoxville, there is a Braille sign that is above my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| Legally, it only cannot be any higher than 48 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| Somebody apparently didn't know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| So this is another thing that I'm going to be working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| And, again, it's a lack of awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| And it does kind of come down to thoughtlessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| Because they put the Braille sign up there, they weren't thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| And this is, again, something that I hope having the Blind Equality and Achievement Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:21| and knowing that our county commission has paid attention and is doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| is going to give me more leverage to continue to do what I've been doing in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| And I've got some cards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=1955)|

| 0:47:04| Mr. Odom, I was reading the report you sent out to us late last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| where it seems there are more – the unemployment rate is down, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| But the labor force continues to sort of shrink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| So is it fair to say there are more than ample enough jobs for anyone that wants a job in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| As I've said here before, we still have more jobs than we have people to fill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| So are there any efforts that the Chamber is working on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| I mean, how do we – is it about growing your own labor pool here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| or is the trend finding advertising, marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| or engaging people from outside the metro area and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| come here because there are jobs like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| You can't just magically make people go to work tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| So we are attacking it in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| So one, locally what we're trying to do is really align the skills of those people who aren't working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| or who have jobs that are maybe below what they really can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| We just don't have the right skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| So we're trying to fix that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| And two, for about a year now, we have been out of market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| marketing the jobs that we have, marketing the type of community we are to try to recruit people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| We started mainly with former residents, mainly UT graduates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| and now we're starting to broad it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| So we've been in markets like Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=2915)|

| 1:00:05| I can honestly say that I've never heard a more preposterous idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3605)|

| 1:00:13| but this one takes the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| The very notion of adding 500 homes and an estimated 800 vehicles to an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| and instead of improving existing roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| we think the solution is to close roads is absolutely absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| We're proposing routing all existing traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| as well as all new traffic through Thompson School Road to Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| and then into the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| It takes my buses that currently travel that direction on average until 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3635)|

| 1:00:44| Then we're going to add all the other traffic and have a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| We're not improving anything by doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| only making things more difficult in another area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| simply moving the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| There are three schools located in this particular school zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| many people traveling from Luttrell, Washburn, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| use Carnes Road to avoid the school zone traffic and headache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| and I, for one, appreciate everyone who does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| We have enough problems with traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| so all that can avoid the area are extremely helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| I have two large buses that, due to routing, must travel Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| One of those must travel Lett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| and trust me when I tell you that Lett Road is no place for a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| This would cause both buses to travel Lett Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| or be forced to turn around, which, by the way, is illegal in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| for a bus to turn around unless there's no other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| I understand that it's a lot of money to improve Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| However, if we're going to continue to allow more residential construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| then we simply have to improve the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Closing it is ludicrous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Of the estimated 800 vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| the majority of them will be going towards Knoxville anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| so the 800-vehicle number appears to me as a scare tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| Yes, there will be increased traffic on Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| Yes, Carnes Road needs tremendous improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| Perhaps we should have considered this before we expanded the residential size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| However, apparently these subdivisions are approved and on their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| and it's the same everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| This is not a problem that only Gibbs is dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| It's nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| I can only hope that someone with some common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| thinks this through in how to accommodate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| We're about to turn Tazewell Pike and Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| into an absolute parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| with basically one way in and one way out of the school zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| and no way to avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| See how ridiculous this sounds to even say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Just a couple of weeks ago, we had a semi-accident on Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| that closed it down completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Can you imagine if Carnes Road hadn't been an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Please think ahead and think of other areas affected by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| as well as how this will affect bus service and tardies at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Money now up front to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| is going to save unbelievable amounts of money in lost salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| wasted fuel, and idle traffic jams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| and future improvements in Tazewell Pike, Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| and Thompson School Road areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| The new intersection at Emory and Thompson School is nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| but not adequate to handle what is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Tony Roberts, if you're here, will you please approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| and you will have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| Tony Roberts, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| I'm here to talk about the closure of Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| It was brought up because of safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| and I think the closure of the road doesn't address the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| It's actually on the end that's the safest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| so they're proposing to close the safe end of Carnes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| and people will still travel from that cul-de-sac to Thompson School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| and have side swaps or being veered off the road by other drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| So I don't think it addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Another thing that it does is causes issues in other intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| It's going to force people, Barker Road to Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and there's new developments north of Tazewell Pike of Barker Road there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| that it's going to be more traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| and we're putting people in the school zone queue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| that don't have drop-offs or pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| So it's going to back up, and we're going to have trouble pulling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| onto Tazewell Pike from Barker Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| And the speed limit now is 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| I feel like if we close Carnes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| nobody's going to be looking for anybody to pull out on Barker Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| so we're going to drive even faster than 25 down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| So I think we're going to cause more safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| and not address the real safety issues that are on Carnes if we do the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| I'm looking forward to a community meeting we're having in three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| and I appreciate Commissioner Beeler and Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| for getting us together at the middle school to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| So hopefully we can come up with other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3900)|

| 1:05:15| My name is Ronald Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3915)|

| 1:05:20| I'm here in opposition to the Carnes proposal, the Carnes Road closure also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| As stated, the closure of the road basically is going to do a great injustice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| to a lot of different people, to accommodate a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| If you build a cul-de-sac on Carnes Road, then there's a subdivision, country roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| and there's also the folks that live on Lett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| A lot of those people will actually turn and come out Lett Road to Barker Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| to access Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| If you put a cul-de-sac there, then you're going to put everybody out to the same exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| off Carnes Road onto Thompson School Road, which, as has been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| with Thompson School Road and all the multiple subdivisions that are being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| which I have no problem with, you're going to have a lot of obstruction there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| trying to getting out of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| The one thing that I have not heard is that if you build a cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| the area that we live in, although it's growing greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| it's still a very agricultural rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| There are a tremendous number of farmers that use Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| That's the only road that we have that will give us a viaduct between Tassel Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| and Emory Road and stay off the state roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| A lot of the different farmers use the secondary roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| and they crisscross to where they have minimal access onto the state roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| If you put a cul-de-sac on Carnes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| then that means you're going to have all the traffic from the tractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| and the bailing equipment and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| which most of the tractors are built to run about a maximum of 18 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| You're going to put them right in all the traffic at the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| and all the traffic at the red light at the junction of Emory Road and Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| That's a very unsafe situation for all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Also, we have some neighbors that live on Barker Road that have family that live on Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| If they want to visit their grandchildren, their children, their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| then instead of being able to drive 200 yards down Carnes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| then they're going to have to drive all the way out to Tassel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| Emory Road, back in on Thompson School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| so a 200-yard drive becomes about a four-mile drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| Also, there's another gentleman that's in attendance that's one of the farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| He lives less than 200 yards from Carnes Road on Barker Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| He has a farm leased with cattle on Lett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| He also bales a number of fields that are on Carnes Road for hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| That means for him to check his cattle, he's got to drive the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| He's got to drive, instead of a half a mile, he's got to drive four miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| If he's using his tractor equipment, then he's got to drive out on the state roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| go down Tassel Pike, down Emory Road, back up Thompson School Road and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| It's creating a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| I know that the road is narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| The road is curvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| But honestly, if you look at the other roads in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| as far as Barker Road, Irwin Road, Woods Road, they're all narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| Barker Road, we had a request for lines in the middle of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| and we were told that the road was too narrow to put lines on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| Secondly, Carnes Road has one curve, an S curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| If you drive down any of the other roads, they have multiple curves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| and part of them are blind curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| So this is an unsafe situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| It's an injustice to the citizens there on all the adjoining roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| Barker Road, Thompson School Road, Woods Road, Irwin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| So I would hope that you all would look at this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| and vote no to the closure of Carnes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Thank you for the time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| Ms. Katelyn Jones, if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| You are our last speaker for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| State your name and county of residence for the record, and you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| Hi, my name is Katelyn Jones, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Something that I just wanted to bring to everyone's attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| that I think a lot of people often forget is accountability amongst public officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| but not only public officials, but also people who serve the public in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| I have a very, very good friend whose daughter is a 12-year-old at Cedar Bluff Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| She has been trying to get the school to agree to a transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| because her 12-year-old daughter, who has medical issues, is being denied that transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| even though she is being bullied relentlessly by people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| and is now talking about committing suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| And that's not fair to her as a mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| She shouldn't have to fight this hard for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| I understand that you guys can't do much about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| but I do think that it's a problem in Knox County as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| and sometimes I think that there are people who forget that they need to do what's best for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| I do urge all of you to make sure to do everything you can to fix situations like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| not only for kids in Knox County schools, but also kids and people of Knox County in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| I think that a lot of people forget what they're supposed to be doing when they do serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Something else I just wanted to bring up is that I come to a lot of county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| I come to a lot of school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| It seems to be that there are a lot of petty grievances that are brought into these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| especially amongst other people on the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| and I want to remind everyone that, oh, I understand your job is hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| and I understand that it's not easy to run for a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| You are here to serve the people of Knox County, and it doesn't seem like that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| It seems very clicky up here, and it's very hard to watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| and it's very frustrating as a constituent of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| when it continues to happen month after month on the same agenda items month after month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| and it gets very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| So I just wanted to remind everyone that it is a very, very important job you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| and I do understand it's not an easy job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| and I understand that it's something that you've done because you've called to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| I just hope that you remember why you're here and why you chose to do this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| and you don't use your own personal grievances against other people as a public official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| and not serving the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| And again, I do hope that you all are able to work with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| in figuring out how to stop the bullying, which is causing mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| and I do also agree that we need a mental health hospital here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| So if you guys have any questions, I will be here after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Thank you, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| That concludes our public forum for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4357)|

| 1:12:45| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4366)|

| 1:14:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| I had asked Director Snowden to compile some information for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| I think it's important that this body take into consideration that every month when we do accept new roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| the number of miles of roads we're adding to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| the cost to construct those roads and then also to maintain those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| So, Director Snowden, if you'll just share some of that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| We'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| I'd be glad to, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Yeah, we had looked, and obviously the price of asphalt is at an all-time high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| It's higher now than it has ever been, so that kind of compounds this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| But I put together just some factoids here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| All our subdivision streets are 26-foot wide with curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| and obviously a curb street requires milling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| So you have to essentially take off the one layer of asphalt to put the other down to maintain the reveal at the same height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| to maintain drainage like the constituents would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| So that cost includes milling and asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| So a mile to pave, one mile of the 26-foot wide subdivision street, including milling, is about $220,000 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:24| Last year that price was somewhere around $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| The cost to repave a 18-foot wide road, which doesn't require the milling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| it does require us to add some shoulder stone and build up the shoulders and instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| that's about $125,000 a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| To give you a perspective, essentially to pave a roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| we usually put two inches of uncompacted asphalt on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| It compacts about a quarter inch per inch, so that comes down to about an inch and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| which is kind of what we like to see on a roadway that's in decent condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| That's 1,525 tons of asphalt per mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| If we do have to do a full-depth reclamation, which is to actually remove all the underlying base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| which we typically don't have to do because hopefully my staff, if they're doing a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| and maintaining the roads and making sure that there's not major cracking going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| and we prioritize the paving correctly, we don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| But that works out to about $50,000 to $75,000 a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| So hopefully those things aren't necessarily – we don't have that often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| but from time to time we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| One of the things else I looked at was over the past 25 years of my career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| we've averaged about nine miles of road accepted per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| So this body accepts about nine miles of new county road per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| which is primarily 26-foot-wide subdivision streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| One of the things that we're doing as part of Advance Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| is trying to look at that and figure out – our fiscal consultant is looking at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:05| for us to better manage that expense, which is to create town and country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| and or on-the-road-again scenarios that limit our continued sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| and allow for less of these roadways like this with higher density and maybe even narrower streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| So there are some things we're doing with that that will hopefully assist in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| One of the other things we do or have done over the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| is implemented a pavement management system, which I've talked to a lot of you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| We assign a numerical score per every road so we have a better idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| and we evaluate that score every third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| So we think that that will – that in combination with Advance Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| will allow us to be better stewards of the roadway network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| But to Commissioner Fraser's point, it is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| It's more expensive now than it ever has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| So it's very important that we be good stewards of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| and manage this roadway system as efficiently as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| So with that, I'll be happy to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| Jim, when we accept these roads in the subdivision, what's the lifespan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| Typically, we would look upon at least before we have to do resurfacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| a 20-year time frame is a reasonable – I mean, if it's – we've got good inspection staff now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| and we do pretty good testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| So I would think 20 years would be the first time that we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| any kind of substantial maintenance, Commissioner Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Yeah, I've heard 20, 25 years, which is really – for a subdivision, that's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| And it's not like a regular road is maybe paid every five years or six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| according to heavy traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| Yeah, I mean, if you're – and obviously it does – volume of traffic is the biggest component of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| But we pay – Cedar Bluffs is one of our busier roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| and we paved it probably about 10 or 12 years ago, and it's coming on needing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| So, I mean, I think we can reasonably get about 15 years out of a major roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| that's carrying, you know, in that 10,000 to 15,000 cars a day range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| I'm sure you get this question a lot, and I get it when I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| And I tell people, when a developer goes in to develop, they've got to develop that road to specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:39| The utilities are put in by the developer, not by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| All this is done by the developer, and we take it – well, the utility will take it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| whichever utility it is, and then we take over the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| So, no taxpayer money is used for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| So, it's a pretty good deal, really, if you talk 20, 25 years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| before you'd have to have a resurfacing on a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Mr. Snowden, how many total county miles of roads do we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| and then do you break that down by residential and, like you said, Cedar Bluff, those kind of roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:27| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| We have – and we have – this is centerline miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| We have more than this if you add lane miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Like, you know, Cedar Bluff will have five lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| But centerline miles, we have 1,730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| So, our network – I think if you add in lane miles, it's a little over something like 2,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:49| Probably – I don't know the exact number of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I can get that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| But probably two-thirds are residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| So, a large percentage of that 1,700 is 26-foot-wide residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| And on the 12 roads that we're accepting tonight in one subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| would a member of your team actually been there on site and watched all of those roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| or would they have just watched two or three roads and figured the rest were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| No, we're on site any time subgrades prepared because that's where usually –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| if you can't get the – if you don't get the dirt work right, it gets off from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| So, we're there every time the earth is prepared as well as the stone and the asphalt goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| and curbing, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And in those streets, what the policy or the procedure is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| is once we have identified that there's no deficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| oftentimes in this case I think they did have some deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| They had to go back and repair before we will release or agree to release their surety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| And then once they have met all that punch list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| then that acceptance comes to this body for acceptance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| and then we release the surety upon acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Are there any more questions for Director Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| Thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=4931)|

| 1:39:21| First, I want to say thank you to all my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| for signing on to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5963)|

| 1:39:29| I'm very excited about the amount of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| I've heard over the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| I don't want this to be hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And by saying that, I mean I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| to make sure that there's action past this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| So Chairwoman, I'd like to maybe need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| to bring a resolution next month or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| But I'd like to make an action committee tackling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| And I think the structure going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| we really need to look into where we're going to put this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| how it's going to be designed, how much is it going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| and if we can get to 10% or 20% from the county and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| the city to send this to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| and say, hey, we have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| We know how much it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| We're willing to put a little bit in to help out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| But I'd like to at least explore those options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| and try to see what's going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| So I'm going to talk to the law director after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| and figure out what the best way of going and doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| But that's kind of my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| I'd also like to ask if we can send a copy of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| to the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| And I will try to reach out to the city council people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| and see if they would also like to help support this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| and hopefully bring a resolution of their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| and maybe even partner with us in trying to solve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:46| Because this isn't just a county issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| It's a city issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| It's a people issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| This isn't partisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Like you so beautifully said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| this is not a partisan topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| This is really a people topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| So that's kind of my plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| Just letting everybody know, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6060)|

| 1:41:10| to help our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6070)|

| 1:41:38| well, many of them here, as well as our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| we spearheaded the annual state of mental health first report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:45| That has been more formalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| And a lot of robust work has been put into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| or will be presented to us this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| at our Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| I think that's an important piece of the puzzle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| to understand what we have, what we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| I agree with Ms. Scheib on so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6121)|

| 1:42:13| And I don't discount Director Buch last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| You were here long before I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| And probably will be here long after I'm gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6138)|

| 1:42:22| I wasn't here during that time when Lakeshore closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6142)|

| 1:42:28| I take all that for face value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| There's a little bit of language in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| It's fine to go through tonight, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| But it sort of calls out the state for not doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| that I'm not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6160)|

| 1:43:56| but open arms and an appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221024-business-part-1?start=6236)|
