| 2:50:16| I hope they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| I always say we don't care who does it as long as somebody does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| So we need for some action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| The roof is a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| There are structural issues that are spreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| We don't think that that roof structure will make it through another winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| and we need to calculate the process for any option that we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| as to how far out that actually puts the stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| I know we have at least two people who are interested in stabilizing the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| and giving it a second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10241)|
| 2:50:42| And with all the recent publicity and color photos in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10242)|
| 2:50:46| I'm sure that we'll have some more interest stirred up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| And as we all know, waterfront development is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| The city is actively engaged in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| And waterfront redevelopment means reinvestment is coming to this part of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10255)|
| 2:51:00| And the question for you today is whether or not South High will be there to greet it when it does arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10260)|
| 2:51:06| So I hope that you will give that building one more chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| and help bring in a private developer to help stabilize the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:13| Mr. Trent, if your wish was granted and there was a buyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10273)|
| 2:51:19| and the buyer, we were able to go through the process, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10279)|
| 2:51:22| what would you foresee or what would you think would be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10282)|
| 2:51:27| to make this a properly functioning rehabilitation project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10287)|
| 2:51:32| Would you put stipulations on time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| And if you did, what and how and that type of structure to the agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10295)|
| 2:51:42| I definitely would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10302)|
| 2:51:43| I mean, you'd have to ask Hugh Holt, you know, what can be included in each option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10303)|
| 2:51:47| But I think there should be a timeline for, you know, a new roof, securing the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:52| dealing with the structural issues, just keeping it tight and keeping the water out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| I mean, if we had done that in the history of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| we wouldn't be standing here right now with the urgency that we are facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| I mean, if you keep the water out, keep the vandals out, it's like mothballing a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| And then more options are open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| Development may not occur right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| And then other options have time to come into play that once it's gone, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10332)|
| 2:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| The gentleman sitting down in the front, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| I think he wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10343)|
| 2:52:26| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10348)|
| 2:52:29| My name is Duke Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| I live at 1616 Treetop Ridge Lane in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| in West Knoxville, just off North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| But I just simply saw the articles in the paper and saw Mr. Pinkston's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10358)|
| 2:52:43| and also Mr. Holt's comments, and I visited both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| In the last few days, Mr. Pinkston, in fact, is home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| He wouldn't have expected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| Had he been expecting me, he probably wouldn't have let me come over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| But I'm simply a nut on saving antiquity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| There's two folks right here in your audience today, Ms. Lillian Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10377)|
| 2:53:03| and Mr. Bruce Williams, who had a home who's part of the National Register of Historical Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:12| I've got a home safe for them out there north of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:19| There's a nice family living there right now today that really took it on themselves to restore it to, like all get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10399)|
| 2:53:28| But besides being a nut on saving antiquity from a practical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10408)|
| 2:53:34| it costs too much daggone money to rip that place out and haul it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10414)|
| 2:53:39| It'll be a small price if you got it hauled off for $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10419)|
| 2:53:44| Besides that, Mr. Pinkston brought out a good comment the other day when I was talking with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| Not only that, if you did rip it out and haul it off, what would be left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| What's there now is what creates a value to the property that's there in existence right now at this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10432)|
| 2:53:58| Don't you agree with me, Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| And so why not save this thing, develop it into condos or some such good use for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10440)|
| 2:54:10| And, of course, one other dog in the fight I'd like to state, of course, I'd love the position of being able to auction it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10450)|
| 2:54:19| I think we'd get it to the highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| I think we'd save the town the most money and develop the most for everything all concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10461)|
| 2:54:28| But that to the side, I just want to voice that it's crazy in my estimation to rip it out, haul it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10468)|
| 2:54:39| It's too much money, too much waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| It's idiotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10482)|
| 2:54:44| And I'll leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| I'd like a position with it to help, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| And I appreciate you allowing me to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Is there anybody here from Parks and Recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10498)|
| 2:55:05| Is Doug here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| He's trying to hide over in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10509)|
| 2:55:14| Doug, we're sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| We're trying to decide, you know, what to do, keep it, restore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| You know, if we tear it down, if we tear it down, there's a possibility of a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| Do we have a park close by there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| I mean, is something, in your opinion, is a park needed in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10524)|
| 2:55:29| Honestly, I would probably defer to the city because especially this size of 2.2 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| we typically try not to look at small parks like that in the county system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| It would fit more into the city system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| So I don't know if there's a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| It would definitely just be a neighborhood park that would serve neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| and walking distance primarily at that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| Is it big enough to put, I mean, you've got some parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| Is it big enough to put a little soccer field in for little kids, or is it too small?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| It's very marginal for a soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| It would probably be more like a playground, picnic shelter, and that would be about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| Doug, could I comment on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| We've got Sam Duff Park there that's probably less than a mile from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| We've got the soccer fields right there at the highest, I mean, at the Dogwood Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| We've got, you know, we've got several parks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| Another thing I would like to say, I've been talking to Alex Schubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| We're trying to get about 200 acres out there from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| And I've been talking to him about maybe it'll reduce price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| and a tax credit in this property over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| There's some talk of maybe this being an assisted living thing put in there in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:35| And I sort of like what you said, if they've got the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| The county does not have the money to go in and do this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| or we would have sold it a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| Now, the $25,000 that Ms. Trent's talking about, the reason that people walked away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10604)|
| 2:56:49| we have a parking problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| The city won't get parking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| The school board will not get parking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| They cannot do any grade work in the front like Commissioner Lambert's talking about those trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| So that's the problem we have with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| It's not that we haven't tried to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:06| Knox County has only had it since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10626)|
| 2:57:09| And I believe Mr. Holt will go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| And we've had how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10631)|
| 2:57:12| Four proposals on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| And every one of them have been turned down because of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| The reason why I say we should auction this property off is after this person buys it, let them worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10637)|
| 2:57:22| Now, Ms. Trent says that we can get this money from this historical preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10642)|
| 2:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| Now, let the city step up to the pump on their teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| We're going to give this property a big reduced price if it goes to public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| So let them step up and then step up to the pump to give parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10658)|
| 2:57:43| That's been our hold back all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| Now, the school, there's talk that they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| They were going to tear this property down in about 1997, I believe, somewhere along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10668)|
| 2:57:55| When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| And the people there had an uprising about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| Not so much about tearing the building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| It was they did not want a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| Now, I have not had a lot of e-mails on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| And to be honest with you, the last election that I had run for, I had five signs on the street right beside it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10690)|
| 2:58:17| which consists of maybe 15 or 20 houses, and I had three on the street in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:23| So there's not that big of an uprising, but I'm preserving this building if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| But we need to get rid of it somewhere or other and let somebody else have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| Now, we have the right to turn down what it brings back on auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| If it doesn't bring what we think is right, we can turn that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| Plus, we have a deal here that we need to proceed with working just in case we don't get enough money for this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:48| which I don't care what it brings a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| If it's a public auction, if it brings a dollar, that's the high bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| But we have that working, and I have a deal working with Alex Hubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| So let's proceed with this auction and still work on these other deals, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10737)|
| 2:59:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| Is anybody here from Public Billing Authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| Is that who's over this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10752)|
| 2:59:17| Who's in charge of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Knox Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| Is it Public Billing Authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10762)|
| 2:59:23| Is it your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10763)|
| 2:59:24| My department, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| Here's what concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10766)|
| 2:59:28| There's several of us here that own commercial property, residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10768)|
| 2:59:32| I got a building that was built in 1890.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| I'm remodeling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| I'm working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| You know, everybody out here, that school belongs to everybody out there in the audience and all of us up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10778)|
| 2:59:45| And, Dad, Jim, how did it get in the shape that it's in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10785)|
| 2:59:49| You know, it's a valuable piece of property at some place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10789)|
| 2:59:53| And for us to let that go like it did, we're the ones that lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:58| You know, it's the people in the maintenance that have their vehicles and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| We change the oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10802)|
| 3:00:03| We do the maintenance and stuff required there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| And that's an asset to us, and we're losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| And now that the roofs come out, what Commissioner Lambert took the pictures of, I mean, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10808)|
| 3:00:14| we really lost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| We could have put a tarp over it, if nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| It was in bad condition when we got it in 2002, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| We patched the roof out of line item funding in my property management division to the point where we had no more money to spend on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10824)|
| 3:00:35| Well, you know, I guess that's where you guys need to come to us and say, guys, we've got an asset out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10835)|
| 3:00:40| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:41| Let's say an asset's worth $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| We've got an asset of $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| I need $20,000 to keep this thing in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10845)|
| 3:00:48| And then let us decide, you know, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| I've done that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10851)|
| 3:00:54| I've spoke to some of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10854)|
| 3:00:57| I stay in constant contact with John Troyer, the finance director, in regard to the condition of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10857)|
| 3:01:04| and what it will cost to do the kind of repairs that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10864)|
| 3:01:08| And also, Ms. Trent can tell you that she and I talk about it quite frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10868)|
| 3:01:13| and ways of trying to shore up the building or button up the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10873)|
| 3:01:20| But at this point, I haven't been offered any funding to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10880)|
| 3:01:26| You know, I just want us to look what else we've got around here in Knox County that I hope that we're not deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10886)|
| 3:01:31| And then all of a sudden, well, guys, it's in such bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| Now we're just going to have to let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| But, you know, I look at the bricks going to bring you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10895)|
| 3:01:39| The doors will bring you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| The windows are going to bring you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| The flooring is definitely going to give you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| The beams and stuff up there, I mean, there's some remarkable things that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10906)|
| 3:01:54| I'm just leaning toward the commissioners in that district, what you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| Let me clarify something here, Hugh, and for you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10918)|
| 3:02:03| That school has sat there, I believe, since 1976 empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:09| The school board kept it until 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10933)|
| 3:02:14| And it was in that kind of shape when we inherited Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| It was a school system that did not keep the building up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| Is that correct, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:24| I believe they used it for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| And they did, from what I understand, the minimal to get by with the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:31| I mean, I was just embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| They were ready to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:33| They had the bulldozers out on a Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| and they were going to work on Monday morning, and they were taking that building out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| Commissioner DeFriese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10963)|
| 3:02:44| There's another person in the audience that I'd like to hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| And his name is Jim McLean, and he is very familiar with this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10968)|
| 3:02:53| and I would like to hear what he has to say and then comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10973)|
| 3:03:07| Please forgive my appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10987)|
| 3:03:08| I didn't anticipate being at the podium today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| And when I was on the school board, I never dressed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| Mr. McLean, we need your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| I'm sorry, Jim McLean, 5517 Oakside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11002)|
| 3:03:23| In the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11003)|
| 3:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:25| And I will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| I applaud you for trying to get the work done, but the meetings will be as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| I was here last month till 1.30 a.m. also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| But I initiated the call to Mr. DeFriese and agreed with her and her principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| that perhaps tearing the building down could be a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11020)|
| 3:03:46| I grew up next door to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| No one here has a more intimate relationship with that school than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| We climbed those mimosa trees out front and played in the schoolyard as kids did back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11032)|
| 3:03:59| But when I was on the school board, and we inherited that building from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| When the city went out of business in 88, 89, the county inherited that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11043)|
| 3:04:08| And it was built in 1937.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| The roof is the original roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| Now, if you add that up, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| Sixty-three, 71 years, the age of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11055)|
| 3:04:20| It's a tin roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| So when I was on the school board in eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| I really anticipated trying to get the money to tear the building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| Even though I grew up there and went to school there seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:33| I was in the first graduating class of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11073)|
| 3:04:37| But we just didn't have the money to do what we needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| And that's really why they declared it surplus and gave it to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| They didn't have the money to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11085)|
| 3:04:48| They anticipated wanting to put a roof on it, but that would only be part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11088)|
| 3:04:54| But in 02, and the maintenance department, the school maintenance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11094)|
| 3:05:01| wanted to tear the building down and put up a two-story metal warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11101)|
| 3:05:07| Well, the board tentatively approved that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| but I was in Yellowstone trying to recover from a snow machine accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11110)|
| 3:05:17| and they said, let's wait until our chairman comes back and see how he feels about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11117)|
| 3:05:22| Well, it didn't take me long to realize that I didn't feel good about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:27| And even the community, I didn't get one single call from a community that said they were opposed to tearing it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11127)|
| 3:05:35| Their problem was putting up a two-story metal warehouse in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11135)|
| 3:05:40| And the board was gracious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| and the leader got the support to say that we weren't going to put a commercial building in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11142)|
| 3:05:50| And that's why that was killed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| And then I guess it was in 03 that the school system decided they didn't have the money to do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11153)|
| 3:06:01| Anyway, there was a deal or two on a lease agreement that fell through, and parking again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| I talked to the school system this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| I talked to two gentlemen that I respect greatly, and they are either at the top or near the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| And they said they still need parking there because the Sarah Simpson Tech Center is adjacent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11174)|
| 3:06:20| and they have a lot of folks that use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11180)|
| 3:06:23| When I was on the board, we redid the gymnasium and made a great meeting hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11183)|
| 3:06:27| So that portion that was built in 52 is the portion that you aren't considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:33| It's the old portion built in 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11193)|
| 3:06:37| And very quickly, my problem, even though the memories are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11197)|
| 3:06:43| they're going to exist whether the building does or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11203)|
| 3:06:48| And having people live in my old school room, that's just a bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| It's really a business decision in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| The building is one thing and the land is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11216)|
| 3:06:59| When you give away, and you'll be doing that, it'll be very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11219)|
| 3:07:03| When you give away the building, you're giving away the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11223)|
| 3:07:07| And it would make sense in business fashion that the building, if it could not be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11227)|
| 3:07:13| and the county maintained ownership, not give it away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11233)|
| 3:07:19| then it would make sense to demolish it and keep the land, make it green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11239)|
| 3:07:26| and leave it to another generation that follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11246)|
| 3:07:31| And I've thought an awful lot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| I worked on that for eight years on the school board and gave a lot of thought to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| But those are just my views at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| Mr. McClain, does not the school board have plenty of property between Dogwood Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11260)|
| 3:07:46| and the 52 Park to add parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11266)|
| 3:07:50| You know, I can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| I believe Ms. Trent can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:54| They've got quite a bit of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| As a matter of fact, it is on the first deal we got on it that we're even trying to work trades out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11275)|
| 3:08:00| There's plenty of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11280)|
| 3:08:01| But what you get into when you tear this building down is we're talking about roughly $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:08| It'll probably exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| When you tear it down, you've got two and a quarter acres left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11290)|
| 3:08:14| If that property would bring $50,000 an acre, you're still $125,000 in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:20| Plus, all you have is a piece of property there to maintain, mow, and do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11300)|
| 3:08:26| The county needs to get rid of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| I don't know how, but it's a losing proposition right now for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| And we've got to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| And, like I say, if it doesn't bring a proper price at auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| if we have somebody that wants to buy this building and they think they can save it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11319)|
| 3:08:43| that's what we need to do and sell it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| And if we don't like the price that it's bringing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| we still have the opportunity to turn it down and take other avenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| Well, I like that, Paul, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| But on the other hand, I think it's money well spent for future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11336)|
| 3:09:00| As you recall, $250,000 20 years ago was an awful lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11340)|
| 3:09:05| But it might be something worth doing to make green space from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11345)|
| 3:09:09| And I really don't think the community, based on O2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11349)|
| 3:09:14| their complaint was the metal warehouse not tearing down the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11354)|
| 3:09:19| And I also asked the school system this morning what kind of response they have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:24| and they said we've received about four or five calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| That's not a groundswell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| But I've thought about that an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11369)|
| 3:09:30| I'd love to save that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| But I would hope that the county does not lose ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| Well, you know, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| I've heard nobody hollering about saving the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11378)|
| 3:09:40| But the thing about it is if we can get it on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11380)|
| 3:09:43| some individuals are willing to step forward and buy it at public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11383)|
| 3:09:47| then that's the way it needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| We don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11390)|
| 3:09:51| What good is the green space going to be for no more than it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11391)|
| 3:09:54| There's parks all around the place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11394)|
| 3:09:56| We've got Rock City Ballpark right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11396)|
| 3:09:58| It's still less than a mile from the place, Rock City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| You've got Sam Duff Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| We've got the soccer fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| That's our problem in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| We've got all these parks, but they're not big enough to whip a caddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11407)|
| 3:10:10| And that's the reason why I would really like to work a deal out with Alex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| Shubert and trade this property and get some money where we can have a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11413)|
| 3:10:18| How much space do you need to whip a caddy, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11423)|
| 3:10:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11425)|
| 3:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11426)|
| 3:10:27| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11427)|
| 3:10:28| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11428)|
| 3:10:29| I just want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11429)|
| 3:10:30| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11430)|
| 3:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| Thank you, Jim, for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| I am in agreement with Jim that I did tour the Sarah Simpson Development Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| that day, immediately following the tour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11440)|
| 3:10:43| and they actually had materials out in the hallway and were storing things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:48| the lockers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| So I see that we might have the potential for use of the property down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| road, and I just wanted to share that with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| that I did see that there's a need for some space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11458)|
| 3:11:01| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11464)|
| 3:11:05| I just wanted to make sure that people understood exactly what I was talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11465)|
| 3:11:09| about with regard to Clinic Vols and Dr. Cronick's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| What I was interested to see happen would be that a developer would come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11473)|
| 3:11:18| stabilize the building, restore it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11478)|
| 3:11:20| and then potentially lease it back to the county so that the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11480)|
| 3:11:25| could use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| I don't see that a residential development right there attached to the Sarah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| Simpson Center that that's really a feasible thing to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| But this has potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11496)|
| 3:11:38| and then that way that developer can take advantage of those historical tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11498)|
| 3:11:43| credits and utilize that to save the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| I do have a question for Mr. Holt, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| I would like to ask which would be a quicker process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:55| the sealed bid or the public auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11515)|
| 3:11:58| Because I know that Ms. Trent had expressed some constraints with regard to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11518)|
| 3:12:03| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:04| we want to make sure that we do all this before fall sets in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11524)|
| 3:12:07| When you go through an RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| you're probably going to add anywhere depending on where the dates fall for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11529)|
| 3:12:15| the issuance of the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11535)|
| 3:12:18| But you could add anywhere from four to six weeks, maybe longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11538)|
| 3:12:22| Of course, it has to come back to you guys for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| And the process for an RFP at a minimum is 21 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| So if we were able to get that together by the end of this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11551)|
| 3:12:36| get it issued by Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| then you're talking about 21 days from Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| then we have to evaluate it and then bring it back to you for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| Is that the same process for a sealed bid, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| No, that is a sealed bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| An RFP is a form of sealed bidding, competitive sealed bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11570)|
| 3:12:54| Public auction is about a 30-day process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| So it's much longer for the sealed bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11578)|
| 3:12:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| And how much is the potential cost of having a public auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11580)|
| 3:13:04| It would be similar to an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| Most of the expense is borne by the purchaser because we have a buyer's premium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11588)|
| 3:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11593)|
| 3:13:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11594)|
| 3:13:15| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| Earlier today we had a meeting on how to have shorter meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11599)|
| 3:13:24| And I think that what we're discussing here is selling this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11604)|
| 3:13:28| We just either need to say we're going to auction it or we're going to get a sealed bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11608)|
| 3:13:34| And I'd like to see us leave it open without strings attached so that the person purchasing it has to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11614)|
| 3:13:41| to whoever they have to go to to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| That's in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11624)|
| 3:13:45| What we need to say today is let's sell it by some means and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11625)|
| 3:13:50| So, Mr. Wright, excuse me, Commissioner Wright, point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11630)|
| 3:13:53| So are you making a motion to strip the TIF provision and just vote on the auction provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| We already have a substitute motion, so he can't make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11639)|
| 3:14:03| Would you state that substitute motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| Substitute motion is to have a public auction with no ability to have a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11649)|
| 3:14:10| And that's just a county TIF now, Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| And can that be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11652)|
| 3:14:13| If that fails, if that motion fails, I'll make a substitute motion to do as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11653)|
| 3:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11659)|
| 3:14:20| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11660)|
| 3:14:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| I'd like to second the motion but ask the maker of the motion if we could divide the question to sell it at public auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11662)|
| 3:14:30| and then, secondly, either vote for a TIF up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:36| That way some people, I think, will vote to auction it off, but they may not want to add the TIF, no TIF on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11676)|
| 3:14:44| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11684)|
| 3:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11686)|
| 3:14:47| So we've got that done, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11687)|
| 3:14:48| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11688)|
| 3:14:49| No, we have to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11689)|
| 3:14:50| Well, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:51| I mean, I'm all for trying to save this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11691)|
| 3:14:56| I guess my problem is the reason why that I said I'm not in favor of TIF for this particular location is that it's my hunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11696)|
| 3:15:06| my feeling that what I've seen over the years is that this property is not going to bring very much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11706)|
| 3:15:12| In fact, we've not even been able to sell it for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11712)|
| 3:15:16| So if we're going to basically give this property away, I don't think we need to be giving away future tax dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11716)|
| 3:15:26| I think we're doing enough by giving them a piece of property at basically no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11726)|
| 3:15:31| So I just don't think a TIF is in order for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11731)|
| 3:15:37| Okay, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11737)|
| 3:15:38| So you agree to dividing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:41| Well, if they're the makers of the motion, if they want to agree to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| I don't believe the IDB Board will grant a TIF anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| Well, it's going to be divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11750)|
| 3:15:51| Well, I still have the floor, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| I'm just looking down at my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| You know, secondly, talking about TIFs and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| I believe just probably four or five years ago we sold the old Beaumont School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| And I believe they got a TIF on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:05| And you're talking five years later, it looks so much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11765)|
| 3:16:09| It's got some wood nailed up over the windows for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11769)|
| 3:16:13| And I'm sure the people around that neighborhood really appreciates all the work that's gone into that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11773)|
| 3:16:18| So I think this is why we need to sell it at public auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| and then leave it up to code enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11782)|
| 3:16:25| And they'll make people bring it up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| And also if they can get something from the historical, some kind of tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11788)|
| 3:16:34| But maybe the taxpayers of this county don't need to look at giving them a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11794)|
| 3:16:39| because you look at a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| One of them out in the north Knox County where we wanted to get a TIF for some developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11801)|
| 3:16:47| It's going to do some retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11807)|
| 3:16:48| People said, oh, God, we don't need to do retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| Well, retail, we get the sales tax back off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11810)|
| 3:16:53| On a project like this, we're going to get nothing off of it for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| So, you know, if we're going to use taxpayer money, let's use it in a smart way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11817)|
| 3:17:01| where we're going to start recouping some of our money immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| I'm all for saving a building, but let's do it and let the developer do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:08| And if they can get tax credits, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11828)|
| 3:17:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11832)|
| 3:17:16| I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11836)|
| 3:17:17| But first, I see we have a couple of interested parties in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11837)|
| 3:17:21| I wanted to give them an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11841)|
| 3:17:24| Cindy Buttrey is one of our school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| And we also have Joe Holquist here, one of our colleagues on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11847)|
| 3:17:31| If either one of these folks would like to speak, I'd like to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11851)|
| 3:17:35| And then after that, I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:43| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11863)|
| 3:17:44| Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11864)|
| 3:17:45| Name and address, Joe, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| Joe Holquist, 2240 Fisher Place, Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this august body today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| Some of you know more about this than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| I have no idea who knows what, so I'll try to make it brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| but I'll try to give you a thumbnail sketch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| Also, Kim Trent is here from Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| and she may be able to add something, too, because she's been involved in this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11885)|
| 3:18:11| A few years ago, there was a move upon part of the school system to demolish the old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11891)|
| 3:18:19| the 1930s barber design building that's in question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| And we didn't know about it until we saw a trackhoe part next to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11904)|
| 3:18:29| and that's what obviously set off the alarms in a lot of folks' minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11909)|
| 3:18:33| And so we researched it and found out that, indeed, they were planning on demolishing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11913)|
| 3:18:39| I don't think the contract had been inked with Stukesbury Construction at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11919)|
| 3:18:43| but he was anticipating it and had moved his equipment to that point next to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11923)|
| 3:18:49| So we met with the school board in what they call a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11929)|
| 3:18:54| It's essentially a pre-agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| And the dynamics of that meeting were awkward, to say the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| They were planning, I think, one of the school board members had requested to Superintendent Lindsey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11942)|
| 3:19:08| that they have a public meeting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| They agreed to have a public meeting after the demolition of the building, which didn't make a lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11950)|
| 3:19:15| and that got fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| Paul Kelly was a school board member who went to bat for us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:21| Had a public meeting, had a great turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| A lot of people spoke very passionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| People had gone to school there at junior high and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:30| People had a lot of history in that building and with that building over an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:35| They spoke passionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:36| As a result of that, Mr. Lindsey was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11976)|
| 3:19:41| Mr. Mullins was there conducting the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| He went back and talked with Mr. Lindsey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| and they came back with a recommendation to the school board that they hold off on demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11986)|
| 3:19:51| And over a period of months and then years, a lot of work has gone into trying to save that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11991)|
| 3:19:57| And there have been some false starts, as you know, and some difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=11997)|
| 3:20:01| But the community, many people in the community care very deeply about this building, and we want to see it saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12001)|
| 3:20:08| We want to see it restored and believe very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12008)|
| 3:20:11| I believe very strongly, for one, that it can be beneficial and be put back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12011)|
| 3:20:18| On the whole issue of TIFs at this point, personally, I don't know that TIFs need to be on the table at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12018)|
| 3:20:25| I haven't had any discussions with Ms. Trent or anybody else about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| But what I would like to see personally is that it be put up for sale with the stipulation that whoever buys it has to secure it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12029)|
| 3:20:43| stabilize it, put a roof on it, secure it from intruders, et cetera, and within a specified period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12043)|
| 3:20:52| And after that, hopefully they will commit to restoring it or selling it to someone who will restore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12052)|
| 3:20:59| But I'd certainly like to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| As far as TIFs go, I will tell you that the city of Knoxville now has a policy in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12061)|
| 3:21:07| and I was one of the people that advocated for this, to TIF old school projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12067)|
| 3:21:12| And the rationale behind that is, from the city's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12072)|
| 3:21:16| is we believe it's a powerful tool for stabilizing and improving property values in the neighborhoods around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12076)|
| 3:21:23| These schools are key institutional buildings that can be converted to new uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:29| which have a very positive effect on the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12089)|
| 3:21:33| And so we believe that it's worthwhile in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| Again, the city doesn't TIF any project until it meets the criteria, the if-but criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12095)|
| 3:21:42| There's a whole series of criteria there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| And we don't even think about TIFs until we make sure that those criteria have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12104)|
| 3:21:50| But the key here, I believe, is to honor the desire of the people in the community and do everything possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12110)|
| 3:21:57| give the opportunity to save and restore this wonderful old structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12117)|
| 3:22:02| And so that's what I'm here to speak on behalf of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12122)|
| 3:22:06| And I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12126)|
| 3:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12130)|
| 3:22:11| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12131)|
| 3:22:12| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:13| Who was the other person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12133)|
| 3:22:14| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12134)|
| 3:22:16| Cindy Baudry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:17| Cindy Baudry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| Cindy Baudry, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:24| I'll make it very brief, and I apologize for my address, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| but I'll believe you're not here at 1 o'clock in the morning when I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| But very quickly, in regards to the clinic vaults, you know, I serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12152)|
| 3:22:41| I'm vaguely familiar with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| As far as the use, and that's what I just wanted to speak to you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12163)|
| 3:22:47| the board has not ever had a formal presentation regarding clinic vaults, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:57| You know, if there's a use for the building, then that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12177)|
| 3:23:01| I would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12181)|
| 3:23:02| But, you know, I think the larger question comes into play for you guys is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| or not you want it to go back on the tax rolls or whether it comes back to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12188)|
| 3:23:14| That's ultimately what you have to decide, and then after you decide how it's going to be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12194)|
| 3:23:22| You know, I don't think for us, you know, we've had several options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12202)|
| 3:23:27| but nobody wants a metal, you know, warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| And that was what I've heard since I've been on the board is we need the area for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12210)|
| 3:23:36| And I haven't heard anything about any other type of use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:40| So when I hear something different, you know, I'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12220)|
| 3:23:49| You know, when you mentioned that, that was the first I had ever heard about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| So, you know, to my knowledge, I have no other use or didn't know of any other use other than this warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12233)|
| 3:24:03| Well, I know that Dr. Cronick has spoken to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| and has invited them to several things that he has had at the university with regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12247)|
| 3:24:13| You might be familiar with Dr. Stearns out at Boone's County up in Jonesboro is where he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12253)|
| 3:24:21| and Dr. McIntyre has gone with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12261)|
| 3:24:24| And I believe that as long as I've known Dr. Cronick for about two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12264)|
| 3:24:28| he's been talking about this, about the community schools program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12268)|
| 3:24:32| and instituting a clinic attached to a school with a pharmacy and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12272)|
| 3:24:38| And I'm almost positive he's presented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| I know that he's extended an invitation to the school board several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| and it may just be that he's not formally presented it at a school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12285)|
| 3:24:49| It may be more of an informal manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| And I know that he's extended invitations to presentations that he's had at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12291)|
| 3:24:56| But the Clinic Vols program is currently in the school system right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12296)|
| 3:25:00| And I'm familiar with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| And this is just kind of an extension of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| It's a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| He's had to change the name because it's associated with the University of Pennsylvania as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| And that's who he's working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12310)|
| 3:25:11| And so they've changed the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12311)|
| 3:25:12| So that might be part of the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:14| But he obviously will be presenting it to you soon, I'm sure, if he's talking to Dr. McIntyre about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12314)|
| 3:25:21| But he basically has the money to fund this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12321)|
| 3:25:25| He just needs a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| And so this was something that I was presenting to the commission to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12327)|
| 3:25:30| this is a potential use for that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12330)|
| 3:25:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12333)|
| 3:25:34| And I think that's ultimately what it comes down to for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12334)|
| 3:25:37| is after you decide how you want to go about the bid is whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| or not you want the site to go on the tax rolls or come back to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12340)|
| 3:25:45| So that's just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12345)|
| 3:25:48| Mr. Chairman, there has been a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12348)|
| 3:25:51| Please state the question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| Well, the question now is, are we going to sell by public auction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| That's it, just by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12359)|
| 3:26:00| That's a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12360)|
| 3:26:04| Do we want to do the TIF part of it first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| It doesn't matter which way we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| Let's do the TIF part first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| Is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| We'll do the TIF part first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12373)|
| 3:26:17| No ability to have a TIF on this property from the county is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12377)|
| 3:26:23| Explain the question, what's a yes and what's a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12386)|
| 3:26:27| The ability to have a TIF if you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12387)|
| 3:26:30| If you vote yes, there's no TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12390)|
| 3:26:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12393)|
| 3:26:34| No possibility of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12394)|
| 3:26:35| No possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| From the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12396)|
| 3:26:37| From the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12397)|
| 3:26:38| They could still get money from the U.S. government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12398)|
| 3:26:41| They could still get a TIF from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| But I just don't think that if we're going to ultimately give this property away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:48| that we need to be financing the profit for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12408)|
| 3:26:54| Now, if you vote no, that doesn't automatically mean there is a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| That just means that this body in the future will have that option available to them if they choose to exercise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12419)|
| 3:27:06| Well, we always have the option because if there is a TIF, we have to come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12426)|
| 3:27:11| I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| I mean, I am absolutely going to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| That's not to rubber stamp any TIF, but it's just to say I want the option to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12435)|
| 3:27:21| We have a motion on the floor, a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12441)|
| 3:27:26| Not have the ability to have a TIF from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12446)|
| 3:27:28| If you vote yes, that means no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12448)|
| 3:27:31| That means no TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| What we've done is Commissioner Moore has asked to divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12456)|
| 3:27:38| We're just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12460)|

| 3:28:37| I heard more yeses than the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12517)|
| 3:28:40| I did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12520)|
| 3:28:42| They were more vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12522)|
| 3:28:49| The motion fails 14 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12533)|
| 3:28:54| Mr. Chairman, we heard from Councilman Hawke with some very good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| I was wondering if the item before us was amendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| In other words, could we amend it to include his idea that the successful auction bidder be required to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12542)|
| 3:29:10| for example, repair the roof within six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| We've already talked about that, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12552)|
| 3:29:15| Hugh Holt says that will be he has to come back after it and put the stipulations in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12555)|
| 3:29:20| Will that be fine then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12560)|
| 3:29:21| That's the way it's already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12561)|
| 3:29:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| We have a motion on the floor to have a public auction on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12568)|
| 3:29:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12569)|
| 3:29:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12570)|
| 3:29:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12571)|
| 3:29:36| It passes 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| Mr. Chairman, thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| Would there be any way to take a five-minute recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12581)|
| 3:29:46| Well, I've heard from more than one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12586)|
| 3:29:49| We're going to take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=12589)|
