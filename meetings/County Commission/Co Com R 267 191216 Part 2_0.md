| 0:10:46| And then after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| there will probably be some questions from the Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=647)|

| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| My name is Kimberly Northcutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I live at 1635 Old Andes Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| We did agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| He had brought it down to three units per acre on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| My question is now, because of him agreeing with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| is that we were discussing the 30-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| We had gone to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| and they had recommended 2.68, I believe it is, per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| which is now apparently, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| approved at four on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| And I was wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| is this going to bring down the first parcel of the 30-unit acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| down to the three units per acre also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| There's problems on Troutman Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| where the water is giving them issues, as it is from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| The density in the area is much lower than what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| So I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| is that a possibility that this is also going to be brought down to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| You can go ahead and stop our time right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| I'm going to say two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I'm going to restate your question to make sure that I'm hearing it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| First of all, I'm going to say I don't know the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| But it sounds as if you're, to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| you're saying that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| you're supporting what the applicant has said based on what the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Commission has said of a density of up to three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| I'm hearing you're saying, yes, you're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| But you're also saying there's an adjacent property of 30 acres unrelated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| to this specific request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Correct, but attached to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Unattached to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Attached to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Initially, I'm going to defer that question first to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| It could possibly come to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| and then we'll go back to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Sound like a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Sounds like a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I'll attempt an answer and then look to Mr. Sanders to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| The two parcels, the 30-acre parcel that was owned at four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| an acre and this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| which is requested for three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| are owned by the same property owner, all homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| They could combine the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| and average the density on the two properties with the concept plan covering both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| At 30 acres and 17 acres, I'm going to round a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| We would weight the average to 30 acres at four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| Seventeen acres at three dwelling units an acre would mean about 3.7 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=789)|
| 0:13:18| for the entire 47-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Because you'd have 30 acres at four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| 17 units at three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| so you'd take a weighted average and develop the average based on the acreage in each one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| and spread that throughout the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Can I try to sum that up into two sentences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| It will not change the number of units given both of the zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| but it will change the spread over the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| I'm now going to, as I said, I'm going to go defer back to the law director to weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| and then we're going to come back to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I would agree with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| He agrees with Mr. Green, but do you agree with Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| I know my son's got a math test tomorrow, so I don't know if weighted averages was on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| but I'll come back to Mr. Valiant for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| We agree with Mr. Green, Mr. Smith, and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| I'm going to come back to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| And, ma'am, I believe there's another person who wanted to speak, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| Ma'am, if you could please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| I know that there's another lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| You seem to express an interest that you wanted to weigh in on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I think you only used about two minutes or so if you're five, or maybe just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| My name is Michelle Goldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| I live at 9234 Bridges Meadow Lane in the Atlee Fields subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| Our property backs up directly to the last 17 acres that were approved for rezoning at the last commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=898)|
| 0:15:08| You know, you can make data look any way you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| So three units per an acre versus four units per an acre, all depending on the slope, that's really unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| This is the third meeting that I have come to about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| and all I see is the lawyers, the developers just schmoozing with all of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| This is extremely frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| I asked this question at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I do not know who you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Do you serve the Knox County residents, or do you serve these developers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| This developer that's not even from this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| We have shown detailed information about traffic and accidents on these rural roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:52| This Old Andes Road, I bet you none of you have ever been on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| It is seven feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| It is not even paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| This is a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| There is wildlife out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| There is water flooding constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| And I do not know how this commission can sit there and look at this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| and think that this is appropriate just because of your relationships with this builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| This is really unfair, and it's extremely frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:30| We are voicing our concerns because of the layout of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| The 30-acre parcel, the first acres that we were looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| or they were looking to develop, this is on a very large slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| It rises 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| If you add up between the two properties at what they're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| we're going to have 424 cars coming down Andes and Old Andes Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| in addition to what we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| because they use it as a cut-through between Middlebrook and Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| By the way, the stop sign for Old Andes Road sits at the end of my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| That's 424 cars blowing emissions on my property every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| as they stop and start at the end of my driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| That's just on a personal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| But we started out with it only being 2.68 homes per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| on the 30 acres with the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Somehow you guys changed that up to four, and we're not quite sure how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| We weren't made aware that there was a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| That's why we weren't here to oppose it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| But, you know, we're asking you to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| and bring this down to three homes per acre on the 47 acres total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Seeing some lights, and I'll do...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Now, Commissioner Smith, you'd weighed in with your math earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| so I'll be coming to you third after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Mr. Daley and then Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Hickey, if you would, I'd like to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| We've got 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| That's four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Then we've got 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| That is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| So all those total, are you going to spread those out over those, or are you going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| I believe her question was or is that are you going to use the four on the 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| and then you're going to use the three on the 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| or are you going to split those two together and spread your homes out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| So our intention is to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I think my math's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| I think if you did the three units per acre times the 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| and then the four units to the acre times the 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| it comes out to roughly 171 units possible on the combined 47-acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| So our intention is, like Mr. Smith said, is that that's the maximum unit count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| and, you know, we're going to rely on our civil engineer to tell us best how to lay out the number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:04| on the property due to constraints and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| So we're going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| I hope you understand that's going to be 3.7 spread out all over the 47 acres is what you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:26| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| And as far as the traffic, well, we're going to, you know, complete the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| and we'll make any improvements needed per county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Well, I was going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I think we had talked about that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Ron, if you don't mind, we talked about the traffic last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| There were improvements included in that as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| In the last...or whatever the last rezoning were, weren't there improvements included, Andes Road and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| Yeah, we're going to...whatever the traffic study says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| I'm sure there's going to be improvements to old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Right now I think the road is 13 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| We don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Yeah, let's...we're having a conversation here, not a yelling match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| But our plan is to improve the roads out there to meet county engineering standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| What's the length of old Andes Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Approximate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| About a third of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| About a third of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| I, too, am trying to think about...think back to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| I believe it was the October meeting that this came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And I think we asked very specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| are you prepared to make improvements the entire length of old Andes Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| And your answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Is that...am I remembering that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| I mean, I'd have to go back and look at exactly what was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| but I mean, I believe that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| we're willing to make whatever the engineers say we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| to fix the roads to county standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| I mean, I don't know if that's Andes...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I don't know if that's part of Andes Road at this point, part of old Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| You know, I'm sure it's part of old Andes Road or all of old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| There could be improvements on Andes Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| You know, I'd have to rely on the engineers to determine exactly what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| whether it be, you know, widening roads or turn lanes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| So if Knox County Engineering came back and said you need to widen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and make improvements the entire length of old Andes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| that's something you're prepared to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Are there any other...I think the homeowners have a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| obviously have a large concern about the second piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| or really the entire piece of property coming right up against the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| Is there anything else that you're doing to help, you know, mitigate a buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| or any other barriers to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| Is there any plans yet or have you not gotten to that point yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We have hired Full Joe McIndoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| They're working on a concept plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| It's not complete, but we will have that back in front of the municipal planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| within the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| Under the USUN review or concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Absolutely, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| That process obviously then looks at, obviously, the layout and the density and the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Wasn't there also, if I'm correct, wasn't there also part of that 30 acres that was unusable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| I can see a lake on it or some sort of pond on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah, there is a pond on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I'm trying to remember how much of that was unusable space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I don't know if we have an exact acreage count at this point with the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| but there is a pond on the area and a cemetery that will have to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| I've got a question for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| The neighbors have brought up, and this was in the documents here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| concerns about the slope and the Knox County slope guidelines that we try to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| I wasn't in the planning commission meeting when this passed through there to come to us last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| Tell me a little bit about the slope of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| and with a plan, are there areas they're not going to be able to build on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| Is this something that Howard Slope is going to be protected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| Are they going to be able to meet the Knox County slope guidelines on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| The property on this foot I have is for this 17-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| 12.3 acres are between 0% to 15%, 3.91 of 15% to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| 0.56 is 25% to 40%, and there's none over 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Based on the slope and using the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| and the recommendations of the Hillside Merge Stop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| the recommended density under that is 2.68 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| The planning commission rounded that to 3 dwelling units per acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| When we review the concept plan, we try to work with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| and his design team to limit the disturbance of the steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| One of the goals of the planned residential district is to concentrate development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| in the more environmentally appropriate areas of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| But there are no other than the Hillside Merge Stop Protection Plan is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| It's not mandatory, so it very much depends on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| and the planning commission's review and approval of that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I know this body has done our best to always follow the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| of the slope protection guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| Call on the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Unbiased opinion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| I don't know about that, but I'll try my best. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Andes Road or Old Andes, we say 7 foot, and we see 13 foot. What is the width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| And obviously, you know, it's been a long time since I've been on Old Andes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| but I would think it would be in the neighborhood of about 13 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| I think 7 feet, we would have a lot more calls on it than what we currently do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| so I would put it in the 13-feet range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Mr. Jahemy, was that a third of a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| So if engineering, the road stay comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| you will require them to fix the road at 26 feet wide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| Maybe not 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| That's internal to subdivisions on roadways that lead up to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| We would definitely want to at least see 20 feet from Andes Road to their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| and then possibly some improvements along Andes based on what the traffic study indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| And Mr. Hickey has agreed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Actually, Diane, I think you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| You raised your hand before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:53| Sorry, I'm just very emotional about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| The problems that we see are that I live on Old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| I live directly on the corner of Old Andes and Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| It comes like this, and the property that goes in between those two belongs to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| You have already given away the right-of-way to two of the people who live on this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| so their properties are already at the point where you cannot widen this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| to make it wide enough for two cars to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| If you're going to do that, you're going to be stealing property away from homeowners to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| Plus, the property that runs between Andes and Old Andes sits at a difference in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| quite a big difference, and there's trailers along that property also, at least one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| But at one end of it, there are several homes, one which has just finished getting built this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| So there's not really a way for you to widen this enough for two lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| I don't know how you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Plus the fact that we have the church on the corner of Andes and Old Andes at the other end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| which on the weekends, they literally take up the entire Old Andes property on the road up past the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| So you really have to go the other way on Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Also, Andes Road and Chert Pit, where Andes Road comes and then turns left and Chert Pit goes this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1691)|
| 0:28:20| That hill there has so many accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| In the summertime, we sit there and we can hear it happening because we're only a few feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| Was it last night or two nights ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| We just had a terrible accident right in front of our driveway because the road comes around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Andes Road comes around so steep and then goes downhill that a person lost control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| and ended up taking out the power pole, so we were out of power again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| And this is the type of thing that we're fighting here, is to say we're not trying to stop fall homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| We look forward to them coming to the area, but it has to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| I'm worried about the accidents that are going to be brought on by this additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Andes Road cannot absorb that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| You need to drive up Andes and Chert Pit and see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| It's dangerous at that corner, very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| And that's what I'm asking you to please, before you decide this, studies have to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| so that we can get to a reasonable amount of traffic and road repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| because I don't think you can do what you want to do on old Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you. I really appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Before she leaves, can I ask a question of her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Sure, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| When you said we gave away the right-of-way, what were you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| When you're on old Andes, and it's approximately halfway between old Andes and Andes on one end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| and old Andes and Andes on our end, there are homes that have been built right along the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| And right across the street is the property that they have, that I think they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| They would have to build it on their property, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| They would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Actually, if they sell it or rezone it or whatever, they lose road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| They lose road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| But so do people that have trailers that are right up against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| It doesn't affect the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| It just affects the side that's purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Whatever's redrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| And there are homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| But only on the property they drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Only on what they buy is how it affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| And so, like my lot is smaller than my neighbor's lot because we had to redraw it when I bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| I lost road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| He didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| Well, these homes would all lose frontage, and so would I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| Because for you to widen that road there, you're going to have to take it out of my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| I'm going to continue looking at maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| Is there a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| Commissioner Green, perhaps this is a question for you or Mr. Sanders, just about process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Is there a process in where the traffic and engineering study is done before zoning is approved to determine the viability of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1851)|
| 0:31:02| There is not, and that's challenging because we don't know what the development will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| For example, on this property, the zoning is planned residential recommendations, planned residential up to three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1868)|
| 0:31:17| They could develop it at three units an acre or at one unit an acre, so it's hard to predict exactly what the development would be before the zoning is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| and then the concept plan comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| So that's why the traffic impact analysis is required, a concept plan, when we have the plan for the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| and can see what's anticipated for the property as opposed to the range of uses that's permitted under the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| So process-wise, I just want to make sure we're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Let's say zoning is approved at whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Then they bring back a concept plan that shows the layout and the structure and the whole division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| and then the traffic study and engineering study gets triggered based upon that, and they say this many cars, 400 cars are going to come through a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:06| and that road perhaps cannot handle that amount without significant improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| Each one of those processes still comes back through planning and through planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| and at any point planning commission can say it's not viable, your plan isn't viable because the traffic study says it's not viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| So there's sort of stop gaps along this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| That's correct, and I think what Mr. Hickey was referring to in agreeing to do the transportation improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| system improvements recommended by the transportation impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| that's part of the approval process for the concept plan and the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| But at that point the zoning is set already, so you can't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| So you really do have a chicken or egg scenario here in which you can't go back and say, hey, look, it's not viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| That shouldn't be at that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| It should be at a lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| You can't reverse the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| You can't change the zoning, but, again, the zoning is for up to three dwelling units an acre, up to 3.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| whatever that number may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| If they find that as part of the development plan that 3.7 units per acre does not work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| because they can't do the transportation system improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| or other infrastructure improvements required to accommodate that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| revise their plan and reduce the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| So they do have options in order to address the infrastructure issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| And is there, sir, if I could ask a question, is there, I know there's not a concept plan yet to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| but is there preliminarily a one entrance, one exit portal on this property with these two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| 47 acres just going to come in and out of one place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Yes, I believe that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Are there other, I mean, it seems like a tremendous, I mean, how many total homes approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| Ballpark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Ballpark, 170.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| So are there other developments, and is that, I might look to both of you to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| 170 houses that go in and out of a single point of entry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| That's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Is it good planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| Are there other examples of that around Knox Canyon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| More than you can count on all the fingers and toes in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| Typically, when you would see a larger increase in homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| a lot of times there's boulevard entrances to separate the lanes of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| And also, oftentimes there's turn lanes required and what they call stacking lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:52| which is where cars come up to a stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| But you're going to come out on, even with turn lanes, you're turning off onto an old country road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| You're not turning off onto a boulevard or another major artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| But we plan on, I fully expect that the traffic study is going to make the country road a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| acceptable to county engineering, which is going to make it a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| like Mr. Snowden said, a 20-foot wide road with paved striping and things like that to where today it's not what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| Is Andy's Road, maybe this is a question for Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| is Andy's Road a more adequate road, a larger footprint and infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:36| I mean, looking at, I'm just trying to gauge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| It's a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| It probably ranges in width from 17 to 18 feet with center and edge lines dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| So it has some issues, but it's very much like a lot of our county roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2148)|
| 0:35:56| And so Chert Pit and obviously Middlebrook are the biggest feeders of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| This is a cut between, so to speak, a county road that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| It runs from Andy's over to Middlebrook, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| I think I might have more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| I see you, Diane, in Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I think you weighed in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I recognize Diane in Montgomery, but I want to let Commissioner Gil go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| I wanted to hear from the opposition, but I needed to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Is the road improvement first or your home bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| As part of developing the subdivision or I think any subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| the road improvements would be completed at the time the roads were built for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| So the road improvements will be complete before any homeowner lives in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Are you making the road improvements first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| I understand you'll build out in the process of building homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| but the road improvements to get to those homes before people occupy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| That's the clarification I'm trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I just want to hear from the rest of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| I recognize Diane Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| If you could please go ahead and state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| and then I will go back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| I'm Diane Montgomery, and some of you know me from North Shore Corridor activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| and other projects, and I'm here actually tonight about another matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| and didn't know that this one was on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| and just realized sitting back there that I happen to be a property owner adjoining this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| and pretty familiar with Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| I don't see how they're going to do what they're proposing to do with that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| and as someone suggested, it would be a really good idea for you all to see it before approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| It is a terrible slope situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| It is what I would call a pioneer trail that's been paved over, and there's just not much there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| But I would respectfully request that you all postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| and give other property owners a chance to weigh in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| because this is a really bad proposal from what I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Strong support of these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| And I appreciate Commissioner James for a very thoughtful question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Actually, do have a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| I do want to get to Commissioner Schoonmaker, but I'll allow you to finish your statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| but I do need to get to Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| So, Commissioner Schoonmaker, you might even have a question for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Mr. Hickey, you have a number in your head for the number of homes for these two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| Can you do this for, say, 150 homes for two parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2323)|
| 0:38:51| I'd have to go back and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| And the number I set in my head is only based upon if you do the zoning at 4 times 30, 3 times 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2333)|
| 0:39:02| Our engineers are still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| I've never done a project yet that didn't come out at quite a bit less than the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| the density that ends up being engineered ends up less than what the actual zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| But I don't know what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Well, and if I might weigh in, I think one of the things that we've heard from you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| that may have everybody worried is you've been consistent saying we're going to do whatever Knox County says for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| They'd probably like to just hear you say this is what we're going to do and meet these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| Just an observation on the way this conversation is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| But back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Sorry to go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| I'm just trying to formulate the question in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| In October, we went through the rezoning process on the front 30 acres, if I'm remembering correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| And I'm guessing since then you're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| We talked about road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| We talked about all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| My guess is you're working on a concept plan for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| I mean, you're not waiting on this other thing to zone to start figuring out the whole big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| So everything is waiting on the second part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Did you not own the second piece when you rezoned the first piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| No, we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| So you've acquired that since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| We have both of them on our option to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| So we waited until we got the 17-acre piece because from an engineering perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| and I think from a planning perspective, it works a lot better if they design it all as one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| So that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| But assuming a bigger project has the ability to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| The first piece that we had this discussion about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Thank you, Mr. Jake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Mr. Hunnicutt, you gave us a little readout here of some concerns that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| And item number five is kind of concerning here about the environmental impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| And you mentioned three addresses, 1621, 1623, and 1635.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| And it says that the movement of this earth would result in some, I guess, backup or wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:40| And these three homes that you're talking about, it says it had septic system drain fills on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:50| I know this is going to be addressed when they do the plot plans, when they go out there and set how the houses are going to lay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2510)|
| 0:42:02| Have you seen, Mr. Green, have you seen any of this request about what's happening on those three lots that has to be addressed in the planning stage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:13| I received the correspondence from Mr. Hunnicutt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| We have not seen any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| I mispronounced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| But I have not done any investigation of drain fills or any impacts on 1621, 1623, or 1635 Old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| So, but this will be addressed in your planning stage, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Only to the extent that they would have to have a stormwater management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Other than that, it would not be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Is there any additional discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| I'll look at the, Ms. Montgomery, I'll give both sides on this an opportunity to make a final statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Go ahead, Diana, if you or some of the other folks from the opposition would like to make an additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| I just had a question, and that is that I don't know what the sewer arrangement is for this property, and I'd like to hear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| Can you bring your mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I'm sorry, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I was just saying that I'd like to know what the sewer arrangement is for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| Actually, that question is probably better proposed to engineering and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| We have West Knox Utility Districts, we have adequate sewer access to their facilities, to tie into their facilities for public sewer and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Mr. Snowden, you want to comment on that additionally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| I'm pretty familiar with that network of water and sewer, and I would concur with what Ryan said in regard to West Knox's capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Yes, and you wanted to speak again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| Thank you, I really do appreciate your time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| As far as stormwater runoff in that area, like I said, I'm right on the corner there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| the runoff right now goes through a small stream that's on our property and ends up on the property that they want to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| That pond that we're talking about, the water actually goes underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| So I don't know how large it is under there, but that's going to have to be checked out also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| And we're on septic, and there's no sewer system along this area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| And if you need to bring in sewers on top of widening our road, that's going to require additional frontage off of these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:41| and it's just not there, is what I'm trying to tell you and explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| is that there's not enough room for a double road and sewage going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| And what, we're going to have to hook up to this sewage also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| That's going to be now in my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| There's just not enough land to do this, is what we're trying to get you to understand and ask that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| I guess I've got, how close is the connector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| And I'm looking to either Jim or someone who's more of an expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| How close is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| You just said most of the folks out there are on septic tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| I mean, at least you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| But, I mean, how close is the sewage line with the utility district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| There's two points that you can connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| The adjoining subdivision, Atlee Fields, which some of these people live on, is on West Knox sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| And then on Andes Road, West Knox has a main trunk line running down Andes Road that has several manholes that are existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| So there's two ways that you can service this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Can I just ask what the motion on the floor is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| We do not have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| We've gone through debate where both sides have been able to weigh in on it, but there's not been a motion on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| I'd like to make a motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I'd like to make a motion to just defer, postpone for 30 days if that doesn't hold up any legalities of continuing the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| I just would like some more information, and I think that this is a – we had a lot of discussion when it was 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| but now that it's essentially almost doubled in size, I think there's a lot of information that I just would like to have more time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:30| and look at the property and maybe talk to, you know, spend a little bit of time there before making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| So I'd like to make a motion to just postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Okay. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| We have a motion and a second – motion from Commissioner Jay with a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| Additional debate, I'm going to go to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Well, I just – and I don't know that I disagree or – I mean, I don't disagree with Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| but all the email correspondence that we received over the last three or four days, or recently, it all was very recent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| but it was don't let them above three, and now we're having this conversation of don't let them above – there's no number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| And so that was – I mean, I thought we were, at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| whenever Mr. Valiant came up and said we're dropping it, we're going to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| And so I wonder why the target's moved on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| I mean, I don't necessarily disagree with the deferment either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| I'll go ahead and recognize Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| We've got contracts that we have to live by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| And to postpone it, you may as well just deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| Now, we're talking about two separate pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| The 30 acres has already been zoned, and it's already – it's got the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| MPC, the law department, all of us have come in here agreeing that what we have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:57| three units per acre would be a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| These guys that we're dealing with, Ball Homes, they do everything they say they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| They're a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| They've been a good member of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| They help everybody out that needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| And to have somebody come up and denigrate them and say they're schmoozing commissioners and doing all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| that's insulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| These guys have done good work since they've been in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| They do what they say they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| And we've agreed to improve the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Everybody's talking about the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| We've agreed to do what the Department of Engineering has asked us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| I don't know what more we can do and why we're getting jerked around over what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| This is the first time in 40 years I've seen somebody come in and agree with MPC that's a good developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| and is a good citizen and a good community member and they're tearing them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| To me, this is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| Thank you, Mr. Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Just a second, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| I do want to get kind of back to the very beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Just to fairly acknowledge one point of Mr. Valiant's is at the very beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| and that's why this has been a little bit, I wouldn't say confusing, is at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| the opposition said he did announce that, well, we're actually dropping this to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| and the opposition said we agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| So we've done a lot of discussion maybe around the concept of the whole thing, too, on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| So that's just, I guess, a little bit, I mean, frankly and personally, I was pleased when I heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| It's like, okay, you're at three, and I was like, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| I mean, the only other alternative was I think someone had said 2.78 or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| or whatever the number that was also thrown in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| So I guess I just, we do have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| and I want to find out if there's any additional discussion on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| That is what I heard, and I just kind of wanted to restate what we had gone over earlier in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| I would like to make a substitute motion, and everybody understand how the process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| I make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| If it passes, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| If it fails, we're back to Commissioner Jay's original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| The developers indicated that either vote it up or vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| so I will make the substitute motion to rezone it one to three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:38| Per KC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| That's not what they recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| The commission did, didn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| I thought they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Did they agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| We agreed to the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Chair recognizes Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| Is the problem the density or the problems that may go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| Is that what you're talking about, like when they start developing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| I mean, some of this in here talks about slope protection and drain fields, but is the density the big problem now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:24| I'm asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| You're asking the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Yeah, the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Well, there's a couple issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| I think initially it was approved about three per acre, but then we found out we're talking about 3.7 units per an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| and in some areas four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| So that got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| I'll kind of explain that in just a second, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And then there was another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| And then, of course, I'm back to Commissioner Jay where we've got a big issue with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| So Ball Homes only seems to care what's happening on that property, and once those homes are built, they're gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3113)|
| 0:52:02| and no one here is concerned about Andes Road and accidents on Andes and Chert Pit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:10| and what this is going to do to Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| We haven't even talked about the fact that Andes is a very steep incline that comes right down to Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| and there have been trucks and school buses that have gone off the road there because it's a very sudden drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| So I think that needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| You guys don't even know this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| How can you make a decision without at first taking a drive at least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| I'm sorry that the attorney is so upset because we made a comment that hurt his feelings, but we have to be responsible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:45| And I'm sorry he's got contracts, but this is going to be in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| This is going to be in this woman's front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| I'd also like to add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| At the original meeting of this for the 30 acres, we all met afterwards after talking to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| when it had been approved at 2.68 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| And we met outside with this gentleman here, and we all spoke to him and talked to him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| Hey, can you keep us in the loop as to what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| We'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Now, my husband had tried to contact him numerous times and was never given a call back about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| That's why we didn't know about your commission having this meeting and going up to four on something that had been previously set at 2.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:37| And that's what's got us worried is this is creeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| And like I said before, the traffic on this area cannot at this time, or I don't see how you're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:48| be able to handle all of this new traffic that's going to come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| And she's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Andes Road at the end where the church is drops right down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| And we have had an accident there where a motorcyclist was killed because the bus couldn't stop, and boom, there was the accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| And a wreath sits on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| So, you know, we're not, like I said, we are not here to stop ball homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| But he says he agreed to three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| But then we find out that, well, now we're averaging and we've got new math going on here and it's going to jump up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| It's supposed to be three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| And I would assume that's three per acre of homes or acreage that can handle three homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| and not start cramming in more on this property so that we can make up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| I want to go back to the motion on the floor was for the three acre, three per acre recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I do want to acknowledge Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I haven't turned it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I'm sorry, Commissioner Ressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| The question was, is the density the problem or is it the planning the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| And what you said was, well, we thought it was going to be this density and now we think it's this density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| Is it three units per acre or 3.2 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| What is the density that they need to know that it is out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| On the rezoning request before you, it's for 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| The recommendation is three dwelling units per acre on the 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| In October, you approved rezoning of an adjacent 30-acre parcel at four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| Developed together, they would provide 171 units on 47 acres or 3.638 units per acre on the entire 47-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3330)|
| 0:55:41| Under planned residential, there is no dictate for minimum lot size or placement of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| The homes could be all placed on the 30-acre parcel of 15 acres or spread out over the 47 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| As long as they do not exceed 171 units on the combined 47 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| So, again, what we're just doing here is we're doing a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| The other issues about drainage and that goes through the planning stage when you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| And then you have to address the road problems when you're doing the planning too, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| If we don't do anything right now, nothing's going to happen to where you can get in there and help design your area out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| for the citizens out there to help work with the developer, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| Yes, that's absolutely correct, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| So, if we do the zoning, then you have to go back to planning and you are going to work with them about the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| They talk about roads and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| We'll go back and provide a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| We'll provide a traffic study that not only will be at a public hearing that will be voted on by the Planning Commission staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| we then have to complete design plans that meets Knox County engineering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| And so, even after the concept plan, there's no approval for us to go through before you can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Thank you, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| I have a question for the opposition because, again, I just need to make sure from their perspective of what they're saying is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:23| So, anybody that wants to speak from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| You would be the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| I don't believe what they say that they're going to do because it seems their problem that we're having here is that Ball Homes is not speaking with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| Like I said, we're not trying to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| We really want them to come in and develop the area, but at a reasonable amount so everybody can feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:54| Another problem is this 17 acres is ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Let's start there because I just want to make sure we have a common agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| So, you're not against the three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| They're coming back, and we don't know that they're back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| He says that they're okay with the 2.68, and then all of a sudden we hear it's up to four, and we were waiting to hear when are things going to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:26| It's just going along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| So, here's what I'm trying to understand just based on the maps and information I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| So, are we speaking that your concern is obviously Andy's road, which is your road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| I live on Old Andy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Old Andy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| It cuts right up to like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| It's a triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| So, here's the stop sign, and here's my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| I see some of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| So, really the impact on that road is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| I do not believe it can handle it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| So, I just need to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| And it's how do I get out of my driveway now with 424 cars zooming by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| But, you know, that's just – I'm just joking, but you know what I'm saying, understandably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| We are definitely concerned about the people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| We're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| But if there is a different road cut to deal with the level of traffic for this development, see –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:24| Where are you going to put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| That's where this question is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| They have no frontage on Andy's road that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| That's what we're trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| So, you're saying this is the only entrance and exit of this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| And even if – just so you understand, if they do route up to Andy's, Andy's is not a full two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| There are no markings on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| All you have is knowing that when you get close to each other – and you should have some photos that came in before when we started this on the 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:59| My husband's pickup truck is sitting on Andy's road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| I got the photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| So, there's no other way to put a different road there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| There isn't that I can think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| You've got the church on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| They own that property, and their property ends on old Andy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| And then there's another farm, which might be part of the property they're purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| But there's a home that sits at the corner of Andy's and old Andy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| So, I don't know how they can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| And even if they do route it onto Andy's, you're still going to have accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| You're going to have a lot of accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| You're going to have to – I don't know how you're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| I'm not a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| I don't have one of those to see, to see how they're planning to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| But it would have to be major improvements to the roadways, especially since, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| old Andy's is down here and Andy's is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| And that's at the portion of the road where they want to make this two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| So, my question then to you is if traffic improvements come to old Andy's and Andy's road, how do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| They also have to include the Andy's and Chirkpit Road because the hill there has to be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| the only thing I can see is it has to be cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I'm just trying to seek some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| So, really it is the major improvements to those three roads that impact you, your neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| and the people who live there currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| That's the reason I asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Is it the road or the subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| But the road must come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| No, we're not against building on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| That's not our point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| You're not disagreeing, but it's the road that impacts everybody that lives in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| I just need to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| And now I just need to ask a – because that was – I just got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| I'm Buddy Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| I'm Ball Homes General Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| I don't speak much because Ryan knows more than I do usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| But what's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Sir, could you please state your name and address again for the record slowly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I'm Buddy Goodwin, Ball Homes General Counsel, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| Sir, could you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| So my question talks about the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Could you talk about – I've seen the pictures and I've read the impact of that road because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| the opposition concern is those three roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| And my initial comment was this road has real critical infrastructure deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:22| No, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| And that's why we've made it a point at each of the hearings that we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| And we certainly sympathize with you all's jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| You get these questions in zoning hearings versus – you know, the hearing that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| will go through is the planning commission hearing and the concept plan hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| And before that hearing, all that gets vetted out with all the engineers, all the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| Everybody's well informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| There's not hearsay about whether there's this or that or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| So that's part of the issue here is – and that's what we've been trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| When you improve the density up to three acres, we go down there and we do a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| It may not warrant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| The road – you know, that process will vet that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| That's what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| And so I understand how difficult these questions are to you guys, but part of the problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| it's just – it's not the right forum for them because it all hasn't been vetted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| But we've tried to give you the comfort that it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| We do what we say we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| The improvements that need to be made on Andy's Road will be made or the subdivision won't be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| This man ain't going to let that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| I mean, that's how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| And if we don't build the subdivision, there aren't going to be any improvements on Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| So the dangers and things that you see there now will continue to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| So we do feel like we bring a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| And as Mr. Vance said, we do try to do everything that needs to be done, and we will commit to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| But a lot of the specific answers you're looking for are just through the concept plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| And engineers and all those folks, you know, kind of dictate a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| And we go with what the best recommendations are on stormwater and traffic and all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| So that's the best way I can answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| All right, thank you, Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| Mr. Green, just to clarify, because of the way the residents who live in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| the September MPC meeting, the MPC commissioners voted on the 30-acre track to set the density at 2.62 or 2.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| I believe so, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Because then it rolled next month to Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| and the residents in the area weren't aware that we were going to be discussing the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| because no opposition showed up, then the developer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| I need four units an acre, and then this body granted them the four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| But originally MPC commissioners voted 2.82?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| 2.68, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| 2.68, I'm sorry, 2.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Mr. Valiant, you appear ready to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| Well, there was opposition, and these meetings are advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| Everybody knows when these meetings are supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| You advertise them in the newspaper, or you couldn't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| It would be against the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| Ma'am, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| I recognize Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| This first vote will be to vote approve the calling of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| So if you vote yes, then you agree to have the vote after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| Does that make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| All in favor of calling the question, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| So we'll now go back to having the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| The motion that is before us was the substitute motion that was proposed by Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| His substitute motion was to Commissioner Jay's original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| which was to defer the sign-up for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| And if Commissioner Smith does not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| we will revert back to Commissioner Jay's original motion, which was to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| We're good on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Everybody understand what they're voting for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| So all in – and if I hear mixed sounds, I'm going to go ahead and call a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| But all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| We'll have a – were there two noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| This is not clear enough to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Let's do a roll call vote, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Commissioner Nystrom votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| I want to take a point of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| I think the reason I'm voting yes is because number one, number three was agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| and it doesn't happen without the road improvements, so I'm voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Commissioner Bressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| Commissioner Bressler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Commissioner Beeler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Point of ditto, Commissioner Anders, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| Commissioner Daly votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| I, too, am voting aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4044)|

| 1:10:56| He has been operating his business for over 20 years across the street on Routledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| under a leasehold interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4262)|

| 1:11:06| The property across the street became available to him, almost 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| He purchased the property without getting it rezoned and then sought the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| We had several meetings with the Planning Commission coming up with the best way to rezone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| to address the plans that he wanted to do in moving his business across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| And planned commercial is the rezoning that they ultimately recommended and we consented to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| Much like the conversation we had before, it is a planned commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4291)|

| 1:15:18| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Just one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| I do think there may have been some stakeholders who were not part of the process when some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| changes were made to this, and I just want to make sure that Ms. Starbuck is recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Yes, I will get to Ms. Starbuck, and then I'll probably have some questions to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| She's probably been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| So, Ms. Starbuck, you were here early for forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| You've really had kind of a tour de commission tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| So, thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| So, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Lisa Starbuck, 6233 Babley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| I'm here tonight representing Knox County Planning Alliance, and we really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| county commission recognizing that there are some issues with this ordinance and sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| it back to the MPC for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| And we really appreciate Director Green assembling a working group of ourselves, county staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:31| planning staff, developers, MPC commissioners, community advocates, to try to hash out all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| of the issues related to the plan development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| The discussion was excellent, and we really felt that our concerns were listened to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| discussed, and we were given a copy of the agreement that we had worked out and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| know, was led to understand that this was going to be what was going to be voted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| As private citizens, of course, we all have jobs and families and concerns, and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| get paid for spending our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| So, whenever we can skip a meeting because we think we have something, you know, set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| in stone or, you know, going to be agreed upon, we did not make the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:25| Unfortunately, there were some changes that were made to the plan development ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| after we thought we had an agreement, and MPC passed those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:44| And so, basically what happened was the rural area was added back to this plan development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:56| So, we would ask you commissioners to please reconsider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| We are generally supportive of this idea, and we know that the developers want flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4683)|
| 1:18:12| However, given the extraordinary latitude that this ordinance will provide, we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| that it's really important to test this out in the planned growth area first before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| go out into the rural area and make changes that are irreversible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| If it works out and we do some of these kind of developments and it works great, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:37| can revisit putting it back into the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| But I would urge you to please don't do this to the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:51| Secondly, staff approved some changes to the final plan for slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| The original document said that MPC can consider it a minor change to a plan if slope changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:12| or grade changes, rather, 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| And I think that's a reasonable number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| That's what the city has passed in their ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| However, it got changed to 50% grade change, which is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| And so, we would also ask you to put that back to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| There are some words in this ordinance that we would also like to see changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:43| but I'm not going to ask for those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| The main reason that we'd like to see the words changed is that I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| You know, we've seen that words really matter in an ordinance, the way something is worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| And there's an awful lot of words in this ordinance that are wishy-washy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| They're not very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| They're not very defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| And so, what that does is that creates contention between a developer that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| well, I think the ordinance reads this way, and the community that says it reads this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| and the MPC says it reads this way, and you guys say it reads this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| So, I think that moving forward that there's a lot of things that we can do to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| and strengthen this ordinance, but for tonight, I would ask you to please change these two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| Number one, that would be to put it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| And specifically, I am talking about 6.80.3 authorization, Area A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:53| Originally, it read that the rural area was exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| So, I'd like to see that put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| And then the second thing that we would like to see is in 6.80.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| modifications to approved final plans, minor modifications under Section A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| Number six, altering any final grade by no more than 50% of the originally planned grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| We'd like to see that go down to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| And as an aside, I would like to say that Walnut Street over here beside the city county building is a 23% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:33| So, 50% is a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to correct a couple of things that Ms. Starbucks said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| Gerald, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| I recognize you, friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Well, I'd like to do it while the memory is fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I'd like to be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Gerald, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| Commissioner Skinmaker's light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| As chair of the commission, I'm going to recognize Commissioner Skinmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| and then I absolutely will get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| Remember, I gave you the opportunity to speak first on this, and then we're going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| So, sorry, friend, but I'll go back to Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Just so you guys can follow along on the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| that she's referring to on the website, and for the first one, and then on page 11 for the next one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:26| so if you wanted to read where those go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| And on page 6, the first one is 6.80.03, and it's under letter A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:37| where the added word would be a plan development is not authorized in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| And then on page 11, 6.80.6, it's letter A, and then it's down number 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| and substituting the number 20% to the number, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| substituting the number 50% for the number 20%, so that way you can follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Now, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| I don't have a light, so I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| Okay, I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| But the draft sent to the planning commission was what the stakeholder committee said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| It did not have the change in initiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| That was a recommendation change made by the planning commission during their hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| In fact, in the staff report accompanying this, I stated that I did not make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| That was recommended by county staff, but I did not make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| I left that to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| The staff report was available on the planning website prior to the meeting had been accessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| The provision on 6.80.07A6 was proposed by the stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5022)|
| 1:23:52| a member of the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| There was no opposition to it at the stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| so it was included in the draft that went to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| This does not mean that a grade of 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| means a change in the grading of up to 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| So if you're grading one acre of a 10-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| and then you decide to grade one and a half acres, that can be approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| But a change of more than 50% in this, I defer to Mr. Snowden on the details of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| But, again, that was identified by a member of the stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| and there were a few minor comments, but no objections were made to that at the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| It's, again, up to you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| I just wanted to clarify, first, that the initiation change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| and the initiation was a recommendation from the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| after that question was asked of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| and the 50% changing to allowing alteration of up to 50% in the grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| was discussed by the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Just to clarify, those are good questions for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| and things that you will have to consider as you review this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Ms. Starbuck, by the way, I do want to recognize some of the commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| You had a chance to speak first, so just out of fairness to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| I am going to go in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| The commissioners, you've already said something, and you will be given a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| I agree with Ms. Starbuck on this rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Most of my south Knoxville area is rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| We've got growth areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| and let's see what this does in the growth areas first, planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| I do agree that I could accept that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| Mr. Snowden, you're the engineer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| Help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I've seen 50% and then pretty steep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| so help us out on why we should not be at 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| Actually, I want to get a clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| because that wasn't a change that I was necessarily directly involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| We're talking about not 50% grade, 50% changing grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| Changing the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| So essentially what you would have if you've got a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| let's say you've got a 6% grade on a set of plans and it changes 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| that means it would go change by 3%, so it could go to 9% or 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| That, to me, I tend to kind of concur with what Gerald and the Planning Commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| I don't necessarily think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| If you look at it from a 50% grade, yeah, that sounds drastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| but it's 50% changing grade, so I think that's reasonably appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:43| So if I've got a 10% grade and I want to grade some more, I can go to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| You've got a what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| What did you say, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I'm at 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| And I want to grade more, I can go 50%, which would be 5%, which would be 15% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| That doesn't sound unreasonable at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| Keep in mind that those are minor modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| They would have to be approved by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| engineering, public works, planning, stormwater, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| depending on who does minor change, who needs to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| It does not automatically get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| It has to be approved by staff prior to initiating that change in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| and change in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Professional engineering staff in my office would be looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| and there may be times where it could be denied if the severity was problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| but I think oftentimes that condition could be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Ms. Starbuck, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Now this is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| I'm listening to what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| So they ask you or ask a group of people to be stakeholders to make recommendations for this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5274)|
| 1:28:03| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Your whole stakeholders approved a certain document, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Well, actually what happened is we made all these comments and suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| and Mr. Green said that he would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| put them into a document form and send them to us, which he did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| and so which we assumed that was the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| And as I told them, that document went to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| The planning commission made one change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| and the change made by the planning commission was in the initiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| and whether you want to accept that or not is totally up to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| but the document that was sent to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| Commissioner Bussler has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| This belongs to Commissioner Bussler right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I'm working on process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| So you were told you make these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| You all agreed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| You presented the document to Mr. Green, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| Well, he actually presented it to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| and what he is saying is that it actually went to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| in that form, but someone decided to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| The planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Who decided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| The planning commission decided to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| We received a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| Actually, the comment came from Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Okay, hold it, hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| I'm trying to ask a question to get my process going here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| and you two are arguing it out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| We're not arguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Listen, moving forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| I'm sorry it's a late night, and I'm just going to be keeping this tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| Commissioner Bussler has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| He's got a question about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Right now I'm going to let him ask the questions, and you all respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Now, you presented that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| He presented it back to you, which the planning commission changed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| And you saw the changes, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| No, we didn't see the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| We didn't realize that those were going to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| that someone was going to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Okay, what did you get back from him, what you originally presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| or what paper did you have in your hand when you left the conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| When we left the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| it was my understanding that we had an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| that we were not going to put the rural area in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| I think that most of the people on the stakeholders committee understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| that that was what was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| But then it went to MPC, and it got changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Then it got changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| When it changed at MPC, you weren't notified about the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| how they did it on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| No, we were not notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| We were not at the meeting because we thought it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| already agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| And so person or persons unknown evidently made a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:06| It would have been better if somebody would have let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| Well, if you would have been notified that it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| or could not have been changed when it left your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| and it went before the MPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| There were senior planning staff and senior MPC commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| who were part of the stakeholders group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| So we would have assumed that once we had an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| that that would be what would go forward at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| And so you know assuming is not necessarily a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| However, again, we're a citizens group of volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| and you don't have any idea how many meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| and how many hours and hours and hours we spend doing this for no pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| So anyway, the process is what's bothering me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| Because if you had senior staff and senior MPC commissioners on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| and they agreed to that, you should have been warned some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| if you're going to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| there's a possibility that it's going to be changed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| But you assumed, which was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| In and of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| We did assume that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| And with regard to the slope or the grade change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| I'm in the process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| Because that's what we've got a problem with is the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| We commission people to do things and people around you saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| okay, we're taking it to this way to get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| And that's what bothers me that you agree on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| and then like we do here, we sometimes change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| and we don't warn them that that could have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| That's the problem we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| You weren't really warned that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| this could be totally changed when it gets to the commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Mr. Green, would you like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| I apologize for not letting the stakeholders know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| that the planning commission had changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I expect I have said often that any of this is a participatory sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| that if you're interested in a matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| we at planning make everything very apparent on the planning commission website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| The staff report was there noting that we have received a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| that it should be allowed in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| that I was not going to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| That would go to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| As soon as the planning commission approved the revised ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| nothing that goes before the planning commission is ever set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| The planning commission is 15 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| who have different perspectives and make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| As soon as they approve something, it's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| I don't have time, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| to hold the hand of everyone who has an interest in the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| We've worked hard to make that information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| I don't have time to email 50 people every morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| and telling them exactly what the status is on their project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| but we do make sure that that information is readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| After this commission adopts it, we'll put on our website the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| so that we do try to make that information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| If someone is very interested in a topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| we tell them over and over again to check the website for updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| Our website is updated daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| to provide the information that's needed by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Again, I apologize to the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| for not keeping them aware of every change that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| I expect, and maybe I assume wrongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| that people who are interested in a topic will follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Mr. Snowden, you look like you want to weigh in on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Yeah, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| The comment did come from Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| We did meet with Ms. Starbrook and Gerald| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| and various other members of the community that were concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| When we did receive, Mr. Green gave us a deadline to provide comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| and we did provide that comment the day of the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| So we did have it in prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| The main reason that we felt like the rule area would be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| is there are very stringent requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| and the rule area is defined from the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| The general plan is many, many years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| All the areas that are in there that are listed as rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| maybe ain't as rule as they used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| and we just felt like the rule area is where a lot of the developed land is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| and that the creativity and the process would maybe benefit those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| So that was our thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| and we did provide that comment to Mr. Green the day of the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| I just wanted to clarify that from an engineering perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Mr. Green, back just as months and months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| when we started this conversation in more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| I asked you to put together a bit of a site map of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| which you did provide me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| A lot of this is so complicated to understand what goes first, what goes second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| the process, do you go left, do you go right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| what happens if appeals, denies, et cetera, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| and you did provide me with a draft of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I don't know if that's been put into final form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| or if you've provided it to other people yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| We're waiting until the adoption or any action on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| so we know what the final product is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| and then we'll put that on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I'm just looking at a copy of the draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| and it's very well laid out of what happens first, second, third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| and all of the steps in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| and I think it's a really great tool to simplify this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| and I would, once we get through this a little bit further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| encourage you to finalize that, share it, and send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| So thank you for putting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| It's a helpful tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Ms. Starbuck, I mean, no disrespect by this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| I know that your planning alliance is a very active group full of very intelligent people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| who are very good at what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| but as to the process, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| MPC staff put together this planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| When it went through MPC, the planning alliance came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| and asked us to not pass it, to send it back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| And we honored that and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| we'll send it back through and give you all more time to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| But here we are again at the same point on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| So I'm wondering, when it was sent back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| there were things that you all wanted to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Are these still the same things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| Actually, I think that we agreed on 99% of the things that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| It was the last-minute change and then the understanding, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5875)|
| 1:38:04| that we later came upon that what was passed in the city was 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| And if you read the language, I appreciate Mr. Snowden's clarification there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:20| because the language doesn't really say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| What the language says is altering any final grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| by no more than 50% of the original planned grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| and that's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| So, in other words, if you had a 30% grade, then you could change it to 45%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| It's not really very clear, and I understand what the intent is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| but the language is not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| And I don't really understand why 20% is adequate in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| but we have to have 50% in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| This process doesn't allow for a lot of public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| and discussion and decision-making at the time of anything's granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| the right to move forward in a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| Correct. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| I realize we have a motion before us already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| and just speaking as a representative from the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| I do want the rural areas protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I agree that perhaps our general plan is old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| and maybe there are some rural areas that aren't rural anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| but as the general plan is updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| I think the new rural area will be identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| and that will be an appropriate time to decide then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| what rural areas are appropriate for planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| I don't think that is a reason to open up the entire rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| for planned developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| If it's allowable, I'd like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| to amend Section 6.80.03, Subsection A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| to exclude the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| All right. We have a motion for a substitute motion from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| I'm going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| If you could restate that just so we get the number specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Well, it wasn't quite finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| I would like to amend Section 6.80.03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| to exclude the designated rural areas from the planned development authorization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| and to amend Section 6.80.6 under Subsection A-6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| back to the original 20% alteration of the originally planned grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| I heard multiple seconds, but the most recent one was Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| So that is the motion that is currently before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| That is the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| We do not have to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| That is what is on the floor right now, which we will now...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| We did have both...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| And by the way, are you finished with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| Really a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| I think this obviously has been before us on another occasion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| and we acquiesced to sending it back for further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| So this is the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| We're going to have a hearing, a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| and then a second reading, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| In regards to the substitute motion, the rural designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| obviously Knox County is growing at a quite rapid pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| If our general plan...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| I hope the next one doesn't last as long as this one did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| I hope we do a little bit better job in the future of reviewing the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| But, you know, there's not the infrastructure even remotely close to touching the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:56| that Mr. Beeler is talking about with sewer and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| And so leaving it up to the Planning Commission and the engineers to make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| four, five, six years down the road instead of planting our flag in the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| and saying you can't do this, that your land is less valuable to you than the guy before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| I think is unnecessarily dangerous in dealing with property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| And so I hope that we move this forward on the first motion tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:31| and have that public discussion of the things that the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| that Ms. Starbuck and Ms. Frazier and such have been a part of and invested in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| But I don't, I mean, this is the second time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| and I think we just need to let the process work itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| I want to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| I'm not opposed to the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| I was talking about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| And the reason why I was saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| what we do even here at Commission is like a sausage factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| What goes in doesn't come out the way it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| And I should have said, hey, we've got it this far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| but when it goes to Commission it should have been said, hey, it can't be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| But there's some way around there that you've got to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| people are not familiar with the way government works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| and sometimes I'm not familiar with the way that we work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| But we've got to be really specific to let people know, hey, it looks this way going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| but when it comes out it may be completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| And that's what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| So we want to be open and fair to the people that really work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| But we must let them know, hey, it could be changed, and it most likely does be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Once again, I want to get back to the motion that is on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| which is the substitute motion by Commissioner Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| Sorry, the light wasn't on a second ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| If we pass this tonight with a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| and then come back second reading and feel a need to change it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| would that be a substantive change in order to have to start the process back over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| Thank you for that clarification, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| This is something that experiment is not the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| but it is an innovation in terms of how we're trying to develop land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| I keep going back as my reference is I remember that deal that Oliver Smith came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| and I think that was in the planned growth area that Oliver brought to us about a year or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| I'm supportive of Commissioner Wheeler's substitute motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| It might give us a chance to work through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| where the first few times we do this in the planned growth area before it gets rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| I think if we get a few, for lack of a better word, shakedown cruises on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| that might make me more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| I also know that we're in the process of updating our general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| and that would probably be a good way to synchronize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| If changes need to be made to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| syncing that up with the general plan update might be an appropriate time to do something a little bit more broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| That's speaking not as chair but as the fourth district county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| That's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| With that said, back to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Let me acknowledge the hard work that you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| I need to acknowledge the county is going through extraordinary growing pains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| As you can witness, this may look clumsy and not as fluid as we would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| but we have serious work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:53| and we're really trying to make sure that the strategic plan in thinking of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| has lots of public input and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| We have lots of work to do because we're behind by a minimum of 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:09| in our infrastructure and our taxes and our road improvements and broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| and really the direction for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| So bear with us as we stumble through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| because we appreciate many eyes looking at the level of work that must take place here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| because we've got to get this county up and running for the level of growth that's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:32| and we're not quite there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| We appreciate the level of participation to generate the thoughtful process that is needed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Is there any other discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| Everybody know what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Just restate it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| I will look to Commissioner Beeler to restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| The substitute motion is to amend the ordinance section 6.80.03| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:03| to exclude the designated rural areas from planned development authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| and to return the alteration in grade from 50% back to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:19| That's 6.80.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| I think your intent is very clear, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| It's not clear, so I'm going to ask Madam Clerk to do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Commissioner Andrews votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Commissioner Besseler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Commissioner Besseler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6468)|

| 1:48:23| Okay, it passes 8-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| We'll move to a second reading in that form now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| It will be modified and the second reading will reflect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| While we're on this, I was going to bring this up at the Board of Commissioners meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| which will be convened, but while we're on the subject, we do need to schedule a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| for this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| We usually do hearings before the, usually to 7 o'clock or immediately following the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6528)|
| 1:48:54| session meeting, so the Chair would like to propose that we conduct a hearing, a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| hearing on this ordinance following the work session in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:05| Is there any debate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| Just remember that's Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| It is a Tuesday, everyone, yeah, because of the three-day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| Got that, Bustler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| We're checking the basketball schedule now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| Thank you, that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6555)|
| 1:49:16| It's a 9 o'clock game, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6558)|

| 1:49:20| Chris Caldwell, I heard us skipping that particular game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| I think we passed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| That's the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| So that, the work, yeah, I believe is January, I think, is that a five-Monday month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| 21, 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| All right, it's the 21st, that's the Tuesday, yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| So that will be at 7 o'clock, and I'm looking to Driscilla to make sure this notice gets out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:43| The public hearing for this will be at 7 o'clock or immediately following the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| work session on January 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Is that clear for everyone in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| We will, no need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| That's when it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| All right, moving on, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| Item number 51, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| Amendment in the Knox County Code, Appendix A, Zoning Article 2, Section 2.20, Specific Terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6610)|
| 1:50:17| Article 5, Section 5.38.03, Uses Permitted on Review, and Article 4 to add a new Section 4.106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:27| Standards for the Use on Review, Approval of Microbreweries in the CN Neighborhood Commercial District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:34| and Subsection 4.106.01, Minimum Requirements to Define Microbreweries and Identify them as a Use Subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:44| to Use on Review, Approval in the CN Neighborhood Commercial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| This is Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| This is Ordinance O-19-11-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion that we deny this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| There's been some unexpected consequences that could potentially harm adjoining neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| that are adjacent to these six neighborhood commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| What are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| I'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| I mean, it's a drastic change from a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| Yeah, well, I think originally we had talked about hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| and then the thought was brought up that because you would issue a beer permit to this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| that is next to a residential area, that there is that potential that the beer permit be flipped to a state liquor license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6697)|
| 1:51:47| where then the operation could be open until 3 a.m. in the morning, which is adjacent to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:54| And that was not the original intent when neighborhood commercial was first proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| by the Metropolitan Planning Commission several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| So I don't think this is the best way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:10| And the other thing is we have not had anybody clamoring to the podium to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| yes, I've got a business on XYZ, we need to do this, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Hold on, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| Now you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| I mean, it came up for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| Well, again, we've got a policy where any citizen can go to NPC and ask them to change an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:35| and that's how it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| But, again, I just don't think this is the right way with this specific zone that backs up to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:46| And, of course, we originally designed this where there was going to be no commercial at all on some of these corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| and now we've allowed this to open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| But I don't think you need to just open it all the way wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| So I would appreciate your support in denying this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| So we have a motion from Commissioner Schumacher and a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| We'll continue the discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Commissioner Green, I know I used to go ahead and weigh in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| Commissioner Schumacher is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| This request came from a property owner, a business owner in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| who requested that the ordinance be amended, and we do have a process for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| There was a question last month about restricting hours of operation for businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| I checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| The hours of operation are restricted for sanitary landfills, self-service storage facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| contracted storage yard, and rural retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| And with rural retreats, the hours with regard to activities have to be in an enclosed building after a certain hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:52| So there is that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| And I'm no expert in the alcohol laws, so how we deal with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| I know that the zoning states that currently eating and drinking establishments, restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| are permitted in the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I'm not sure how they're regulated under the alcohol laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:16| I'll leave that to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| Staff has, and I think the Planning Commission has no stake in this other than it was a request from a business owner in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:27| And I live in the city, so when I want to go drink beer, even after these meetings, especially after these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:36| I'll wait to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Have you finished your statement, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| I believe Commissioner Gill, I'm going to do my best to get in the order of the lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| but I know Commissioner Gill, you're the first to light up on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| Because, again, I wish we could just end bringing in the sheaves and the old blue laws associated with what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| I would appreciate that we take a serious look at the standards associated with the county since that's where our growth would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| Our growth is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| And I would appreciate if I lived in that far east-southwest portion of the county to go have a cocktail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6913)|
| 1:55:22| and to stumble to my house within a reasonable distance versus driving all the way into the interior of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:30| and then trying to get all the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| This is about the future growth of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| And we sit here to think that this is not going to impact new businesses that want to be in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| This is, I mean, at this point, you know, since Kmart is going out of business, let's just get a blue light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6943)|
| 1:55:55| I'll refrain from making the Kmart blue light very special joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| But, all right, Commissioner Smith, then Daly, and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| He doesn't have a blue light. He has a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| You're saying that Daly's came on before yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| All right, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| Gerald, who brought this before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| John Huber made the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| There was a business that approached him for locating in the markets of Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| that wanted to have a small brew pub, microbrewery, within the property of the markets of Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:34| I'm going to vote against this for the simple reason that even though it's inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| I get phone calls on a couple of establishments late at night and some of the things that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| If we put this neighborhood commercial that's backed up to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| we're just asking for phone calls to codes, phone calls to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| It's just going to create a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| So, I don't think that it's needed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| It could be in commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| If they want to get around it, they go to the state of Tennessee and get a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| and then they could do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| Without it being permitted in that zone, even a bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| the only thing that's, again, permitted in the neighborhood commercial is restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| which could serve alcohol as part of their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| Yeah, but this is a brewery that could be open to what, 2, 3 o'clock in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:30| Unless the ordinance put restrictions on the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| Which I think the law director says we cannot do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| We can't do it on the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| Are you wrapped up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| Director Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| It's not Commissioner Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7071)|
| 1:57:52| It's Director Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| Director Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| If a micro, is it the production or is it the concept of this place does not want to sell food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7079)|
| 1:58:06| Could you have a microbrewery where you brew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| but you also have a restaurant where you sell food in a neighborhood commercial zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| That would be a decision for codes, but if they're serving food, acting as a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| their primary business is a restaurant and they brew beer on the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| I would say they could locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| The major issue with this one is, in my conversations with Mr. Huber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| was that the business that was interested in locating it in his development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| would be a brewery only with sales of the beer they made but no food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| So it's on-site and off-site, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| And that would depend on their liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| This is going away from the restaurant cocktail dinner concept to more of a strictly bar concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:57| With all due respect, Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| I certainly hope our future is not in the microbrewery industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| that we have better growth than that going forward in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| But I think I'm going to do something that will surprise people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| and agree with Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| that I think there's an intention in these neighborhood commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| and when they were established and these lands and areas were located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| they were not designed for bar-type activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| And I appreciate the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| These ordinance amendments, whether they're from the staff or the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| or in this case from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| to get a feel of what the policy direction should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| and I appreciate the input from the Commission on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| And we're back to Commissioner Jay, then Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| There must be a black hole about to open up in Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| because I absolutely agree with Commissioner Gill on this one once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:59| The markets at Choteau has, I believe it's Casa de Gallo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| which serves beer and liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| And food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| Live music, wine, pretty much everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| We don't hear calls and calls and calls about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| It's a great neighborhood restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| The only difference in this is that it doesn't serve food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| And I've been to cities all across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| and you know what one of the number one things that they say about a growing city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| in almost every study, is if you have a growing city that's thriving and prosperous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7229)|
| 2:00:35| it has a lot of microbreweries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| It has a lot of places that has innovation, has entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| I've been to many of these establishments, and they are great business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| They're not your sort of corner lounge, you know, till 4 in the morning, rowdy bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:52| biker bar kind of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| These are craft brewery, craftsmen and entrepreneurs building businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| selling products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| There's many of these in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| There's one of these right at the bottom of Bearden Hill called a Bridge Beer Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| Now, they serve food, but not that much of a food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| and it's pretty much an on-site brewery that you can take, you can buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| It's literally right next to a church in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| There's lots of examples of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| and I think it's time to sort of evolve a little bit as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| and accept some new businesses that might bring some great commerce to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| and cut down on a little bit of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| the factor that you have to drive to a certain place to get a certain bit of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| So I'd like to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| I'm going to vote against Commissioner Schoonmaker's amendment to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| and I think that we ought to embrace microbreweries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| and the entrepreneurs that bring that to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:47| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Well, I'm going to have to vote with Commissioner Schoonmaker on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| And just the areas that you're referring to, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| is in the city where it's commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| We're pretty much being more out in the rural county around residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| And the Mexican restaurant there in the ñ I mean, that's a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| They serve food, and it's in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| But I think that we're opening ourselves up to a lot of loopholes down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:32| that I personally don't see where a microbrewery is needed in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7352)|
| 2:02:39| And it would be one thing, I mean, if they were making it and you were going in to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| taking it home or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| but the fact that they can go around and get a liquor license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| and open it up to more potential harm is quite a bit different being out in the rural area of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:59| versus being in the city part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| So, I'm going to have to vote with Commissioner Schoonmaker on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| Okay. Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:10| Okay. Yes, go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| I've got a question for Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| Have you had an overly large amount of people contacting you about this specific reading in your district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| I mean, you have one of the most rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| I haven't had anyone contact me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Clarifying yes means no right here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| Yeah, I want to clarify, yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| I was just about to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| So, if you vote yes with Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| the yes vote is a vote against the ordinance that is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| I have a procedural question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| Since this is the only motion on the floor, do we fall back to the agenda motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7438)|
| 2:04:08| Can you repeat that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| Repeat that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| The motion, I apologize, the motion is to deny the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| And so, if the motion passes, the ordinance is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| If the motion fails, you've got to act one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| So, we're back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| Yeah, the item is still before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| You haven't taken action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| All right, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| I have a question for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| If the motion that Commissioner Schoonmaker has given is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:43| does this go back to first reading, or does this go back to zero and start fresh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| It's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| It'll have to go back to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| Can I make a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| I just have one other clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Metropolitan Planning Commission approved this 11-0, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| People that have expert knowledge in planning unanimously voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| They like beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| They're a lot more expert than we are, I guarantee you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| I'm pro-beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| All right, so, once again, it's time for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| We may end up doing a roll call vote on it, because this is likely to be split, reading the tea leaves here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| But all in favor of Commissioner Schoonmaker's amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| and if this passes, that means that this ordinance is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:39| Is that clear enough for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| So, if you vote yes, the ordinance, and if the majority gets it, it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| Is that clear enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| So, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| I heard what it sounded like, two or three votes that were nay, but it did sound as if the ayes had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7554)|
| 2:06:02| Do you need a roll call vote, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Yeah, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| Just roll call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| Or yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| I'm sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7573)|
| 2:06:14| Commissioner Besseler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| Yes means no, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:22| Yes means no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Charlie, I've got to put yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| Commissioner Besseler votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7586)|

| 2:06:28| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Commissioner Beeler passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7591)|

| 2:06:36| Commissioner Jay votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7597)|

| 2:06:41| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Commissioner Gill votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Commissioner Carringer votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| Let's pass wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| What about the rest of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| You haven't gotten to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| I know it's late at night, but don't hurt our feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| The chair votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| Okay, does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| The pass does not wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| The pass is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| 7-3-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| All right, Mr. Schoonmaker's resolution, motion, passes the 7-3-1 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7642)|
| 2:07:33| So the passage means that this ordinance is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7657)|
| 2:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| I'd like to apologize again for speaking passionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7661)|
| 2:07:46| You know, we've worked real hard to make sure everyone's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| and we sometimes don't provide personal messages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| but we do try to make the information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| I just wanted to make it clear that the ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| as drafted and approved by the stakeholder committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| was what went to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| And we appreciate enough that you care that much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| I make mistakes, but when I do make them, I admit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| I don't like to be told I made a mistake when I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| Yeah, we appreciate your passion and that you care so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| All right, Madam Clerk, is there any other items before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| And I want to be clear that we're wrapping up the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| We have to get to one last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| While I'm inclined to try and push through the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| we've only got one item remaining on that rather than taking a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| So is there any other items on the zoning agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| I think we're all done, correct, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| So the zoning meeting is now concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| Now opening us back up into the Board of Commissioners meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| Madam Clerk, if you could please read off the item that we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7732)|
| 2:08:58| It's our first reading of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| All right, if you could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| On page 9, item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| Before we go into that item, I would like to ask you all something and make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7749)|
| 2:09:16| In our rules, we do have the ability to reconsider any motion that has been on our floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| We can bring it back up for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| If one of the persons on the prevailing side agrees to and it's second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| does it have to be second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| It doesn't have to be second, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| You have to have two people from the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Two people from the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| One to break the motion to reconsider, one to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| And then that original issue is back before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:48| And if we can get to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| I would make a substitute motion that I made before on how to go forward with this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7790)|
| 2:09:57| And I'm just putting that out there for everybody because we do have a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| I don't know if this is the appropriate time or not, but as a member of the prevailing side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| I would like to ask the Chair that we reconsider item number 903 for the purpose of further consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7810)|
| 2:10:19| I fully support Commissioner Biggs' intent behind the resolution, and I supported the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| but I was troubled by a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| One was that, based on her comments, Commissioner Gill seemed to support the idea as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7827)|
| 2:10:33| but was unable to support the resolution as it was read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| and also that Commissioner Smith was not able to be heard during the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7837)|
| 2:10:43| and was willing to offer a substitute motion that might have been more acceptable to some members of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| as well as possibly the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| You're the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Based on Commission rules, I'll look to the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| I believe we need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| We need a second from the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| From the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| So is there a second from the prevailing side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| Commissioner Daly, are you the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| We have a first and a second for the record to show that that came from Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| with the second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| Process-wise, this is not something that – is that put it back on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7879)|
| 2:11:20| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| No need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| Just confirming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Have the motion restated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| Yeah, we haven't had a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| A substitute motion asking that the County Mayor and City Mayor, through the KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| study the highest and best use for the area known as East Town Mall and how the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7901)|
| 2:11:48| can assist in its redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| Can I –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7912)|
| 2:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| You wish to make a – that's your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| Do you wish to make any additional statement on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| So that is the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| Is there a second for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| Can I add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| You can suggest a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| Can I suggest a friendly amendment that includes from Exit Ramp 8 to Exit Ramp 8 and over –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| and just draw the boundaries of Washington Park and Millertown Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| And remove the portion that – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| I will – that's what – I will second your motion to do that and not just focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| So if you accept this, I'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Should it not be Knoxville Center Mall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| It's Exit 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Exit Ramps are Exit 8 on each end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| Washington Park and Millertown Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| There's your boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| Is that good, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| Does that boundary sound good to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| I think that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7970)|
| 2:12:51| And that includes all of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| And that includes all the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7974)|
| 2:12:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7975)|
| 2:12:56| Millertown, Washington Park, Exit Ramp, Exit Ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| We're just – we've been just talking right here, but I want to get back to being formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| So Commissioner Smith has made the formal substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| The friendly amendment clarifies – is the second with the friendly amendment that clarifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| the beats and bounds, so to speak, of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| And just so that our clerk's office is very clear on that, would you cleanly, while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| not talking, restate exactly what the beats and bounds are on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| The Exit Ramps – Exit Ramp 8 on eastbound and westbound side, Washington Park and Millertown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8005)|
| 2:13:33| Park are all the boundaries around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| And I think Old Mine Road would be in there, too, but – or Mill Road, but that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| general geographic area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| In the motion, for the folks who are watching this on television, could you spell out exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8028)|
| 2:13:54| what the initials stand for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| The KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| Knoxville Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| Who is our contractor with –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| That probably should be the way it's spelled out in the motion, so there's no –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:09| Knoxville Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| Commissioners can make your lines off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:15| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| We're looking for the study for Knoxville Mall, Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8058)|
| 2:14:26| We're not doing this as a way of trying to – what I'm trying to say is the two mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8066)|
| 2:14:35| may get together, but my first motion to do a study on that mall was to see if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| replace the city county over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| I don't want them to feel that that's what we're doing here is to put that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| so they will take a more clearer look at how we can develop that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| Because if it comes – the original motion came that we were trying to move the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| county employees over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| Now we're saying we're studying it, what's the best use, and if we get a best use out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| of it, we can proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| But we're not trying to in any way – yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8111)|
| 2:15:17| If I might restate what you're saying, Commissioner Bussler, which seems to me you're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| make sure you understand what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| It sounds like the motion is basically to say it's a broader feasibility study of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| region of what would be the highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| Is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| The highest and best use –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| And transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| And transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| To make sure that we look at that to make sure that we're doing the best thing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| Knox County taxpayers with that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8145)|
| 2:15:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Now I want to try to get through the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| Commissioner Beeler and then back to Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| I'm sorry, was Gil before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| My apologies, Commissioner Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| And I appreciate your sentiment, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| We're looking at a more broader macro view of that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8160)|
| 2:16:08| We're not restricting based on the original motion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| We're looking at all the components that will make the highest, best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:19| And a lot of factors are going to be factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| We have one central property, but that does not define that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| And I think that's where we got – we lost some focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| We need an entire look at how we can best approach that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8191)|
| 2:16:37| Because there are lots of businesses that are there, and there are lots of moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| And we just want to make sure we have a comprehensive approach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8202)|
| 2:16:47| Thank you, Commissioner Gil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| And moving on, we've got Commissioner Beeler, then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| I just want to clarify one thing with Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| Your motion didn't say anything about moving the city-county building, did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| We don't own the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| Can you restate the motion real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267191216part2?start=8230)|
