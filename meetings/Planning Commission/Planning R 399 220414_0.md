| 0:17:47| If there is any opposition, they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| I believe we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Okay, this is item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| We've got Ralph Siglin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| Patricia Dodd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| and Kevin Siglin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1088)|
| 0:18:18| Please state your name and address, please, for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| and, again, reminder that a total of five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and so if there's others wishing to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| please be considerate and leave the time available for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| If necessary, we can extend the time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| but try to keep it within that five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Okay, my name is Ralph Siglin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| I live at 518 Broadview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| My house is north of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Now, hopefully you can bring those maps back up when I need them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| because I want to refer to the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Could I ask you to please pull the microphone a little closer to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| If the maps can stay up, I'd like to refer to the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| When I read this over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| what I came out with was a solution looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| That's what I came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| If you look in the, I don't know if you had the reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| but on the plan amendment report, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| it's talking about the need for more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| and number two says there's a limited opportunity for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| residential housing within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| adjacent to existing parks and transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Okay, well, then the problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and how you fix the problem is you say there's errors in the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| which is kind of interesting because we went through this in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| about two years ago, and there was no problem with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| So I'd like to address what I see they say is a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| and I say it's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| All right, the first thing is the description says it's multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| medium residential, general residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| general residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| But if you look at that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| you've left out all the family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Okay, well, let's address the medium residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| which is one plot of land, approximately an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| and when I went back and looked at the aerials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| the farthest I could go back to see the sharp apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| it was there in 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| So I would assume it's already been grandfathered in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| and I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| why are you using one piece of property to rezone four pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| when all around you, you have residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| Another statement, this is both in the amendment and the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| that zoning becomes located, serves a transient between single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| residential neighborhoods north, and commercial nodes to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| Well, let me address the commercial nodes to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| You have, number one, you have a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| Number two, you have a barbershop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Number three, you have a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| And on Bruin Road, you have a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Let's go back and look at the map again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Look at house number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| It's at the bottom of the property being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| That's low density, and that is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| So you're going to plop something in the middle to protect me from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| So what are you going to do for those folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| So to me, it doesn't make any sense to change the zoning based on those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Another thing is they talk about public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| and it says it's 500 feet from the nearest transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| Well, there's a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| The bus goes down at 500 feet, but the nearest bus stop is a quarter mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And then I don't know where they get their numbers for how many students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Like, it's only going to add 12 students to the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Is there some kind of formula that you use to come up with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| seeing we don't really know what's going in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| So how can we come up with how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| My last comment has to do with the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| What has determined that the slope there is less than 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1374)|
| 0:23:05| How do I know, or how do we know it's less than 15% slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| Based on the criteria of the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| Is there a way of getting that question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Ms. Albertson, would you like to respond to Mr. Siglin's comment, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| We actually have a slope map on KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| the resource that we're looking at here that shows the degrees of slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| so you can see that the majority of this property is less than 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| It also doesn't fall within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| What majority of the property is less than 15%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| I think we're trying to pull it up for you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| so you can see that the green area is zero to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| Well, that's on the back of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Look at the front of the property on Bruin Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| because we're talking about 4.6 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| so they're only going to use the back part of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Okay, but if you look at the front of the property, what do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Would the other two parties wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| We left you three seconds, right, 13 seconds, but I'll extend it a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| Please try to keep your remarks as brief as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| and do not repeat what has already been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| My name is Patricia Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| I live at 514 Broadview Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| and my property is adjacent to the property for which the amendment has been applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Patricia Dodd, 514 Broadview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you, Ms. Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| First, I'd like to thank you for your service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| and we appreciate the opportunity to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| In looking at the plan amendment report for the north sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| indicating east for the surrounding land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| and plan designation is the medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| The current zone plan is different from, I guess that is the one-year plan map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1534)|
| 0:25:42| The current zone plan is different in that it shows the listings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| for those properties as low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| According to the sector plan amendment requirements from the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| as I'm sure you all know them, there are no changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| The area was reviewed, and the new coding was accepted by the city council in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1568)|
| 0:26:19| There are no obvious or significant errors or omissions in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1579)|
| 0:26:32| The application for amendment has been denied twice for the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| I'm not sure why, but I would say that it didn't meet the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| There have been no significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| The property was zoned previously for LDR use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| and the zone remained unchanged through the recode Knoxville process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| The current LDR zoning is consistent with the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| the general plan, and the north sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| The zoning was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| The current zone is compatible with the R1 and the R2 land uses in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| The proposed amendment to change the zone from LDR to MDRO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| conflicts with the Knoxville-Knox County general plan and its component parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| including adopted sector plans, corridor plans, and related documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| Should the change to the plans be considered on the basis of its physical location to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| a precedent would be set which would allow any property owner living near a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| in any sector of the city to apply for amendment to the general plan and the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| The property is not a transitional property buffering a residential community from a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| The property is not adjacent to a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Excuse me, Ms. Dodd, if you could wrap up your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| We've allocated an extra two minutes, so if you could just conclude those as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| It is instead buffered by the commercial node by single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| The property is not relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| It is a sloping hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| It has a sloping of 15% to 25% over the majority of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| It is greater than 40% in some areas according to the KGIS map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| The sloping exists on more than half of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| The property can be developed with the current zone, provide housing that is compatible with the existing LDR properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| MDRO is an incompatible use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| The application for amendment to the sector plan is not warranted because it does not meet the location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1733)|
| 0:29:04| Thank you, Ms. Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| I'm sorry, we've run out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| The commission wants to extend additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| Come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Give us your name and address and we'll give an additional two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Mr. Huber, you will have a total of nine minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| Lynn Siglin, 518 Broadview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Your previous decision on the current zoning was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| Right now it allows for 15 houses with 10,000 square feet in each yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| If it were changed to R&2, it would allow for 30 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| So that would allow the owner to get a lot of money from the sale of those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| As was stated, you've got homes on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| 11 houses that will be affected on the one side and the homeowner that's on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1808)|
| 0:30:20| Extend sharp lane from Coster into the property so that you don't have a pileup of traffic on Bruin if you do build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1820)|
| 0:30:30| Build sidewalks, which are very important for the pool and children that are living in the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| Leave a buffer on both sides of the property so that homeowners, like ourselves and the others on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1837)|
| 0:30:46| have a buffer between the houses that are built and the other homeowner would have a buffer too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1846)|
| 0:30:56| So it's affecting 12 immediate homeowners. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you, Ms. Siglin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Mr. Huber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| You have nine minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you. John Huber, P.O. Box 230308 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| Yeah, this property is 4.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| And to address some of the comments that were made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| I don't think the decision was necessarily made because it is just across the street from a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| It's because it's across the street from a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| It's just a few hundred feet away from a pretty major intersection with industrial uses, commercial uses, public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| All of these things combined, not to mention there's been some talk of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| As we know, this is in the city of Knoxville where the hillside protection plan is a shall, not a should, in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1910)|
| 0:32:00| So it severely constrains any development on property that has a slope higher than 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1920)|
| 0:32:08| which as we saw on the KGIS map, there's very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| It looked to me like it was really contained really in the right-of-way of the road, not necessarily on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| So it is relatively flat in those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And given the fact that the city of Knoxville is constraining anything over 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| conversely, it would lead to that you want to put more density on flatter ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| Besides that, we all have seen in Knoxville and Knox County, there's just a huge amount of people moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| Tens of thousands of people are moving here over the next few years, and we're going to have to house them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| We're going to have to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| This is an excellent spot for an infill situation that has strong infrastructure around it, again a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| major commercial intersection, and is already surrounded by medium density, as you can see by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1977)|
| 0:33:05| Those things, I would just respectfully ask that you approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you, Mr. Hueber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Commissioner, first discussion will be on the sector plan amendment to medium density residential slash office, based on staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=1995)|
| 0:33:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Hearing none, Commissioner Ooten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| Yeah, I do feel that that's a very old, established subdivision and community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2016)|
| 0:33:46| So I definitely would understand why there would be some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| At the same time, Bruin Road is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| It's right across the street from a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| It's close to a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| That's really where we want to concentrate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| And so we might not have done this 10 years ago, but I sure think it's a good location today, and I think staff got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| So I would make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Commissioner Smith, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Chair, we have a motion by Commissioner Ooten, seconded by Commissioner Higgins, to amend the sector plan to medium density residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2063)|

| 0:34:43| Next is the amendment to the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| Staff's recommending medium density residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Motion by Commissioner Ooten, seconded by Commissioner Higgins, to approve the one-year plan amendment per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2107)|

| 0:35:09| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Chair, we'll entertain a motion on the rezoning as recommended by staff, RN5, general residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Ooten, seconded by Commissioner Higgins, to approve RN5 general residential neighborhood zoning per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2121)|
| 0:35:31| You've heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2132)|

| 0:35:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Next is agenda item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| This is a rezoning, file 4E22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Applicant is Jerry Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Location, west side of East Governor John Sevier Highway at French Broad intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| Size of track, 17.45 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Present zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Zoning requested, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| Five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Staff recommendation, approved planned residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre because it is compatible with surrounding development and consistent with the sector plan subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2175)|
| 0:36:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Mr. Price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2193)|

| 0:36:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| We do have a number of people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Would you like to go first or would you like opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| I'll let the opposition speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Thank you, Mr. Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Dale Broughton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| We do have several people who are willing to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| Are you representing the group or are you just speaking individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Well, a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| I'm in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| The neighborhood that the petition was signed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| I hope everyone got their copy of the petition that we signed, I hope, I guess, in the package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Did you all get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2241)|

| 0:37:31| Again, your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Dale Wroughton is my name, 4315 French Road, which is a few hundred feet from the location of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2255)|
| 0:37:45| Hopefully you all got the petition and the pictures that we sent in your package or Ms. Hillman sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2265)|
| 0:37:55| And I appreciate her doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| Let me get to my page here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| The staff recommendations on this, of course, you all are very familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| I don't know if he quoted that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| It was three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| And if you're comparing it, of course, to our neighborhoods, and I wrote that on the – and you've got a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| The neighborhoods, all the homes in there, the pictures of the homes, and they range anywhere probably from half a million to a little over a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| So we're just concerned about the devaluation of our homes in a sector of this congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| She compared – the staff made the recommendation of from five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| And in reading that, and it was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| I appreciate what she'd done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| There's a lot of things for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| The accidents – my wife told the call right there at the intersection where you pulled out where this property is located, so I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| There's a huge curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| It's 90 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| It's from due east to due south, and it's about a 400-foot guardrail where this property – right adjacent to where this property is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| And it's very dangerous compared to what they compared it to with Syringe River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| which is about, I don't know, 600 or 800 feet up the road on Johnsonville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Syringe River is this lady, and we've talked to her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| It's a great neighborhood, and we appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| The recommendations from y'all – and I'll repeat this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| You can see it, of course – was that from five units, which would be 87 units on 17.5 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| comparing that to the nearby residential subdivision of Syringe River, which has got only 45 units on 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2375)|
| 0:39:44| So it's one and a half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| They said considering this precedence that that's where you came up with the three units per acre was the Syringe River condo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2388)|
| 0:39:57| which is just a few hundred feet down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| Well, when I looked up what precedence means, because I'm not – I can't hardly pronounce it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2400)|
| 0:40:09| I was trying to decide, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| I mean, why would you decide that on this density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| And when I looked at it, it is something that perceives or actually has been done before, like that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2415)|
| 0:40:23| Therefore, the precedent in this model is the model or example or standard for this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| And I think that's what she's saying and what I understood it to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| but the density of this three units per acre proposal is twice the density of Syringe River that you're comparing it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2433)|
| 0:40:44| So you've got 45 units on Syringe River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| At 45 acres, you've got – I mean, 30 acres, you've got 45 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| This is 17 acres, 17.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| They wanted to put over 50 even on the three-unit recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| So all the residents that I've talked to in Syringe River and anywhere else have got a problem with the value of their homes going down, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2457)|
| 0:41:08| The complaint that they had is their lots were too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| At one-and-a-half acre, they wanted a larger lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| So if this truly is the precedence that you're taking, how can that be that you're doubling the density just a few hundred feet down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2477)|
| 0:41:31| I do not understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| None of the residents of either subdivision I've talked to, and I've talked to everyone I've ever talked to, 100 percent of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| he may have one, I don't know if Jerry does or not, does not want this density subdivision because this is our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| This is community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| I know the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| There is no neighborhood close by that has this kind of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| What this is going to do is set the precedence for the future with the property we own and sell maybe one day as a farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| other people own as a farm, of trying to get three-units breaker everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| And they can because this will be the precedent at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| It's not now because even though y'all recommended it several years ago up to three-units, these people built one-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2529)|
| 0:42:18| And we admire them for that, thank them for that, and we sure don't need to give that precedence up because of a recommendation of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| We want to cut that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| We love the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| We like the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| As far as comparing the pieces of property, the Salinity River does not have a flood problem that this property has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| It's a lower elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| It's got more slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| It's closer to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| You've got to watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| You've got to watch the perk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Ten percent slope going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Water there standing all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| The person there right next door, of course, a lot of these people can't be here that signed the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| I had two or three other pages I didn't get on the Internet because, you know, well, they said the main thing was just get the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| I'm sure you got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Mr. Rotton, I apologize, but your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Can you wrap up your comments, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| The last statement is this, that therefore all the residents and neighborhood developments with custom-built homes agree that a density of one-and-a-half per acre is the actual presence that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2590)|
| 0:43:21| And we urge you to please consider the same density that's in our neighborhood now and don't tear up this neighborhood and put high-density homes in it that they have none there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2601)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Tony Brooks or Dale Brooks, is there anything that has not been said that you would like to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| Tony Brooks, and I'll leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| You name and address, and we'll extend another two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| Please watch the time above me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| My name is Tony Brooks, and I live at 1924 East Governor John Seville Highway, which is just adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| And I have lived there for about 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| And that property, I mean, three houses is adequate for this property, not counting when all these people move in there, they're going to have children that's going to be stopping right there after that curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2650)|
| 0:44:27| if you'll see up there on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| And that will create a hazard to the school buses because right now on John Seville Highway, you have two lanes and a turning lane in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2669)|
| 0:44:38| And that's all the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| It's no shoulder on that road right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| And their entrance to this property will be right across from my driveway, which will cause a hazard for me of getting out of my driveway going right or left because of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2683)|
| 0:44:58| And if you have a school bus out there letting children off out of that curb, you're going to have a problem because of the – if you come out of that curb up there, it's a right-hand curb and it's very steep and very sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2698)|
| 0:45:13| And when you come out, you only have probably about maybe 50, 60 feet where you could stop if there's a school bus there that's got the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2713)|
| 0:45:24| And I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| We should have to afford 90 houses on this property, which will really, really add to the congestion on John Seville Highway, which we had a survey done on that quite a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2726)|
| 0:45:40| And it was 10,000 vehicles come across that highway every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| And that was probably 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| And now that the industrial park and all that is built up, you're going to have more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| And I just don't want to see all these accidents that I perceive coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| And you have people coming off of French Road also right at the corner of that property, and plus my driveway, plus all the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2767)|
| 0:46:16| If it's a four-lane highway with a turning lane in the middle, different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| But still, yeah, I don't think that property could hold five houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you, Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Time is up. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| Mr. Rackley, I want to give you seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| Dale Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| My wife, my mother-in-law has some medical problems, and she won't be able to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Janice Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Ms. Pritchett, again, we'll allow two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| But please be aware of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| We've got a large agenda tonight today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| We don't want to be here until midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| My name is Janice Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| I live at 1918 Serenity Cove Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2830)|
| 0:47:18| As others have spoken about the density of this proposed housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2838)|
| 0:47:29| on 17 1⁄2 acres compared to the closest subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| which is actually 37.2 acres with 47 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2856)|
| 0:47:44| You'll hear differing numbers, but that's the subdivision I happen to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| I think five dwellings is not compatible with the current density in use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| which is currently low-density residential agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| not against the planned residential, just advocating for a lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| I appreciate that the planning staff recommended three dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| but if you compare the 37 acres with 47 houses to half of the acreage size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| which is on waterfront, which has a floodplain issue, floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2906)|
| 0:48:37| It also has some stream protection on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| The current neighborhoods are rural, detached residential, vacant land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| floodway, and agricultural with Knox-Chapman Utility District nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2930)|
| 0:49:00| So I'm asking the commission to respect the rural agricultural low-density nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| of the surrounding area and consider a 1 1⁄2 to 2.4 dwellings per acre on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2947)|
| 0:49:21| I understand there also may be an easement issue on the property just down the road from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| Ms. Pritchett, I apologize, but your two minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| Anything you'd like to conclude real quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Well, I just would like to say down the road from us is an industrial park and a quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| The quarry takes up immense amount of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| The industrial park takes expanse of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| I'm just asking for the commission to consider keeping low-density to preserve green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| and not overdevelop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you, Ms. Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Mr. Rackley, you're allocated nine minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Russ Rackley, Rackley Engineering, PO Box 30456 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| The application is for PR up to five units an acre, which meets the definition of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| This sector plan designation of low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| I just want to clarify that from anything up to five units an acre is considered in Knox County low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| This site meets all of the requirements of every plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| It meets the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| It's in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| It meets the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| It's low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| The sector plan was last updated in 2013, and it was still low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| Even if you take the should and not shall of the hillside protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| the staff's slope analysis yielded 4.85 dwelling units an acre as appropriate for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3062)|
| 0:51:11| The site's fully supported by existing utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Knox Chapman Utility District has water and sewer lines on site in capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| We've spoken to them last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| KEB has gas and electric service on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| And it's accessed by State Route 168, which is a TDOT-owned three-lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| meaning one lane each direction plus a continuous center turn lane classified as a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3090)|
| 0:51:38| About the issue of traffic and site distance and stuff like that, being that it's a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| any access for any driveway, whether for a single house or a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| has to be permitted through TDOT's driveway access permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| They will dictate where it goes and how it's constructed, whether there's left-turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| some sort of vehicle control, A-cell, D-cell lanes such as that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| which will be based on a concept plan of traffic counts in conjunction with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| Obviously, site distance requirements have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| That's a prerequisite, but that comes at the design engineering stage and not at the zoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| This site in particular has very few physical constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| There was an error that Ms. Brooks corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| The staff summary originally said that 20 percent of the property was in the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| It is not. Only 0.8 percent of the property is in the floodway, the FEMA regulatory floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| They were confusing the stream protection overlay of the sector plan with that same hatching on a FEMA map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| The stream protection overlay on the sector plan simply states it recommends plain residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| so that a concept plan will have to come back to this body to make sure that any design constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| addressing the natural streams and waterways are met, which we agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| and that's why we're asking for plain residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| The 100-year floodplain is constrained primarily to the shoreline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| There's a little bit that comes up on the neighboring property where they have dammed up a small duck pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| There is quite a bit of the 500-year floodplain on the property that generally is mitigated through county ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| that it's not as significant of a concern as the 100-year since it is, in fact, the 0.01 percent chance occurrence rain event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3201)|
| 0:53:31| We feel like this is a good place for transitional use, being that directly across the 700-foot fetch from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3211)|
| 0:53:41| the 700-foot wide section of stream, is an active rock quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| When you stand on site, you can hear backup alarms on the heavy equipment on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3227)|
| 0:53:56| To the north of this property is a church that owns quite a bit of property that has a sector plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| Civic Institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Across the street from that is the Veterans Cemetery, which is, although not a commercial use, is somewhat of a traffic generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| To the south of this property, along with Serenity Cove, which is zone PR3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| is the Knox Chapman Utility District Wastewater Treatment Plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| Then across the street to the east is all the area that the sector plan had designated as rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| So not planned growth, not eligible for PR zoning, but to be rural and to be left rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| In fact, the entire corridor, the entire Governor John Swearer Highway corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| the areas that are not ridge or hillside that are along that corridor are sector plan of LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| There are at least five or six planned residential zonings at PR up to five and some at PR1 to eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| that are surrounded by property zoned agriculture or zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| But these are properties that front on this major arterial, State Route 168, or as we call it, Governor John Swearer Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3305)|
| 0:55:14| Regarding precedence, I've never been one to try to put a square peg in a round hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3314)|
| 0:55:24| Those of you that have seen me up here lots of times and to the like of me, I thought this was actually a round peg in a round hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| because it meets all the planning requirements for PR up to five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| The only other property in this area that has a sector designation of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3339)|
| 0:55:46| that has taken advantage of it by rezoning and developing was Serenity Cove, and it was rezoned for PR3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| That property is at its closest point 900 feet from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| By road, it's twice as far away to drive there from the rock quarry, it's twice as far away as this subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3362)|
| 0:56:12| Directly across the river from Serenity Cove is not the rock quarry, it is warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3372)|
| 0:56:21| Certainly they can hear some of the rock quarry from there, I would imagine, but it is warehousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| We won't get into the numbers. Per the final plot of Serenity Cove, it was actually 28.85 acres and 49 buildable lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| Not all the lots are built on there, but there are lots owned in there that aren't legal lots that can be constructed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| but that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| At the end of the day, we also know that there is a very drastic need for housing and housing options in Knox County now and moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3403)|
| 0:56:54| Part of the reason for pricing house prices where they are is because the demand is much higher than the supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| If we have a piece of property that is minimally constrained by physical constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| meets all of the planning plans from the growth plan to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| for a zoning of the higher end of the low density residential applicable zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| has all the utilities and fronts on a major artery and we don't take advantage of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| and use it to its highest and best use to provide housing for Knox County, then I really don't know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| We really need to take properties that are conducive to PR up to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| or even the slope analysis plan that said 4.85 units an acre, that would be acceptable to us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3461)|
| 0:57:50| With that, I'll yield the rest of my time and be happy to answer anybody's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| Thank you, Mr. Rackley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Commission, you all heard the comments from the applicant and the opposition and the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| Any discussion? Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| I have a question for Mr. Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Are you planning on building in the 500-year floodplain area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| No, not the entirety of it, meaning it can be relocated with grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| It's based on an elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| The 500-year, not the 100-year, but the 500-year, I think, and Aaron can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| but you can fill halfway between the regulatory floodway and the 100-year boundary without having to do a FEMA map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| The predominance of the 500-year reaches into the property where there's two small ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| with a couple of driveways with culverts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| Our intent is to utilize those, probably redo the outlet structures on them to have them function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| as our detention ponds for the development and our water quality for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3539)|
| 0:59:09| It looked like you looked at Serenity Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Those lots that they did develop, was that because they were in the stream protection area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| No, it's not my belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| Thinking back, the original developers of that, because that property, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| wasn't that sold to, didn't the bank take that over and then auction it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Because when it went in originally, it was way out there as far as the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| At that time, this was back in the mid to early 2000s, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| But no, it has similar constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| It's got a large draw that comes up into it that is in that stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| But let's be clear, that SP overlay on the sector plan, when you read through the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| what does SP overlay mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| What's the recommendation for SP overlay areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| It says we recommend PR or PC, planned residential, planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| That's all the SP means is we recommend a planned zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| so that a concept plan or use on review has to come back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| so that you can address how are they dealing with these issues around the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| Which, again, are engineering things that get handled at concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| and then ultimately working with county engineering on design permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| I feel like I've got water in my ear and it's hard to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| Anyway, I'm fairly familiar with John Speer Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| And looking at today's agenda, we have, I think, three projects on John Speer Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| which means John Speer Highway is being recognized as probably the next potential area to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3661)|
| 1:01:19| Also, I'm familiar with the large houses I've worked out there that are across the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3679)|
| 1:01:32| They're not on the same side of the highway as this project would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| They are large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| They are nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| But change is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| I don't think that the change should come at five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| I think that staff has it exactly right at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| And as far as the comparison to the one-and-a-half acres subdivision, that's enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3718)|
| 1:02:10| That's walled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| It's private in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| It's a gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| You can't hardly tell it when you go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| I think that three to the acre at this time is the appropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3743)|
| 1:02:31| And I'd make a motion that we approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you, Mr. Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins, and then we'll get Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| Just for what it's worth, I know there's a motion on the table right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| but a little bit of echo to what Commissioner Graf said about John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| It does appear to be growing, major arterial road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| I would personally be in favor of even higher density on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| and would like to see more in line with townhouses and more development like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| because this is going to continue to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| and there's going to be more and more people and more vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| So I think that if you all were able to do a development that preserved more green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| and consolidated the dwelling units to a certain part of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| I think that would be a really good way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| I don't know if anyone else feels that higher density might be appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| but I personally do think that higher density could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| I agree with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| I think this is a perfect opportunity to go with the higher density as it fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3836)|
| 1:04:03| Given our current state of the housing market, I think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| If we can do it, we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| So I'd be in favor of the higher density as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| Plus the slope analysis even came up with 4.85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| So I think 5 is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Yeah, I'm probably going to vote against this motion just because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| when I look at this property, if you can't do five units an acre here in the LDR sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| I don't know where you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| It's a pancake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| It's on a three-lane road, major highway, right next to a major employment center in the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| And the highway offers and the river offers a natural buffer by the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| to protect these larger estates that are on the other side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| I don't think it's going to have any effect on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Utilities are right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| There's a utility plant two tracks over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| And, you know, I think we have to be smart and efficient with the way we use our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| You know, we have everybody complain, Hardin Valley, we get all the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| I mean, we need to allow people to live out here too, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| And if we can take care of two more homeowners per acre by one with four to four and a half to five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3924)|
| 1:05:33| I think it's smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| Seeing no other comments, we do have a motion by Commissioner Graf, second by Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| to approve PR plan residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre per stash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=3945)|

| 1:06:43| Chair, we'll entertain an alternate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| I'd like to make a motion that we approve at the slope analysis density of 4.85 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4006)|

| 1:10:14| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Next is agenda item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| This is a sector plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| File 4I22RZ and 4C22SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| Applicant is Southern Homes and Farms, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| Location, west side of Brakeville Road, southwest of Asheville Highway, north of Palmer Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| Tract is 4.22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Present plan designation zoning is low density residential, low density RA, low density residential and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4242)|
| 1:10:51| Proposed plan designation is medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Zoning requested plan residential proposed at 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| Staff recommendation, deny MDR because none of the conditions for a sector plan amendment have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| Second recommendation, approve PR plan residential zoning up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| because it allows for additional residential development within the LDR low density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| The applicant is present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| Mark Underwood, 524 South Carter School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| Mr. Underwood, we're not showing anyone signed up to oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| Is there opposition to the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Seeing none, Mr. Underwood, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| I'd like to make that my first notice that there is no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| I'm a life resident of Knox County, East Knox County, and developed three properties prior to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4308)|
| 1:11:58| Trentville Creekside, Trentville Ridge, and then Trentville Villas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| And Trentville Villas was one of the first environmentally friendly developments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| We used rain gardens for our storm water, so we're very proud of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4328)|
| 1:12:17| and we've been doing it for many generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| We built a townhouse development, which mostly has been acquired by local residents who are downsizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4343)|
| 1:12:34| needing something, so we've hit that market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| That's what we propose to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| This particular property, as you can see, I believe that's about 400 feet by 75 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4363)|
| 1:12:51| before I can even get to a building site on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4371)|
| 1:13:01| And just up the road, there's a 100-acre development with nine per acre that's been approved on for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4381)|
| 1:13:11| This property is also adjacent to the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| and backs up to or adjoins on that north side an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4396)|
| 1:13:26| It's also in part of the growth plan as urban growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| so what we would like to request is at least up to seven houses per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4411)|
| 1:13:40| and submit our concept plan and be reduced from that if the concept plan is not fitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4420)|
| 1:13:54| About three-quarters of an acre is in that first entrance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and the footprints of what would be proposed on our concept plan would also take up about three-quarters of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| so out of 4.2, I'd like to have seven per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| So that's my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Thank you, Mr. Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Similar to the previous one that was on John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| but I think that I don't know how to go about making a motion that opposes staff's recommendation when it comes to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4474)|
| 1:14:47| but I think that higher density is also appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| We're within walking distance of a grocery store, a major road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| I think that I was trying to pull up the bus lines in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| but because this is so close to the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| I think that there's opportunity for public transit stops in the area, especially as it develops more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| So in this case as well, I think that a higher density would be appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Ms. Albertson, in order to go with seven units per acre, that would require a medium-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| So if the commission does feel that medium-density residential is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| you'll need to modify the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| You'll need to give documentation as to the reasoning to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| You've heard staff's recommendation to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| because it currently does not meet any of the conditions for sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4552)|
| 1:16:02| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| With that staff, would you consider that potentially changes in population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| increases in population would justify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| Excuse me, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| I think that's a million-dollar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Well, I see on Breakville, I know that there's been considerable development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| if I'm not mistaken, on Breakville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Subdivisions, would it be shifting population, increased population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4588)|
| 1:16:35| There haven't been any real changes to infrastructure in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4595)|
| 1:16:41| and that's primarily what staff was basing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Speak up a little clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Sorry, there haven't been any changes, any major changes to infrastructure in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| so that was primarily what staff was basing our decision on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| So population could be a justification, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Commissioner Hill, you all could make that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Well, I'm willing to take a shot at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| So I would make a motion for MDR based on population change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| Can you make that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Is there a second before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Second by Commissioner Higgins, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Chair recognizes Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| So there's, it's kind of odd because of how city zoning is adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| but there's RN-5 right to the north that used to be MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| so do we know why that was changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| In the last sector plan update for the East County sector, that MDR area was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4657)|
| 1:17:44| I tried to find some evidence of why that may have been removed during that planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4664)|
| 1:17:51| but I couldn't find a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| Sometimes, you know, the community has to change things on the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| and sometimes it does change and sometimes it doesn't, so that may have been something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| If it would have been MDR, then this would have been an extension of the sector plan essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| So I would support MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| Yeah, I think that in looking at this, breakable again is a minor collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| maybe even a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Got the commercial node, and I would bet that the piece to the north is contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| that got built out at five for the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| It's probably limited in the fact that there's hillside protection on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| that probably would have allowed it to develop even higher if that hillside wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| So I think we would find comfort in that, being contiguous to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| so I would support Commissioner Hill's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Commissioner Scott-Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| He's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| So we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| to approve MDR, the sector plan amendment based on the population growth of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4739)|
| 1:19:08| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Do we have any information regarding population growth in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| Before we make a decision based on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| Commissioner, staff does not have any information to offer at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| on the population growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| So I guess at this point it's totally anecdotal, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I'm not sure even specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Does it say growth or change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| Population change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Yeah, I understand what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| I just want to make sure there is actually change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| I'm not as familiar with that area as I probably should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| but I just want to make sure when we do sector plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| that we do provide the right legitimate justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| I mean, this is a 4.2-acre property, and so we're two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| We're talking about eight units difference here between what he could do with LDR and MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| I would be supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Is it really changing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| We had that nine-for-the-acre at the other end of the break pool not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| So there definitely has been a change in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| I think there's utility improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| We were required to have road improvements, widen the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| do off-site sidewalks as a part of that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| So I definitely think when you put change in conditions into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| it will make everybody feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| We actually have had some information from realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| The population is changing all over Knox County and in the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| People are moving here in droves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| So, I mean, I think you could use that as evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| and also anecdotal evidence from homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| People are just coming here right and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4870)|

| 1:21:20| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Commissioner Haley, your line is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| No, I put it on intentionally because if it puts more people at ease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| and we use the change of conditions rather than change of population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| you know, I'd be willing to say change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Maybe it could be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| But since we don't have the numbers of population, it's change of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| So you heard Commissioner Hill's comments on the changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=4902)|

| 1:29:35| This matter is very similar to the previous one, so luckily you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| have to hear the positions of support twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| We're asking that you approve staff recommendation on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| to the sector plan from the general commercial designation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| medium density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| As noted in the staff report, you have a substantially large commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| node there that is only continuing to expand each year since especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| This property backs up immediately to the Lowe's that's out there, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| you're familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Interesting enough is that the Lowe's and the property adjacent to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| one, that that is in fact the Knoxville city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| So when you're considering the density requested, I think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| important to consider that in relation to it also being adjacent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| As the South County sector plan notes that the medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| plan designation is designed to serve as a kind of a transitional land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5444)|

| 1:31:01| We see that on most of the county sector plans, whether it's office or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| medium density multifamily type of step down from a highly intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| commercial development that has substantially more traffic to then an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| office, an apartment that has less, eventually to a lower density to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5476)|

| 1:31:24| We've met with the South Door Community Association on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| I believe it was last week and kind of told them what the proposal was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| ultimately or the hope, the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| They had some questions and submitted some comments in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| A lot of it has to do with traffic initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| I guess I would point out that obviously we'll have to do a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| impact study that Governor John Severs has controlled by TDOT, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| is currently designated as general commercial and then general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| I would submit that this downward plan designation request as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| the downward rezoning request, that traffic is going to be substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| less than anything that could go there about right as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| I know I've been to that Lowe's area several times and there is traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| constantly coming in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| So I would submit that although people assume multifamily has a high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| concentration of traffic, that it would in fact be substantially less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| As for the rezoning, I submit that that is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| There is a planned residential immediately across the street from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| that also has an MDR designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| As Commissioner Graff pointed out, this area of Knoxville has got on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| radar and it's important that we take these larger tracks that are next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5564)|
| 1:32:52| these commercial nodes and for residential, that we maximize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| density opportunity on those parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| I submit that this is a good request as far as the increase for the above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5577)|
| 1:33:04| 12 but less than 24, so up to 23 density that you can have an MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| To have that, and we satisfy those, is you're next to mass transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| So we're within a quarter of a mile to a CAT bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| What else has to be either there or will be there is pedestrian connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| and my client, the developer, is agreeable to make that pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| connection as is agreeable to the other conditions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| This property, if you've seen it, there's a large kind of embankment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| along John Sevier there with mature trees and if you've accessed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| property, it's pretty neat that it kind of drops in there and flattens off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| So concerns about scenic highway there on Governor John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| A lot of this, from a visual barrier, is going to have a barrier and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| shield it from the traffic along John Sevier and some of the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| parcels based on the size of that embankment with the mature tree buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| The development exhibit would fall back in there and then lays out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| towards the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Again, request that you follow staff recommendation, approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| section plan amendment as well as rezone the property PR up to 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5658)|

| 1:34:31| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| How's the volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| You're good, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5675)|

| 1:34:41| I am a member of the South Doyle Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| We do appreciate the developers having met with us last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| I imagine they were hoping for a warmer reception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| I think some of our members had a case of indigestion that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| But traffic is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| Traffic along John Sevier has been a concern for a long time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| improvements to the road are a long way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| But we do realize that the traffic study would be done at a subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| stage in the proceedings, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| But we did submit written comments, and I won't repeat those, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| do want to elaborate a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| We do feel that there is not conditions met for the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| change, but I understand how the commission feels about those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| so I assume you will approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| So aside from the traffic, one of our other concerns, the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| shared an initial plan drawing with us, which I don't know if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| And one of our members is Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| He used to be the 9th District County Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| And he gets right to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| So what we saw in the drawing was basically it's a sea of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| It looked to me like it was absolutely packed to the maximum allowable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| density, 10 buildings, over 500 parking spaces, maybe over 600 parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| There was one dog park, a small dog park, I think was about the size of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| this floor area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| There was a swimming pool to the far east side next to the Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| But other than that, it was asphalt and buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| And former Commissioner Brown raised his hand, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| I see your dog park, but where's the people park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| What are the people going to do here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| There's going to be kids here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Where are the kids going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| And so to me the emphasis, I realize that if you do approve PR zoning, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5802)|

| 1:37:29| lot of opportunity here to combine protection of the scenic highway with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5849)|

| 1:37:44| would urge them to take that into account when they come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=5864)|

| 1:40:04| Yeah, I have a question about the tree buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| Is that from engineering, or is that just a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6009)|
| 1:40:16| Which tree buffer are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Condition number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6018)|

| 1:40:37| It's probably not a big deal, but as much as I appreciate the aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| being maintained at John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| I do think that allowing the development to engage with the highway without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6046)|
| 1:40:51| creating too big of a buffer would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6051)|

| 1:44:50| five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6290)|

| 1:45:13| In fact, when that came through planning commission, even county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6313)|

| 1:45:31| When the engineering plans get prepared, drafted, reviewed, finalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| generally that density is substantially less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| Part of what the staff report provides is to why they only recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6341)|
| 1:45:49| a density of up to two dwelling units per acre is because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| The growth policy plan has been debated for several years here on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| several developments, especially out in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| I don't think it's disagreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| In fact, it's probably not acknowledged that the growth policy plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| quite outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| There's been discussions of its validity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Regardless of that, the reason for the up to two dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| acre is because of the growth policy plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| This property is in the rural area, whereas the one that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| immediately adjacent to us is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| That was something that was created many years, 10, 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| That was designated at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Still is not the case, especially when you factor in these recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| developments that have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| The growth policy plan says you can get up to two dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| acre for property in the rural area unless, and those are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| exception, unless you meet certain conditions, which include sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| utilities, collector streets, and a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| It's our position we should not be limited to the two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| per acre when we have all of these, meet all these exceptions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| conditions to allow a density increase of up to three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| In fact, we're requesting less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Given the fact that we have a large parcel of property, a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| track, it makes sense from a development standpoint that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| utilize these larger parcels to create responsible, moderately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| dense developments versus taking the smaller parcels and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| cut those up with multiple access points, multiple developments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| are not part of one development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| This lowers the impact on the surrounding properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| Again, we request that right on time that you amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6463)|
| 1:47:49| from ag to low-density residential, approve a rezoning, plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| residential up to 2.9 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| I believe the Planning Commission is well aware of the housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| and understands, based on the review of the 2022 State of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| report that was prepared by the Knoxville Area Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6489)|

| 1:48:20| Yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| Are you speaking on behalf of the citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Are you speaking on behalf of yourself or the others in the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6504)|

| 1:48:40| Yes, Mr. Smith is recusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I was going to mention that here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| If you could pull the microphone a little closer to you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6524)|

| 1:48:54| Thank you, commissioners and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| I represent Gibbs Planning Advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| We request that the commission would deny zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| and deny a sector plan amendment to keep one unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| with areas designated to conserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| Two major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Number one, the concentration of development in a very small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| We acknowledge the road improvements in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| but Thompson School Road is still a small rural road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| The traffic study done for this development at 3.2 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| or 300 new houses estimates this will add over 2,700 trips daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| Is that with one car per house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Does this study take into consideration recently approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| and in process of being built Thompson Meadows, which is 189 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| Woodbury Crossing, 79 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Using the KGIS map tools to roughly measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| this is 568 new homes in an area approximately 3.84 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| And then if you travel 1.5 miles southeast as the crow flies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| Irwin Farm Subdivision has been approved for 70 more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| That is 638 lots approved and that is on, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| and additionally 143 lots have been approved on Tazewell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| north of the crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| This will stress already heavily traveled roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| My question is, are traffic studies cumulative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| The crossroads in the school pickup is a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| The student pickup at the elementary school right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| extends out to the middle of Tazewell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| some days down to the crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| What will happen in five years with 600 new homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| and new developments requesting to be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| We are looking forward to our crossover from the high school to the middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| but that is not going to eliminate traffic on Tazewell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| One option Knox County traffic has suggested is a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| to cul-de-sac Karnes Road and build sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| Unless parents allow their children to walk, which is unlikely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| this will only eliminate parents entering the school zone from the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| adding more traffic to the crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| The traffic concerns of the constituents are overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| Concern number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Issues from this development threaten the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| This property is more than 50% covered with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| It has a significant tree canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| that extends well past the property's boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| The Knoxville-Knox County Tree Conservation and Planning Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| states that protecting and increasing the tree canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| is the central focus of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| The Gibbs community asks that you adhere to your own standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Page 53 states the forested areas of Knox County are diminishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| There are fewer trees remaining, resulting in air quality degradation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| The removal of forest canopy also exacts real costs upon infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| including stormwater facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6703)|

| 1:51:49| Besides, it is just plain common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| On page 47 of the plan, it shows a rendering of the conservation subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6712)|

| 1:52:07| This property is perfect for this kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| This property and the surrounding area is designated as farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6731)|

| 1:52:20| what is considered prime farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| stating the obvious, no society can survive without farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| We would like to see our farmland property owners more educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| about protecting their property and not being forced to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6750)|

| 1:52:53| This property is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6773)|

| 1:53:04| Where will this water go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| To overdevelop this property will have severe repercussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6786)|

| 1:53:25| and maintain the region's rural character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| particularly in the Corryton area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| It also discusses losing farmland to residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| and its repercussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| I implore you to deny Zoning Change and Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| and protect this unique environment of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Thank you very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Thank you, Ms. Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6825)|
| 1:53:54| Again, Commissioner Smith is recusing himself on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| Any comments from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| I heard the remarks from the public as well as the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| Commissioner Ooten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| Yeah, I'd like to go ahead and deal with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6850)|
| 1:54:21| A lot of times over the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| when we're dealing with new residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| that's in that lower end of the low-density range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| and if you have an opportunity to develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| in a rural residential sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| I think it protects properties going out further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| when you get into those rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| And it sounds like this would also meet the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| for that 2, 2.5, 2.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| I'm not going to make a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| But the rural residential would accommodate that type of a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| based on I know there's new sewer and new road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| and this is on a major or a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| Actually, it's a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| So I'd like to make a motion that we deny the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| to the rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| It's rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Sorry, rural residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| No, the plan amendment is to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| Oh, OK, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| It's currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| LDR, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Do rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Approve rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| So is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| Commissioner Graf, we can catch your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| If we approve rural residential, can we still go to 2.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6944)|
| 1:55:51| Or are we locked in at 2.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| Mr. Albertson, are we locked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Is the commission locked in at no more than 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| with rural residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| I think that they can choose to go above that if they so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| But the sort of design currently of these land use designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| has a limit of, I think, up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| But the growth plan actually recommends up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| That's what I'll remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| We have done up to three in rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| in Hardin Valley, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| So that's why I'm making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| We do have a motion on the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| to rural residential and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7001)|

| 1:58:00| Present plan is public parks and refuges and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| And the zoning designation is parks and open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| and floodplain overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7090)|

| 1:58:21| to C1, civic, institutional, and stream protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| because it is consistent with the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| and addresses an error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7108)|

| 1:58:51| the existing use into conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7131)|

| 1:58:59| Mr. Berry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| I am Chip Berry, Deputy Chief of Operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| for the City of Knoxville, 400 Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| We are requesting to, as indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| to rezone the property from open space to institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| Currently, this site is used as Safety City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| which was built many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| If we want to renovate that site and do any other improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| to the property, it doesn't fit under that zoning anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| It fits under institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Additionally, on the back of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| at the end of the access road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| we are looking to propose a new KPD K-9 facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| and a K-9 facility doesn't fit in open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| or most zonings, but under institutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| it would fit as a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| So we appreciate your support of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| Thank you, Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| Is there any opposition to the request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Seeing none, Chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7197)|

| 2:03:50| for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner, I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| So I'm assuming with the R and 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| you're planning on some apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| My concern just in looking that lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| is that there would be only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| I mean, you would think we'd need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| a second access point out of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| and where were you proposing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| So right now we are proposing just a single access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| and that's based on the amount of dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| that we'd be looking at doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| And that would be allowed under engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7463)|
| 2:04:28| It would have to be approved through the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| So if they deem a second exit would be required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| we would work with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| Because it looked like there was like a closed drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| That wouldn't be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| There is potential opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| and our client has actually started conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| with that property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| if that deems necessary by the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| I'd make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7504)|

| 2:05:11| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| Just a quick question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| I noticed that it has filter protection included in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| but it looks like it's been degraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| How will that come into effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| Yes, I believe this would fall under the exemptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| of being a previously disturbed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| So it'll stay as unrelated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| it wouldn't be as same restrictions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| So we have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7539)|

| 2:09:15| We do have one person that's opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| We'll have the opposition first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7761)|
| 2:09:27| For the record, please state your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| Nathan Ellis, and my address is 0 Mississippi Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| So I guess the clock's starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| my first question is not what I showed up here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| I did see 0 Mississippi Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| and I'm assuming that since that's the same address as mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| it's just a different lot number as I'm looking at the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| And so just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| is it the little red hatch marks over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| on the top left side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| that's the 0 Mississippi Avenue address in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| This is a question, not a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| Luz, you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| Yeah? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| All right, so that's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| this is my first time showing up to one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| and I think I've learned a lot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7827)|
| 2:10:34| It appears as though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| any room for passion or ethics does not have room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| This is a logical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| economical decision-making criteria is what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| I'm building a little lot on Mississippi Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| or building a home on a lot there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| and in my short time just visiting a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| I have seen several children, families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| spending time at this park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| and I can only imagine it would be devastating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| to lose something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| or lose access to something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| The only park that's nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| doesn't even really work for playing catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| You go up Nolan Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| there's just this itty-bitty little thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| or maybe it's off Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Anyways, it's about the size of a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| that any of these other houses is on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| not really a park to speak of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| I'd be really interested in seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| the rest of Knoxville College developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| I'd be interested in seeing that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| but as far as the impact it'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| on the denizens of this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7911)|
| 2:11:54| it could be devastating for several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| I have heard people pose the threat of flooded homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7920)|
| 2:12:05| and that didn't really seem to move the needle much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| so a father and a son enjoying time catching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| catching a football, tossing a football around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| probably won't move the needle either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| but I just, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| I'm here to just ask if you will reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| taking this from public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| and especially not adding in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| some medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| that would likely reduce the value of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| unless there's a case to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| that could suggest that there will still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| some public space available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| or that it will, in fact, increase home value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| for those who currently live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Thank you, Mr. Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=7973)|

| 2:13:48| Is part of this a public park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| or is there a park here that's being removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| No, this is private property owned by Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8034)|

| 2:14:08| our private property for their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| It's currently not being maintained for a park, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| 100 percent, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| Commissioner Schelso?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Nick, can you pull up the aerial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8062)|
| 2:14:29| There's often confusion on whether it's a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| because it connects to the park to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| so the local residents' concern about not having a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| There is a park directly south that parcel is a public park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| and it's connected via an unofficial greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| and so I personally have a concern about that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8087)|
| 2:14:52| Do you have a plan to maintain that connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| so that people up there can get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| what's it called, Malcolm Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| Yes, Nathaniel, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| Yes, the greenway is something that is instrumental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| and vital to the success of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| We are proposing a three-phase development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8111)|
| 2:15:12| The goal is to make Knoxville College an inclusive space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| and not just an institution of higher learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| The greenway does connect through the veins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| of the other parks and Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| It does have a creek that is an ideal fabric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8124)|
| 2:15:29| that we will follow to make sure that there are veins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| that connect to that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8132)|
| 2:15:38| Any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| Commissioner, will your partner be KCDC on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| Our partner as far as for co-development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| or architectural, no, our architectural team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| would be McCarty, Holzapple, McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| and our development partner is LHP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| KCDC, we have reached out to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| for support for rental vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| Okay, I just want to make sure I'm clear and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| So, your plan is you're going to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| these access way or greenways and dedicate those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| so the public can use those to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| through the property to the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| There is Beardsley's Farm, CAC, and other amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| that sit right to the, if you're looking at this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| to the left, there's a pool as well on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| This is the Ridgebrook Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| that's neighboring the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Right there, you can almost see the utility greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| carved out for the vegetation and the greenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| That is an area that we would not be building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| That track, you see the little dog leg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| that's coming out of there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| That would be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Okay, so in your next phase, once this zoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| you'd be developing a plan you would come back with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Not today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| But you are committing, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| to create some greenway area for the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| Just let me make sure that this will not come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| We don't plan residential like in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| You've done a lot of this already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| but I think just to make people feel a little better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| would you want to talk a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| about what the plan is in terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| Commissioner, could you bring your microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| a little closer, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| What the plan is in regards to how it's currently being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| to how it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| I know that you plan affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| It's a big site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| I think people are concerned about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| that it is currently being used as a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| whether or not it should or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| And I know that, like you've said already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| there will be some greenway or access preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| Do you want to expound on that at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| just while you've got the floor, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| Yes, might as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| Thank you, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| I do have our architectural professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Nathan Honeycutt, here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| if you'd like to add any of the professional design elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| But again, I opened up with Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| being an inclusive space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8308)|
| 2:18:30| We're looking to bring more density there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| You probably know, if you don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| for the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8314)|
| 2:18:35| Knoxville College has been sitting dormant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| I am the new interim president at Knoxville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| and my role is to revitalize this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| My background is developing affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| for vulnerable populations for the last 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| in the Atlanta, Georgia area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| in communities just like Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8330)|
| 2:18:52| So I automatically looked at affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| as a tool not to just solve an issue for Knoxville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| but also solve an issue for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| And we believe the fabric from our community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| corporation that we established in 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| would allow for us to build that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| create that density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| but also share in the tenancy that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| The goal is to serve those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| that will be living there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| as we are looking to serve those in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| But we would like for that density to live close enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| so they can work, live, and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| on the Knoxville College 58 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| Nate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| Yeah, let me make a comment here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| that plans, whether they're preliminary or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| are not appropriate at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| We're dealing with just sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| one-year plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| The plans could change from day to day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| so I'd be hesitant to make that any issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| Yeah, I almost wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| that that wasn't part of scope of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| I just think people are curious about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| so I figured while you have the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| that's why I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8408)|
| 2:20:09| I wanted to share a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| but I've been here since the start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| and I thought maybe I should give some time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| Unless there's any issues that need to be raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| regarding the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| Yes, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| that we approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| to NDR slash O| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| because it meets the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8434)|

| 2:22:47| William Rotten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| Mr. Romans, would you like to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| or do you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| Opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| So you have up to five minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| If need be, we can extend that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| but try to get within between the two of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| try to get the next five minutes as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| Hey there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| I'm Luke Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| I reside at 1834 East Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| My property is right behind this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| and I'm a long resident of South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| pastor of church in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| and I'm all for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| This development will influence me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| I also represent several other families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| that are connected to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| The Rotten's property is right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| That would be on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| The Brooks family is just connected right over that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| Then you have the Brooks on the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| Of course, the Wilkerson's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| actually the Brooks is going to be on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| My property is on the backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| Just a couple thoughts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| I know you guys do this all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| and I appreciate all you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| but you have some wording there as far as developmental trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| Knoxville is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| We're becoming very much of an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| that people want to build in, this area especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| and I'm not really against the changing of the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8655)|
| 2:24:20| from agriculture to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| I wish I owned the land and we could keep it agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| but that's probably not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| But I am against the developmental trends in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| because the trend is to change the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| Of course, we talked about that earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| with the large piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| the 17 acres across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| This is three acres right really in front of my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8682)|
| 2:24:46| The other houses in that area on the south side of John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| are on several acres of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| My house is on nearly three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| The Brooks' is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| The other Brooks family is on probably three to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| The Rotunds have about 70 or 80 acres there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| And my goal is to look at the current planning in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8708)|
| 2:25:13| and also looking at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| and there is several issues there we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| If all goes well, you don't look at other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| You're going to be looking at nine houses on three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| and I've got one house on about three acres right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| And I want you all to consider the current planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8731)|
| 2:25:35| in that immediate area that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| Also with this being said, you've got this acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| There is a power line going right in the middle of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| on the south side, and there's 150 feet right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8744)|
| 2:25:52| They won't be able to build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| There is a power line that's going right in the middle of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| on the left side, and that is feeding my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| and also the property back through the woods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| And you can't really see that on that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| but there is a telephone pole kind of right in the middle of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| That line would have to be put underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| and there would be a right-of-way or easeway building on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| The recommendation is to put a 50-foot buffer from the property line back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| That would also decrease the amount of property available to be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| And, you know, there's just – I mean, I want to keep this area the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| I want to keep it rural. I want to keep the houses spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| I would hate to have a bunch of houses in there that would congest that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| And as it is currently there, you see the houses are spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| We love the community. We love the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| I think the recommendation is two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8809)|
| 2:26:52| There's only going to be about an acre and a half to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| and I would hate to have any more than two houses on that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| because of the congestion and just the disunity that it would cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| All right? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| My name is Dale Roten, 4315 French Road, adjacent to this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8833)|
| 2:27:21| Yes, there's a TVA tile on the back as a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| It is 150 feet wide by 220 feet long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| and that 150 feet does go over on our neighbor's property about 30 feet probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| So there's probably three-fourths acre there of the TVA power line that you cannot build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| cannot put a septic system on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8860)|
| 2:27:43| Is this septic? Is that what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| You got sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8868)|
| 2:27:49| Okay, so the septic does not also got a power line through the, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| through the middle all the way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| It's a KUB line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| It can be underground, but still you can't build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| That's 15 feet by 600 feet on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| You got 10 feet plus the whole length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| You've also got all those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| You've got roughly an acre and a half, and it's 2.9 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| so you do have about an acre and a half to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8895)|
| 2:28:18| And the rest of it you can't build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| So I would love to consider that in the two per acre that it would be two per buildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| not just because you've got a TVA tower there 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8908)|
| 2:28:34| You can't do anything with that, and you can't do anything with the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| So that would be my recommendation to try to keep it at two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8924)|

| 2:28:57| We were just asking if we could rezone the property to what's similar across the road from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| Most of those lots are about 0.3 acres, 0.4 acres, and that's what we would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8943)|
| 2:29:08| We're looking into rerouting that power line that runs through our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8948)|
| 2:29:12| putting it on the side and go underground with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| And I know we can't do nothing with the TVA line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| but that would be maybe we could get six houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8958)|
| 2:29:26| Any other comments you would like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| I mean, we're asking for less than three units per acre, which is what's across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8968)|
| 2:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| Oh, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8985)|
| 2:29:50| Yeah, a minute ago I talked about or we all kind of agreed that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| the land that we worked on earlier was in the LDR sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=8997)|
| 2:30:03| and we kind of made a distinction about not changing that sector plan or not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9003)|
| 2:30:10| I kind of can't support changing the sector plan here because unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9010)|
| 2:30:16| are there some changing conditions that I'm not aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9016)|
| 2:30:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9020)|
| 2:30:21| Is there new utilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| I know it says here the subdivision across the street, but that's been there 10 years easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9023)|
| 2:30:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Yeah, I'm just kind of hesitant about changing the sector plan here to rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9032)|
| 2:30:39| Just because of what we just did earlier in trying to show that we were respecting that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9039)|
| 2:30:50| If somebody wants to change my mind, I mean, I'll listen to anything, but that's kind of what I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| All right, ladies and gentlemen, any comments you want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9067)|
| 2:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| I was just looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| I think it was number 12 that we dealt with just a little bit ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| It was right across the street, and if I could go back, my memory, I'm getting old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9075)|
| 2:31:23| My memory fails me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| I can't even remember why we went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9084)|
| 2:31:25| They requested five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9085)|
| 2:31:26| We went with three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9086)|
| 2:31:28| There was three in the subdivision down the road, and it made sense to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| and I think it makes sense to do it here and give them three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| So there's no other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| Mr. Graf's got his light on, so I'll hold off on the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| I think we approved 4.85 units per acre on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| I think we approved 4.85 acre on item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9112)|
| 2:32:00| All right, Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| Yeah, at three to the acre, we're only using half the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9124)|
| 2:32:12| so that really gives it the same as being six to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9132)|
| 2:32:18| is what we're really approving on the usable part of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9138)|
| 2:32:25| and I think six to the acre right there is way too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| Commissioner Roth, do you have another question or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| No, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| I'll make a motion we approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9158)|
| 2:32:41| for staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| to approve amending the sector plan to rule residential based on staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9170)|
| 2:32:57| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| We approve plan residential at three dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9189)|
| 2:33:10| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| to approve PR plan residential zoning at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9194)|
| 2:33:21| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Again, before we vote, we're really approving at six to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9202)|
| 2:33:29| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9214)|
| 2:33:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| So, Ms. Cairn, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| If you support the motion for three units per acre, it's yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9220)|
| 2:33:43| and if you oppose it, the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9223)|
